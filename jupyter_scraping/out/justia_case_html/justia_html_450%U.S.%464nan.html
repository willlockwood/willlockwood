The relevant inquiry is not whether the statute is drawn as precisely as it might have been, but whether the line chosen by the California Legislature is within constitutional limitations.  In any event, a gender-neutral statute would frustrate the State\'s interest in effective enforcement, since a female would be less likely to report violations of the statute if she herself would be subject to prosecution.

S. 466</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEWART, and JUSTICE POWELL joined.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether California\'s "statutory rape" law, \xc2\xa7 261.5 of the Cal.Penal Code Ann. (West Supp. 1981), violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Section 261.5 defines unlawful sexual intercourse as "an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years."  The statute thus makes men alone criminally liable for the act of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>In July, 1978, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of Sonoma County, Cal., alleging that petitioner, then a 17 1/2-year-old male, had had unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18, in violation of \xc2\xa7 261.5.  The evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing showed that, at approximately midnight on June 3, 1978, petitioner and two friends approached Sharon, a 16 1/2-year-old female, and her sister as they waited at a bus stop.  Petitioner and Sharon, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 450 U. S. 467</a></p><p> who had already been drinking, moved away from the others and began to kiss.  After being struck in the face for rebuffing petitioner\'s initial advances, Sharon submitted to sexual intercourse with petitioner.  Prior to trial, petitioner sought to set aside the information on both state and federal constitutional grounds, asserting that \xc2\xa7 261.5 unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender.  The trial court and the California Court of Appeal denied petitioner\'s request for relief, and petitioner sought review in the Supreme Court of California.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court held that "section 261.5 discriminates on the basis of sex, because only females may be victims and only males may violate the section."  25 Cal.3d 608, 611, 601 P.2d 572, 574.  The court then subjected the classification to "strict scrutiny," stating that it must be justified by a compelling state interest.  It found that the classification was "supported not by mere social convention, but by the immutable physiological fact that it is the female exclusively who can become pregnant."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Canvassing "the tragic human costs of illegitimate teenage pregnancies," including the large number of teenage abortions, the increased medical risk associated with teenage pregnancies, and the social consequences of teenage childbearing, the court concluded that the State has a compelling interest in preventing such pregnancies.  Because males alone can "physiologically cause the result which the law properly seeks to avoid," the court further held that the gender classification was readily justified as a means of identifying offender and victim.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the California Supreme Court. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 450 U. S. 468</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As is evident from our opinions, the Court has had some difficulty in agreeing upon the proper approach and analysis in cases involving challenges to gender-based classifications.  The issues posed by such challenges range from issues of standing, <em>see Orr v. Orr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/268/case.html">440 U. S. 268</a></span> (1979), to the appropriate standard of judicial review for the substantive classification.  Unlike the California Supreme Court, we have not held that gender-based classifications are "inherently suspect," and thus we do not apply so-called "strict scrutiny" to those classifications.  <em>See Stanton v. Stanton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/7/case.html">421 U. S. 7</a></span> (1975).  Our cases have held, however, that the traditional minimum rationality test takes on a somewhat "sharper focus" when gender-based classifications are challenged.  <em>See Craig v. Boren,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html">429 U. S. 190</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html#210">429 U. S. 210</a></span> n.* (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring).  In <em>Reed v. Reed,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/71/case.html">404 U. S. 71</a></span> (1971), for example, the Court stated that a gender-based classification will be upheld if it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 450 U. S. 469</a></p><p> bears a "fair and substantial relationship" to legitimate state ends, while in <em>Craig v. Boren, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html#197">429 U. S. 197</a></span>, the Court restated the test to require the classification to bear a "substantial relationship" to "important governmental objectives."</p>\n<p>Underlying these decisions is the principle that a legislature may not</p>\n<p>"make overbroad generalizations based on sex which are entirely unrelated to any differences between men and women or which demean the ability or social status of the affected class."</p>\n<p><em>Parham v.

But because the Equal Protection Clause does not "demand that a statute necessarily apply equally to all persons" or require "<em>things which are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as though they were the same,\'" <em>Rinaldi v.

Here, for example, the individual legislators may have voted for the statute for a variety of reasons.  Some legislators may have been concerned about preventing teenage pregnancies, others about protecting young females from physical injury or from the loss of "chastity," and still others about promoting various religious and moral attitudes towards premarital sex.</p>\n<p>The justification for the statute offered by the State and accepted by the Supreme Court of California, is that the legislature sought to prevent illegitimate teenage pregnancies.  That finding, of course, is entitled to great deference.  <em>Reitman v. Mulkey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/369/case.html">387 U. S. 369</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/369/case.html#373">387 U. S. 373</a></span>-374 (1967).  And although our cases establish that the State\'s asserted reason for the enactment of a statute may be rejected, if it "could not have been a goal of the legislation," <em>Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/636/case.html#648">420 U. S. 648</a></span>, n. 16, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p>We are satisfied not only that the prevention of illegitimate pregnancy is at least one of the "purposes" of the statute, but also that the State has a strong interest in preventing such pregancy.  At the risk of stating the obvious, teenage pregnancies, which have increased dramatically over the last two decades, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] have significant social, medical, and economic consequences for both the mother and her child, and the State. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 450 U. S. 471</a></p><p> Of particular concern to the State is that approximately half of all teenage pregnancies end in abortion. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And of those children who are born, their illegitimacy makes them likely candidates to become wards of the State. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>We need not be medical doctors to discern that young men and young women are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse.  Only women may become pregnant, and they suffer disproportionately the profound physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of sexual activity.  The statute at issue here </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 450 U. S. 472</a></p><p> protects women from sexual intercourse at an age when those consequences are particularly severe. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The question thus boils down to whether a State may attack the problem of sexual intercourse and teenage pregnancy directly by prohibiting a male from having sexual intercourse with a minor female. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We hold that such a statute is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 450 U. S. 473</a></p><p> sufficiently related to the State\'s objectives to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p>Because virtually all of the significant harmful and inescapably identifiable consequences of teenage pregnancy fall on the young female, a legislature acts well within its authority when it elects to punish only the participant who, by nature, suffers few of the consequences of his conduct.  It is hardly unreasonable for a legislature acting to protect minor females to exclude them from punishment.  Moreover, the risk of pregnancy itself constitutes a substantial deterrence to young females.  No similar natural sanctions deter males.  A criminal sanction imposed solely on males thus serves to roughly "equalize" the deterrents on the sexes.</p>\n<p>We are unable to accept petitioner\'s contention that the statute is impermissibly underinclusive and must, in order to pass judicial scrutiny, be <em>broadened</em> so as to hold the female as criminally liable as the male.  It is argued that this statute is not <em>necessary</em> to deter teenage pregnancy because a gender-neutral statute, where both male and female would be subject to prosecution, would serve that goal equally well.  The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether the statute is drawn as precisely as it might have been, but whether the line chosen by the California Legislature is within constitutional limitations.  <em>Kahn v. Shevin,</em> 416 U.S. at 3 <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/21/case.html#56">416 U. S. 56</a></span>, n. 10.</p>\n<p>In any event, we cannot say that a gender-neutral statute would be as effective as the statute California has chosen to enact.  The State persuasively contends that a gender-neutral statute would frustrate its interest in effective enforcement.  Its view is that a female is surely less likely to report </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 450 U. S. 474</a></p><p> violations of the statute if she herself would be subject to criminal prosecution. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In an area already fraught with prosecutorial dificulties, we decline to hold that the Equal Protection Clause requires a legislature to enact a statute so broad that it may well be incapable of enforcement. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 450 U. S. 475</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We similarly reject petitioner\'s argument that \xc2\xa7 261.5 is impermissibly overbroad because it makes unlawful sexual intercourse with prepubescent females, who are, by definition, incapable of becoming pregnant.  Quite apart from the fact that the statute could well be justified on the grounds that very young females are particularly susceptible to physical injury from sexual intercourse, <em>see Rundlett v. Oliver,</em> 607 F.2d 495 (CA1 1979), it is ludicrous to suggest that the Constitution requires the California Legislature to limit the scope of its rape statute to older teenagers and exclude young girls.</p>\n<p>There remains only petitioner\'s contention that the statute is unconstitutional as it is applied to him because he, like Sharon, was under 18 at the time of sexual intercourse.  Petitioner argues that the statute is flawed because it presumes that, as between two persons under 18, the male is the culpable aggressor.  We find petitioner\'s contentions unpersuasive.  Contrary to his assertions, the statute does not rest on the assumption that males are generally the aggressors.  It is, instead, an attempt by a legislature to prevent illegitimate teenage pregnancy by providing an additional deterrent for men.  The age of the man is irrelevant, since young men are as capable as older men of inflicting the harm sought to be prevented.</p>\n<p>In upholding the California statute, we also recognize that this is not a case where a statute is being challenged on the grounds that it "invidiously discriminates" against females.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 450 U. S. 476</a></p><p> To the contrary, the statute places a burden on males which is not shared by females.  But we find nothing to suggest that men, because of past discrimination or peculiar disadvantages, are in need of the special solicitude of the courts.  Nor is this a case where the gender classification is made "solely for . . . administrative convenience," as in <em>Frontiero v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html">411 U. S. 677</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/677/case.html#690">411 U.

As we have held, the statute instead reasonably reflects the fact that the consequences of sexual intercourse and pregnancy fall more heavily on the female than on the male.</p>\n<p>Accordingly the judgment of the California Supreme Court is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The lower federal courts and state courts have almost uniformly concluded that statutory rape law are constitutional.  <em>See, e.g., Rundlett v.

Both courts rejected the justification on the grounds that there had been no showing that young females are more likely than males to suffer physical injury from sexual intercourse.  They further held, contrary to our decision, that pregnancy prevention was not a "plausible" purpose of the legislation.  Thus, neither court reached the issue presented here, whether the statute is substantially related to the prevention of teenage pregnancy.  Significantly, <em>Meloon</em> has been severely limlted by <em>Rundlett v. Oliver,</em> 607 F.2d 495 (CA1 1979), where the court upheld a statutory rape law on the ground that the State had shown that sexual intercourse physically injures young women more than males.

A male who engages in sexual intercourse with an underage female who is not his wife violates the statute; a female who engages in sexual intercourse with an underage male who is not her husband does not.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  And members of both sexes may be convicted for engaging in deviant sexual acts with anyone under 18. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Finally, females may be brought within the proscription of \xc2\xa7 261.5 itself, since a female may be charged with aiding and abetting its violation. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 261.5 is thus but one part of a broad statutory scheme that protects all minors from the problems and risks attendant upon adolescent sexual activity.  To be sure, \xc2\xa7 261.5 creates an additional measure of punishment for males who engage in sexual intercourse with females between the ages of 14 and 17. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  The question then is whether the Constitution prohibits a state legislature from imposing this <em>additional</em> sanction on a gender-specific basis.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Constitution is violated when government, state or federal, invidiously classifies similarly situated people on the basis of the immutable characteristics with which they were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 450 U.

By contrast, while detrimental gender classifications by government often violate the Constitution, they do not always do so, for the reason that there are differences between males and females that the Constitution necessarily recognizes.

Young women and men are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and risks associated with intercourse and pregnancy, and the statute is realistically related to the legitimate state purpose of reducing those problems and risks.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>As the California Supreme Court\'s catalog shows, the pregnant unmarried female confronts problems more numerous and more severe than any faced by her male partner. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  She alone endures the medical risks of pregnancy or abortion. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  She suffers disproportionately the social, educational, and emotional consequences of pregnancy.

The risk of pregnancy is a significant deterrent for unwed young females that is not shared by unmarried males, regardless of their age.  Experienced observation confirms the common sense notion that adolescent males disregard the possibility of pregnancy far more than do adolescent females. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  And to the extent that \xc2\xa7 261.5 may punish males for intercourse with prepubescent females, that punishment is justifiable because of the substantial physical risks for prepubescent females that are not shared by their male counterparts.

But the basic social and privacy problems are much the same.  Both Utah\'s statute in <em>Matheson</em> and California\'s statute in this case are legislatively created tools intended to achieve similar ends and addressed to the same societal concerns:  the control and direction of young people\'s sexual activities.  The plurality opinion impliedly concedes as much when it notes that "approximately half of all teenage pregnancies end in abortion," and that "those children who are born" are "likely candidates to become wards of the State," <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#471">450 U.

For me, there is an important difference between this state action and a State\'s adamant and rigid refusal to face, or even to recognize, the "significant . . consequences" -- to the woman -- of a forced or unwanted conception.  I have found it difficult to rule constitutional, for example, state efforts to block, at that later point, a woman\'s attempt to deal with the enormity of the problem confronting her, just as I have rejected state efforts to prevent women from rationally taking </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 450 U.

It claims that its statute furthers this goal by deterring sexual activity by males -- the class of persons it considers more responsible for causing those pregnancies. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  But even assuming that prevention of teenage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 450 U.

S. 491</a></span>-196, California still has the burden of proving that there are fewer teenage pregnancies under its gender-based statutory rape law than there would be if the law were gender-neutral.  To meet this burden, the State must show that, because its statutory rape law punishes only males, and not females, it more effectively deters minor females from having sexual intercourse. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The plurality assumes that a gender-neutral statute would be less effective than \xc2\xa7 261.5 in deterring sexual activity because a gender-neutral statute would create significant enforcement problems.  The plurality thus accepts the State\'s assertion that</p>\n<p>"a female is surely less likely to report violations of the statute if she herself would be subject to crimina prosecution.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 450 U.

S. 473</a></span>-474 (footnotes omitted).  However, a State\'s bare assertion that its gender-based statutory classification substantially furthers an important governmental interest is not enough to meet its burden of proof under <em>Craig v. Boren.</em>  Rather, the State must produce evidence that will persuade the court that its assertion is true.  <em>See Craig v. Boren,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html#200">429 U. S. 200</a></span>-204.</p>\n<p>The State has not produced such evidence in this case.  Moreover, there are at least two serious flaws in the State\'s assertion that law enforcement problems created by a gender-neutral statutory rape law would make such a statute less effective than a gender-based statute in deterring sexual activity.</p>\n<p>First, the experience of other jurisdictions, and California itself, belies the plurality\'s conclusion that a gender-neutral statutory rape law "may well be incapable of enforcement."  There are now at least 37 States that have enacted gender-neutral statutory rape laws.  Although most of these laws protect young persons (of either sex) from the sexual exploitation of older individuals, the laws of Arizona, Florida, and Illinois permit prosecution of both minor females and minor males for engaging in mutual sexual conduct. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  California has introduced no evidence that those States have been handicapped </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 450 U. S. 493</a></p><p> by the enforcement problems the plurality finds so persuasive. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Surely, if those States could provide such evidence, we might expect that California would have introduced it.</p>\n<p>In addition, the California Legislature in recent years has revised other sections of the Penal Code to make them gender-neutral.  For example, Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 286(b)(1) and 288a(b)(1) (West Supp. 1981), prohibiting sodomy and oral copulation with a "person who is under 18 years of age," could cause two minor homosexuals to be subjected to criminal sanctions for engaging in mutually consensual conduct.  Again, the State has introduced no evidence to explain why a gender-neutral statutory rape law would be any more difficult to enforce than those statutes.</p>\n<p>The second flaw in the State\'s assertion is that, even assuming that a gender-neutral statute would be more difficult to enforce, the State has still not shown that those enforcement problems would make such a statute less effective than a gender-based statute in deterring minor females from engaging in sexual intercourse. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  Common sense, however, suggests </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 450 U. S. 494</a></p><p> that a gende-neutral statutory rape law is potentially a rgeater deterrent of sexual activity than a gender-based law, for the simple reason that a gender-neutral law subjects both men and women to criminal sanctions, and thus arguably has a deterrent effect on twice as many potential violators.  Even if fewer persons were prosecuted under the gender-neutral law, as the State suggests, it would still be true that twice as many persons would be subject to arrest.  The State\'s failure to prove that a gender-neutral law would be a less effective deterrent than a gender-based law, like the State\'s failure to prove that a gender-neutral law would be difficult to enforce, should have led this Court to invalidate \xc2\xa7 261.5.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Until very recently, no California court or commentator had suggested that the purpose of California\'s statutory rape law was to protect young women from the risk of pregnancy.  Indeed, the historical development of \xc2\xa7 261.5 demonstrates that the law was initially enacted on the premise that young women, in contrast to young men, were to be deemed legally incapable of consenting to an act of sexual intercourse. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 450 U. S. 495</a></p><p> their chastity was considered particularly precious, those young women were felt to be uniquely in need of the State\'s protection. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  In contrast, young men were assumed to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 450 U. S. 496</a></p><p> be capable of making such decisions for themselves; the law therefore did not offer them any special protection.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps because the gender classifiation in California\'s statutory rape law was initially designed to further these outmoded sexual stereotypes, rather than to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancies, that the State has been unable to demonstrate a substantial relationship beween the classification and its newly asserted goal.  <em>Cf. Califano v. Goldfarb,</em> 430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html#223">430 U. S. 223</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  But whatever the reason, the State has not shown that Cal.Penal Cod \xc2\xa7 261.5 is any more effective than a gender-neutral law would be in deterring minor females from engaging in sexual intercourse.  It has therefore not met its burden of proving that the statutory classification is substantially related to the achievement of its asserted goal.</p>\n<p>I would hold that \xc2\xa7 261.5 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and I would reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court acknowledged, and indeed the parties do not dispute, that Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 261.5 (West Supp. 1981) discriminates on the basis of sex.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#467">450 U. S. 467</a></span>.  Because petitioner is male, he faces criminal felony charges and a possible prison term, while his female partner remains immune from prosecution.  The gender of the participants, not their relative responsibility, determines which of them is subject to criminal sanctions under \xc2\xa7 2615</p>\n<p>As the California Supreme Court stated in <em>People v. Hernandez,</em> 61 Cal.2d 529, 531, 393 P.2d 673, 674 (1964) (footnote omitted):</p>\n<p>"[E]ven in circumstances where a girl\'s actual comprehension contradicts the law\'s presumption [that a minor female is too innocent and naive to understand the implications and nature of her act], the male is deemed criminally responsible for the act, although himself young and naive and responding to advances which may have been made to him."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>None of the three opinions upholding the California statute fairly applies the equal protection analysis this Court has so carefully developed since <em>Craig v. Boren,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html">429 U. S. 190</a></span> (1976).  The plurality opinion, for example, focusing on the obvious and uncontested fact that only females can become pregnant, suggests that the statutory gender discrimination, rather than being invidious, actually ensures equality of treatment.  Since only females are subject. to a risk of pregnancy, the plurality opinion concludes that "[a] criminal sanction imposed solely on males . . . serves to roughly <em>equalize\' the deterrents on the sexes."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#473">450 U. S. 473</a></span>.  JUSTICE STEWART adopts a similar approach.  Recognizing that "females can become pregnant as the result of sexual intercourse; males cannot," JUSTICE STEWART concludes that "[y]oung women and men are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and risks associated with intercourse and pregnancy," and therefore \xc2\xa7 261.5 "is <em>realistically</em> related to the legitimate state purpose of reducing those problems and risks" (emphasis added).  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#478">450 U.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, conceding that some limits must. be placed on a State\'s power to regulate "the control and direction of young people\'s sexual activities," also finds the statute constitutional.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#482">450 U.

He distinguishes the State\'s power in the abortion context, where the pregnancy has already occurred, from its power in the present context, where the "problem [is] at its inception."  He then concludes, without explanation, that "the California statutory rape law . . . is a sufficiently reasoned and constitutional effort to control the problem at its inception."  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>All three of these approaches have a common failing.  They overlook the fact that the State has not met its hurden of proving that the gender discrimination in \xc2\xa7 261.5 is <em>substantially</em> related to the achievement of the State\'s asserted statutory goal.  My Brethren seem not to recognize that California has the burden of proving that a gender-neutral statutory rape law would be less effective than \xc2\xa7 261.5 in deterring sexual activity leading to teenage pregnancy.

According to statistics provided by the State, an average of only 61 juvenile males and 352 adult males were arrested for statutory rape each year between 1975 and 1978.  Brief for Respondent 19.  During each of those years, there were approximately one million Californian girls between the ages of 13-17.  Cal. Dept. of Finance, Population Projections for California Counties, 1975-2020, with Age/Sex Detail to 2000, Series 150 (1977).  Although the record in this case does not indicate the incidence of sexual intercourse involving those girls during that period, the California State Department of Health estimates that there were almost 50,000 pregnancies among 13-to-17-year-old girls during 1976.  Cal.Dept. of Health, Birth and Abortion Records, and Physician Survey of Office Abortions (1976).  I think it is fair to speculate from this evidence that a comparison of the number of arrests for statutory rape in California with the number of acts of sexual intercourse involving minor females in that State would likely demonstrate to a male contemplating sexual activity with a minor female that his chances of being arrested are reassuringly low.  I seriously question, therefore, whether \xc2\xa7 261.5, as enforced, has a substantial deterrent effect . <em>See Craig v.

The age of consent at that time was 12 years, reduced to 10 years in 1576 (18 Eliz. 1, ch. 7, \xc2\xa7 4).  This statute was part of the common law brought to the United States.  Thus, when the first California penal statute was enacted, it contained a provision (1850 Cal.Stats., ch. 99, \xc2\xa7 47, p. 234) that proscribed sexual intercourse with females under the age of 10.  In 1889, the California statute was amended to make the age of consent 14 (1889 Cal.Stats., ch.191, \xc2\xa7 1, p. 223).  In 1897, the age was advanced to 16 (1897 Cal.Stats., ch. 139, \xc2\xa7 1, p. 201).  In 1913, it was fixed at 18, where it now remains (1913 Cal.Stats., ch. 122, \xc2\xa7 1, p. 212).</p>\n<p>Because females generally have not reached puberty by the age of 10, it is inconceivable that a statute designed to prevent pregnancy would be directed at acts of sexual intercourse with females under that age.</p>\n<p>The only legislative history available, the draftsmen\'s notes to the Penal Code of 1872, supports the view that the purpose of California\'s statutory rape law was to protect those who were too young to give consent.

In <em>People v.

It is the insidious approach and vile tampering with their persons that primarily undermines the virtue of young girls, and eventually destroys it; and the prevention of this, as much as the principal act, must undoubtedly have been the intent of the legislature."</p>\n<p>As recently as 1964, the California Supreme Court decided <em>People v.

The law\'s concern with her capacity or lack thereof to so understand is explained in part by a popular conception of the social, moral and personal values which are preserved by the abstinence from sexual indulgence on the part of a young woman.  An unwise disposition of her sexual favor is deemed to do harm both to herself and the social mores by which the community\'s conduct patterns are established.  Hence, the law of statutory rape intervenes in an effort to avoid such a disposition."</p>\n<p>It was only in deciding <em>Michael M.</em> that the California Supreme Court decided, for the first time in the 130-year history of the statute, that pregnancy prevention had become one of the purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Local custom and belief -- rather than statutory laws of venerable but doubtful ancestry -- will determine the volume of sexual activity among unmarried teenagers.

[<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  Nevertheless, as a matter of constitutional power, unlike my Brother BRENNAN, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#491">450 U. S. 491</a></span>, n. 5, I would have no doubt about the validity of a state law prohibiting all unmarried teenagers from engaging in sexual intercourse.  The societal interests in reducing the incidence of venereal disease and teenage pregnancy are sufficient, in my judgment, to justify a prohibition of conduct that increases the risk of those harms. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]</p>\n<p>My conclusion that a nondiscriminatory prohibition would be constitutional does not help me answer the question whether a prohibition applicable to only half of the joint participants in the risk-creating conduct is also valid.  It cannot be true that the validity of a total ban is an adequate justification for a selective prohibition; otherwise, the constitutional objection to discriminatory rules would be meaningless.  The question in this case is whether the difference between males and females justifies this statutory discrimination based entirely on sex.

I think the plurality is quite correct in making the assumption that the joint act that this law seeks to prohibit creates a greater risk of harm for the female than for the male.  But the plurality surely cannot believe that the risk of pregnancy confronted by the female -- any more than the risk of venereal disease confronted by males as well a females -- has provided an effective deterrent to voluntary female participation in the risk-creating conduct.  Yet the plurality\' decision seems to rest on the assumption that the California Legislature acted on the basis of that rather fanciful notion. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 450 U. S. 499</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In my judgment, the fact that a class of persons is especially vulnerable to a risk that a statute is designed to avoid is a reason for making the statute applicable to that class.  The argument that a special need for protection provides a rational explanation for an exemption is one I simply do not comprehend. [<a href="#F4/6" name="T4/6">Footnote 4/6</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, the fact that a female confronts a greater risk of harm than a male is a reason for applying the prohibition to her -- not a reason for granting her a license to use her own judgment on whether or not to assume the risk.  Surely, if we examine the problem from the point of view of society\'s interest in preventing the risk-creating conduct from occurring at all, it is irrational to exempt 50% of the potential violators.  <em>See</em> dissent of JUSICE BRENNAN, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/464/case.html#493">450 U. S. 493</a></span>-494.  And, if we view the government\'s interest as that of a <em>parens patriae</em> seeking to protect its subjects from harming themselves, the discrimination is actually perverse.  Would a rational parent making rules for the conduct of twin children of opposite sex simultaneously forbid the son and authorize the daughter to engage in conduct that is especially harmful to the daughter?  That is the effect of this statutory classification.</p>\n<p>If pregnancy or some other special harm is suffered by one of the two participants in the prohibited act, that special harm no doubt would constitute a legitimate mitigating factor in deciding what, if any, punishment might be appropriate in a given case.  But from the standpoint of fashioning a general preventive rule -- or, indeed, in determining appropriate punishment when neither party in fact has suffered any special </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 450 U. S. 500</a></p><p> harm -- I regard a total exemption for the members of the more endangered class as utterly irrational.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the only acceptable justification for a general rule requiring disparate treatment of the two participants in a joint act must be a legislative judgment that one is more guilty than the other.  The risk-creating conduct that this statute is designed to prevent requires the participation of two persons -- one male and one female. [<a href="#F4/7" name="T4/7">Footnote 4/7</a>]  In many situations, it is probably true that one is the aggressor and the other is either an unwilling, or at least a less willing, participant in the joint act.  If a statute authorized punishment of only one participant and required the prosecutor to prove that that participant had been the aggressor, I assume that the discrimination would be valid.  Although the question is less clear, I also assume, for the purpose of deciding this case, that it would be permissible to punish only the male participant if one element of the offense were proof that he had been the aggressor, or at least in some respects the more responsible participant, in the joint act.  The statute at issue in this case, however, requires no such proof.  The question raised by this statute is whether the State, consistently with the Federal Constitution, may always punish the male and never the female when they are equally responsible or when the female is the more responsible of the two.</p>\n<p>It would seem to me that an impartial lawmaker could give only one answer to that question.  The fact that the California Legislature has decided to apply its prohibition only to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 450 U. S. 501</a></p><p> the male may reflect a legislative judgment that, in the typical case the male is actually the more guilty party.  Any such judgment must, in turn, assume that the decision to engage in the risk-creating conduct is always -- or at least typically -- a male decision.  If that assumption is valid, the statutory classification should also be valid.  But what is the support for the assumption?  It is not contained in the record of this case or in any legislative history or scholarly study that has been called to our attention.  I think it is supported to some extent by traditional attitudes toward male-female relationships.  But the possibility that such a habitual attitude may reflect nothing more than an irrational prejudice makes it an insufficient justification for discriminatory treatment that is otherwise blatantly unfair.  For, as I read this statute, it requires that one, and only one, of two equally guilty wrongdoers be stigmatized by a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept the State\'s argument that the constitutionality of the discriminatory rule can be saved by an assumption that prosecutors will commonly invoke this statute only in cases that actually involve a forcible rape, but one that cannot be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. [<a href="#F4/8" name="T4/8">Footnote 4/8</a>]  That assumption implies that a State has a legitimate interest in convicting a defendant on evidence that is constitutionally insufficient.  Of course, the State may create a lesser-included offense that would authorize punishment of the more guilty party, but surely the interest in obtaining convictions on inadequate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 450 U. S. 502</a></p><p> proof cannot justify a statute that punishes one who is equally or less guilty than his partner. [<a href="#F4/9" name="T4/9">Footnote 4/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor do I find at all persuasive the suggestion that this discrimination is adequately justified by the desire to encourage females to inform against their male partners.  Even if the concept of a wholesale informant\'s exemption were an acceptable enforcement device, what is the justification for defining the exempt class entirely by reference to sex, rather than by reference to a more neutral criterion such as relative innocence?  Indeed, if the exempt class is to be composed entirely of members of one sex, what is there to support the view that the statutory purpose will be better served by granting the informing license to females, rather than to males?  If a discarded male partner informs on a promiscuous female, a timely threat of prosecution might well prevent the precise harm the statute is intended to minimize.</p>\n<p>Finally, even if my logic is faulty and there actually is some speculative basis for treating equally guilty males and females differently, I still believe that any such speculative justification would be outweighed by the paramount interest in evenhanded enforcement of the law.  A rule that authorizes punishment of only one of two equally guilty wrongdoers violates the essence of the constitutional requirement that the sovereign must govern impartially.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Common sense indicates that many young people will engage in sexual activity regardless of what the New York Legislature does, and further, that the incidence of venereal disease and premarital pregnancy is affected by the availability or unavailability of contraceptives.

It may be more accurate to say that the burden of sustaining an equal protection challenge is much heavier in some cases than in others.  Racial classifications, which are subjected to "strict scrutiny," are presumptively invalid because there is seldom, if ever, any legitimate reason for treating citizens differently because of their race.  On the other hand, most economic classifications are presumptively valid because they are a necessary component of most regulatory programs.  In cases involving discrimination between men and women, the natural differences between the sexes are sometimes relevant and sometimes wholly irrelevant.  If those differences are obviously irrelevant, the discrimination should be t.reated as presumptively unlawful in the same way that racial clasifications are presumptively unlawful.  <em>Cf. Califano v. Goldfarb,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html">430 U. S. 199</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html#223">430 U. S. 223</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  But if, as in this case, there is an apparent connection between the discrimination and the fact that only women can become pregnant, it may be appropriate to presume that the classification is lawful.  This presumption, however, may be overcome by a demonstration that the apparent justification for the discrimination is illusory or wholly inadequate.  Thus, instead of applying a "mid-level" form of scrutiny in all sex discrimination cases, perhaps the burden is heavier in some than in others.  Nevertheless, as I have previously suggested, the ultimate standard in these, as in all other equal protection cases, is essentially the same.  <em>See Craig v.

Presumably, the California Supreme Court was referring to the equally indisputable biological fact that only females may become pregnant.
