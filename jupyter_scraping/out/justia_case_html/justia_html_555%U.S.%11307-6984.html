QUARTERMAN, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x936984.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 4, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 13, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">After petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s state conviction for burglary became final on October 11, 1996, the state appellate court held in state habeas proceedings that petitioner had been denied his right to appeal and granted him the right to file an out-of-time appeal.  He filed the appeal, his conviction was affirmed, and his time for seeking certiorari in this Court expired on January 6, 2004.  Petitioner filed a second state habeas application on December 6, 2004, which was denied 355 days later, on June 29, 2005.  He then filed a federal habeas petition on July 19, 2005, relying on 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) to establish its timeliness.  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) provides that the one-year limitations period for seeking review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) begins on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner argued that his judgment became final on January 6, 2004, when time expired for seeking certiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal, and that his July 19, 2005, petition was timely because the calculation of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitation period excludes the 355 days \xe2\x80\x9cduring which [his] properly filed application for State post-conviction \xe2\x80\xa6 review \xe2\x80\xa6 [was] pending,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  The District Court disagreed, ruling that the proper start date for calculating AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) was October 11, 1996, when petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction first became final.  The District Court dismissed the federal habeas petition as time barred.  The Fifth Circuit denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for a certificate of appealability.   </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Where a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) until the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking certiorari review of that appeal.  This Court must enforce plain statutory language according to its terms.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 534.  Under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, once the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reopened direct review of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on September 25, 2002, the conviction was no longer final for \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) purposes.  Rather, the order granting an out-of-time appeal restored the pendency of the direct appeal, and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was again capable of modification through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certiorari review.  Therefore, it was not until January 6, 2004, when time for seeking certiorari review of the decision in the out-of-time appeal expired, that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  The Court rejects respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that using the later date created by the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reopen direct review, thus resetting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period, undermines the policy of finality that Congress established in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).

That year runs from the latest of four specified dates.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  This case involves the date provided by \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), which is \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioner contends that \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final\xe2\x80\x9d can be postponed by a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision during collateral review to grant a defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal.  The District Court disagreed, holding instead that the date could not be moved to reflect the out-of-time appeal, and that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition was untimely for that reason.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.  See \xc2\xa72253(c).  We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After petitioner was sentenced for burglary in 1995, his attorney filed an appellate brief with the Texas Court of Appeals pursuant to <em>Anders</em> v. <em>California</em>, 386 U. S.<em> </em>738 (1967), explaining that he was unable to identify any nonfrivolous ground on which to base an appeal.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He left a copy of the brief and a letter (advising petitioner of his right to file a <em>pro se </em>brief as set forth in <em>Anders</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 744) at the county jail where he believed petitioner to be.  Petitioner, however, had been transferred to a state facility and did not receive the delivery.  The Texas Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on September 11, 1996, and served petitioner with notice of the dismissal at the county-jail address that, again, was the wrong address.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner eventually learned that his appeal had been dismissed.  He filed an application in state court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07 (Vernon 1977), arguing that he was denied his right to a meaningful appeal when he was denied the opportunity to file a <em>pro se </em>brief.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and, on September 25, 2002, granted petitioner the right to file an out-of-time appeal:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Petitioner] is entitled to an out-of-time appeal in cause number CR\xe2\x80\x9391\xe2\x80\x930528\xe2\x80\x93B in the 119th Judicial District Court of Tom Green County.  [Petitioner] is ordered returned to that point in time at which he may give written notice of appeal so that he may then, with the aid of counsel, obtain a meaningful appeal.  For purposes of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, all time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had been imposed on the date that the mandate of this Court issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Jimenez,</em> No. 74,433 <em>(per curiam)</em>, App. 26, 27.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner thereafter filed the out-of-time appeal.  His conviction was affirmed.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied discretionary review on October 8, 2003.  Time for seeking certiorari review of that decision with this Court expired on January 6, 2004.  On December 6, 2004, petitioner filed a second application for a writ of habeas corpus in state court; it was denied on June 29, 2005.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner then filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus on July 19, 2005.  To establish the timeliness of his petition, he relied on 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), which provides \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d as the trigger for AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period.  Petitioner argued that his judgment thus became final on January 6, 2004,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] when time expired for seeking certiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal.  Until that date, petitioner argued, direct review of his state-court conviction was not complete.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With January 6, 2004, as the start date, petitioner contended that his July 19, 2005, petition was timely because the statute excludes from the 1-year limitations period \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Petitioner had a state habeas application pending from December 6, 2004, through June 29, 2005, so less than one year of included time\xe2\x80\x94specifically, 355 days\xe2\x80\x94passed between January 6, 2004, and July 19, 2005.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court disagreed and dismissed the federal habeas petition as time barred.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the proper start date for AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period was October 11, 1996, when time for seeking discretionary review of the decision in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first direct appeal expired.  The District Court concluded that it could not take into account the Texas court\xe2\x80\x99s later decision reopening petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s direct appeal because Circuit precedent established that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98AEDPA provides for only a linear limitations period, one that starts and ends on specific dates, with only the possibility that tolling will expand the period in between.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Order, Civ. Action No. 6:05\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9305\xe2\x80\x93C (ND Tex., Oct. 23, 2006), App. 75, 90 (quoting <em>Salinas </em>v. <em>Dretke</em>, 354 F.\xc2\xa03d 425, 429 (CA5 2004)).  Therefore, the District Court reasoned, the limitations period began on October 11, 1996, and ended on October 11, 1997, because petitioner had not sought any state or federal collateral review by that date.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for a certificate of appealability, finding that he had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the \xc2\xa72254 petition is time-barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order, No. 06\xe2\x80\x9311240, (May 25, 2007), App. 124, 125.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S.\n___ (2008), and now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with any question of statutory interpretation, our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 534 (2004).  It is well established that, when the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dodd</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/353/index.html">545 U. S. 353</a>, 359 (2005); <em>Lamie</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 534; <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/1/index.html">530 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (2000); <em>Caminetti</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/242/470/index.html">242 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1917).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties agree that the statutory provision that determines the timeliness of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition is 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  That subsection defines the starting date for purposes of the 1-year AEDPA limitations period as \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only disputed question before us is whether the date on which direct review became \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute is October 11, 1996, when petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction initially became final, or January 6, 2004, when the out-of-time appeal granted by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals became final.  We agree with petitioner that, under the plain meaning of the statutory text, the latter date controls.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finality is a concept that has been \xe2\x80\x9cvariously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/522/index.html">537 U. S. 522</a>, 527 (2003).  But here, the finality of a state-court judgment is expressly defined by statute as \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to postconviction relief for federal prisoners, this Court has held that the conclusion of direct review occurs when \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 527, 528\xe2\x80\x93532 (interpreting \xc2\xa72255, \xc2\xb66(1)).  We have further held that if the federal prisoner chooses not to seek direct review in this Court, then the conviction becomes final when \xe2\x80\x9cthe time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 527.  In construing the similar language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), we see no reason to depart from this settled understanding, which comports with the most natural reading of the statutory text.  See <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/327/index.html">549 U. S. 327</a>, 332\xe2\x80\x93335 (2007) (citing <em>Clay</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 528, n.\xc2\xa03).  As a result, direct review cannot conclude for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) until the \xe2\x80\x9cavailability of direct appeal to the state courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Caspari</em> v. <em>Bohlen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/383/index.html">510 U. S. 383</a>, 390 (1994), and to this Court, <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 332\xe2\x80\x93333, has been exhausted.  Until that time, the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess of direct review\xe2\x80\x9d has not \xe2\x80\x9ccom[e] to an end\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca presumption of finality and legality\xe2\x80\x9d cannot yet have \xe2\x80\x9cattache[d] to the conviction and sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barefoot</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/880/index.html">463 U. S. 880</a>, 887 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the statutory definition, therefore, once the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reopened direct review of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on September 25, 2002,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was no longer final for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  Rather, the order \xe2\x80\x9cgranting an out-of-time appeal restore[d] the pendency of the direct appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ex parte Torres</em>, 943 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 469, 472 (Tex.\xc2\xa0Crim.\xc2\xa0App. 1997), and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was again capable of modification through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certiorari review.  Therefore, it was not until January 6, 2004, when time for seeking certiorari review in this Court expired, that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent objects, observing that the Court has previously acknowledged Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent \xe2\x80\x9cto advance the finality of criminal convictions\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9ctight time line\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), <em>Mayle</em> v. <em>Felix</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/644/index.html">545 U. S. 644</a>, 662 (2005), which \xe2\x80\x9cpinpoint[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a uniform federal date of finality that does not \xe2\x80\x9cvary from State to State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Clay</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 530, 531.<font b="1">  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view, permitting a state court to reopen direct review, and thus reset AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period, undermines the policy of finality that Congress established in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  But it is the plain language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) that pinpoints the uniform date of finality set by Congress.  And that language points to the conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in state court.  The statute thus carries out \xe2\x80\x9cAEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s goal of promoting \xe2\x80\x98comity, finality, and federalism\xe2\x80\x99 by giving state courts \xe2\x80\x98the first opportunity to review [the] claim,\xe2\x80\x99 and to \xe2\x80\x98correct\xe2\x80\x99 any \xe2\x80\x98constitutional violation in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U.

The statute requires a federal court, presented with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s first petition for habeas relief, to make use of the date on which the entirety of the state direct appellate review process was completed.

In such a case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\xe2\x80\x9d must reflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.

He entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to the burglary and true to the enhancement in exchange for an order of deferred adjudication.  In November 1991, the trial court deferred adjudication of the burglary conviction and ordered that petitioner serve five years of deferred-adjudication probation.  In March 1995, the State moved to revoke petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s probation based on four alleged violations of the conditions of his probation.  At a November 1995 hearing, petitioner admitted to two of the violations.  The court then heard testimony with respect to the other two violations and found that petitioner had committed those violations as well.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d).  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s underlying constitutional claim,\xe2\x80\x9d as here, a certificate of appealability should issue only when the prisoner shows both \xe2\x80\x9cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right <em>and</em> that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 484 (2000) (emphasis added).  We make no judgment regarding the merits of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional claims.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We do not here decide whether petitioner could have sought timely federal habeas relief between October 11, 1997, when the 1-year limitations period initially expired, and September 25, 2002, when the state court ordered that his direct review be reopened.  Were such a petition timely, though, it would not be through application of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) because we have previously held that the possibility that a state court may reopen direct review \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not render convictions and sentences that are no longer subject to direct review nonfinal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Beard</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/406/index.html">542 U. S. 406</a>, 412 (2004).  We do not depart from that rule here; we merely hold that, where a state court has in fact reopened direct review, the conviction is rendered nonfinal for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) during the pendency of the reopened appeal.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
