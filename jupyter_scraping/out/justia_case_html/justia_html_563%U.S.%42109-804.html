Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, increased by compound interest.  The new plan translated already-earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the cash balance account.  Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s notice of the changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits.  The District Court found that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosures violated its obligations under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  In determining relief, it found that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s notice defects had caused the employees \xe2\x80\x9clikely harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  It then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits accordingly, finding its authority in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), which authorizes a plan \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant or beneficiary\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crecover benefits due \xe2\x80\xa6 under the terms of his plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Second Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Although \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority to reform CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s plan, relief is authorized by \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), which allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain other appropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d to redress violations of ERISA \xe2\x80\x9cor the [plan\xe2\x80\x99s] terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The court ordered relief in two steps.  Step 1: It ordered the terms of the plan reformed.  Step 2: It ordered CIGNA to enforce the plan as reformed.  Step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the \xe2\x80\x9cterms of [the reformed] plan\xe2\x80\x9d and is thus consistent with \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  However, that provision\xe2\x80\x94which speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cenforc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, not changing<em> </em>them\xe2\x80\x94does not suggest that it authorizes a court to alter those terms here, where the change, akin to reforming a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.  Nor can the Court accept the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s alternative rationale: that the District Court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they are plan terms.  That reading cannot be squared with ERISA \xc2\xa7102(a), which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions, but does not suggest that information about<em> </em>the plan provided by those disclosures is itself part of<em> </em>the plan.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) suggests the contrary.  The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s reading also cannot be squared with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s division of authority between a plan\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor\xe2\x80\x94who, like a trust\xe2\x80\x99s settlor, creates the plan\xe2\x80\x99s basic terms and conditions, executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument a procedure for making amendments\xe2\x80\x94and the plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrator\xe2\x80\x94a trustee-like fiduciary who manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions.  ERISA carefully distinguishes these roles, and there is no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summaries, even when, as here, the administrator is also the plan sponsor.  Finally, it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a summary\xe2\x80\x99s language legally binding with the basic summary plan description objective of clear, simple communication.

S. 356</a>, 361.  This case\xe2\x80\x94concerning a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s suit against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust)\xe2\x80\x94is the kind of lawsuit that, before the merger, could have been brought only in an equity court, where the remedies available were traditionally considered equitable remedies.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions obviously fall within this category.  The other relief it ordered closely resembles three forms of traditional equitable relief.  First, what the court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms, in order to remedy false or misleading information CIGNA provided.  The power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court and is used to prevent fraud.  Second, the part of the remedy holding CIGNA to its promise that the new plan would not take from its employees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel, also a traditional equitable remedy.  Third, the injunctions require the plan administrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed.  Equity courts possessed the power to provide monetary \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d for a loss resulting from a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s unjust enrichment.  That surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d for violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm will depend on the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief.  That court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance, but there are several equitable principles that it might apply on remand.  Neither ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s relevant substantive provisions nor \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) sets a particular standard for determining harm.  And equity law provides no general principle that \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental reliance\xe2\x80\x9d must be proved before a remedy is decreed.  To the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that requirement.  Thus, when a court exercises authority under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.  However, equity courts did not insist on a detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected the substance of a contract.  Nor did they require a detrimental reliance showing when they ordered surcharge.  They simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s breach of trust.  This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance requirement.  To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of detrimental reliance.  But it might also come from the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents.  It is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here, in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on the summaries.  Thus, to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.

Previously, the plan provided a retiring employee with a defined benefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of his preretirement salary and length of service.  The new plan provided most retiring employees with a (lump sum) cash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual contribution from CIGNA as increased by compound interest.  Because many employees had already earned at least some old-plan benefits, the new plan translated already-earned benefits into an opening amount in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s cash balance account.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, acting on behalf of approximately 25,000 beneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (which is also a petitioner here), challenged CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the new plan.  They claimed in part that CIGNA had failed to give them proper notice of changes to their benefits, particularly because the new plan in certain respects provided them with less generous benefits.  See Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(a), 104(b), 204(h), 88 Stat. 841, 848, 862, as amended, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court agreed that the disclosures made by CIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA.  In determining relief, the court found that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s notice failures had caused the employees \xe2\x80\x9clikely harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits accordingly.  It found legal authority for doing so in ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) (authorizing a plan \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant or beneficiary\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crecover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied the correct legal standard, namely, a \xe2\x80\x9clikely harm\xe2\x80\x9d standard, in determining that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s notice violations caused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal relief.  To reach that question, we must first consider a more general matter\xe2\x80\x94whether the ERISA section just mentioned (ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s recovery-of-benefits-due provision, \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District Court provided.  We conclude that it does not authorize this relief.  Nonetheless, we find that a different equity-related ERISA provision, to which the District Court also referred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that the court entered.  \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 502(a)(3) authorizes \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for violations of ERISA.  Accordingly, the relevant standard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief.  We leave it to the District Court to conduct that analysis in the first instance, but we identify equitable principles that the court might apply on remand.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because our decision rests in important part upon the circumstances present here, we shall describe those circumstances in some detail.  We still simplify in doing so.  But the interested reader can find a more thorough description in two District Court opinions, which set forth that court\xe2\x80\x99s findings reached after a lengthy trial.  See 559 F. Supp. 2d 192 (Conn. 2008); 534 F. Supp. 2d 288 (Conn. 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1998 defined-benefit retirement plan, an employee with at least five years service would receive an annuity annually paying an amount that depended upon the employee\xe2\x80\x99s salary and length of service.  Depending on when the employee had joined CIGNA, the annuity would equal either (1) 2 percent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s average salary over his final three years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 30); or (2) 1<font super="1">2<font super="-1">3 percent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s average salary over his final five years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years worked (up to 35).  Calculated either way, the annuity would approach 60 percent of a longtime employee\xe2\x80\x99s final salary.  A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say, $160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity paying the employee about $96,000 per year until his death.  The plan offered many employees at least one other benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and receive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.</font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a newsletter announcing that it intended to put in place a new pension plan.  The new plan would substitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccount balance plan\xe2\x80\x9d for CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing defined-benefit system.  App. 991a (emphasis deleted).  The newsletter added that the old plan would end on December 31, 1997, that CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan sometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply retroactively to January 1, 1998.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details.  Its new plan created an individual retirement account for each employee.  (The account consisted of a bookkeeping entry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.)  Each year CIGNA would contribute to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s individual account an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5 percent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s salary, depending upon age, length of service, and certain other factors.  The account balance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to the return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter percent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9 percent).  Upon retirement the employee would receive the amount then in his or her individual account\xe2\x80\x94in the form of either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum then would buy.  As promised, CIGNA would open the accounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1, 1998.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what about the retirement benefits that employees had already earned prior to January 1, 1998?  CIGNA promised to make an initial contribution to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s account equal to the value of that employee\xe2\x80\x99s already earned benefits.  And the new plan set forth a method for calculating that initial contribution.  The method consisted of calculating the amount as of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s (future) retirement date of the annuity to which the employee\xe2\x80\x99s salary and length of service already (<em>i.e.</em>, as of December 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting that sum to its present (<em>i.e.</em>, January 1, 1998) value.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An example will help: Imagine an employee born on January 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on his 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preceding the plan changeover) earned an average salary of $100,000 per year.  As of January 1, 1998, the old plan would have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to $100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 1<font super="1">2<font super="-1">3 percent, or $11,667 per year\xe2\x80\x94when he retired in 2031 at age 65.  The 2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until death depends upon interest rates and mortality assumptions at that time.  If we assume the annuity would pay 7 percent until the holder\xe2\x80\x99s death (and we use the mortality assumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporating the mortality table prescribed by Rev. Rul. 95\xe2\x80\x936, 1995\xe2\x80\x931 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an annuity would be about $120,500.  And CIGNA should initially deposit in this individual\xe2\x80\x99s account on January 1, 1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33 years later, in 2031, when the individual retires.  If we assume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that amount presently (<em>i.e.</em>, as of January 1, 1998) equals about $24,000.  And (with one further mortality-related adjustment that we shall describe <em>infra</em>,<em> </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x937) that is the amount, more or less, that the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s transition rules would have required CIGNA initially to deposit.  Then CIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the deposited amounts would earn compound interest.  When the employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump sum.</font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An employee would receive upon retirement either (1) the amount to which he or she had become entitled as of January 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her individual account, whichever was greater.  Thus, the employee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less than an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court found that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial descriptions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and misled its employees.  In November 1997, for example, CIGNA sent the employees a newsletter that said the new plan would \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly enhance\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cretirement program,\xe2\x80\x9d would produce \xe2\x80\x9can overall improvement in \xe2\x80\xa6 retirement benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d and would provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe same benefit security\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9csteadier benefit growth.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 990a, 991a, 993a.  CIGNA also told its employees that they would \xe2\x80\x9csee the growth in [their] total retirement benefits from CIGNA every year,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 952a, that its initial deposit \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ed] the full value of the benefit [they] earned for service before 1998,\xe2\x80\x9d Record E\xe2\x80\x93503 (Exh. 98), and that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne advantage the company <em>will not</em> get from the retirement program changes is cost savings.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 993a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the new plan saved the company $10 million annually (though CIGNA later said it devoted the savings to other employee benefits).  Its initial deposit did not \xe2\x80\x9crepresen[t] the full value of the benefit\xe2\x80\x9d that employees had \xe2\x80\x9cearned for service before 1998.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the plan made a significant number of employees worse off in at least the following specific ways:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that the old plan offered many CIGNA employees the right to retire early (beginning at age 55) with only somewhat reduced benefits.  This right was valuable.  For example, as of January 1, 1998, respondent Janice Amara had earned vested age-55 retirement benefits of $1,833 per month, but CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit in her new-plan individual retirement account (ignoring this benefit) would have allowed her at age 55 to buy an annuity benefit of only $900 per month.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, as we previously indicated but did not explain, <em>supra </em>at 5, the new plan adjusted CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit downward to account for the fact that, unlike the old plan\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime annuity, an employee\xe2\x80\x99s survivors would receive the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s benefits (namely, the amount in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s individual account) even if the employee died before retiring.  The downward adjustment consisted of multiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the probability that the employee would live until retirement\xe2\x80\x94a 90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  And that meant that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit in our example\xe2\x80\x94the amount that was supposed to grow to $120,500 by 2031\xe2\x80\x94would be less than $22,000, not $24,000 (the number we computed).  The employee, of course, would receive a benefit in return\xe2\x80\x94namely, a form of life insurance.  But at least some employees might have preferred the retirement benefit and consequently could reasonably have thought it important to know that the new plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned benefits for a life insurance policy that they might not have wanted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest rates from CIGNA to its employees.  Under the old plan, CIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling interest rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for that annuity.  And falling interest rates also meant that any sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow more slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set aside more money to make any specific sum available at retirement.  Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to buy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific sum.  The employee would simply receive whatever sum his account contained.  And falling interest rates meant that the account\xe2\x80\x99s lump sum would earn less money each year after the employee retired.  Annuities, for example, would become more expensive (any fixed purchase price paying for less annual income).  At the same time falling interest meant that the individual account would grow more slowly over time, leaving the employee with less money at retirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leaving CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s employees better off under the new plan.  But the latter advantage does not cancel out the former disadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse.  And that means that most of CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s employees would have preferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The amounts likely involved are significant.  If, in our example, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4 percent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in 2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent we assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an initial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that employee the $11,667 annual annuity payment to which he had already become entitled.  Indeed, that $24,000 that CIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life-insurance problem) would have provided enough money to buy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an annual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than $11,667).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that the employee in our example (like others) might have continued to work for CIGNA after January 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have earned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was worth far more than $11,667.  But that is so because CIGNA made an <em>additional </em>contribution for each year worked <em>after </em>January 1, 1998.  If interest rates fell (as they did), it would take the employee several additional years of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to where he had already been (under the old plan) as of January 1, 1998\xe2\x80\x94a phenomenon known in pension jargon as \xe2\x80\x9cwear away,\xe2\x80\x9d see 534 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (referring to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees nothing about any of these features of the new plan\xe2\x80\x94which individually and together made clear that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.  The District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally misled its employees.  A focus group and many employees asked CIGNA, for example, to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[d]isclose details\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d about the plan, to provide \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98individual comparisons,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or  to show \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]n actual projection for retirement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 342.  But CIGNA did not do so.  Instead (in the words of one internal document), it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98focus[ed] on NOT providing employees before and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s representations (and omissions) about the plan, made between November 1997 (when it announced the plan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect) violated:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a) ERISA \xc2\xa7204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa71.411(d)\xe2\x80\x936, 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.411(d)\xe2\x80\x936 (2000), which (as it existed at the relevant time) forbade an amendment of a pension plan that would \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual\xe2\x80\x9d unless the plan administrator also sent a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice\xe2\x80\x9d that provided either the text of the amendment or summarized its likely effects, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001); Treas. Reg. \xc2\xa71.411(d)\xe2\x80\x936, Q&amp;A\xe2\x80\x9310, 63 Fed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. III).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court then turned to the remedy.  First, the court agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain relief.  But it did not require each individual member of the relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual injury.  Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented had raised a presumption of \xe2\x80\x9clikely harm\xe2\x80\x9d suffered by the members of the relevant employee class, and (2) that CIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect to some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that presumption.  It concluded that this unrebutted showing was sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the court noted that \xc2\xa7204(h) had been interpreted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to the 2001 amendment that made this power explicit.  559 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing <em>Frommert</em> v. <em>Conkright</em>, 433 F.\xc2\xa03d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71054(h)(6) (2006 ed.) (entitling participants to benefits \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to [the] amendment\xe2\x80\x9d in case of an \xe2\x80\x9cegregious failure\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the court also thought that granting this relief here would harm, not help, the injured employees.  That is because the notice failures all concerned the new plan that took effect in December 1998.  The court thought that the notices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits, effective December 31, 1997, were valid.  To strike the new plan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not help CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court considered treating the November 1997 notice as a sham or treating that notice and the later 1998 notices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.  But it pointed out that respondents \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] argued none of these things.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 208.  And it said that the court would \xe2\x80\x9cnot make these arguments now on [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee.  It erased the portion that assured participants who retired the greater of \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d (that which they had already earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan, $11,667 in our example) <em>or</em> \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d (that which they would earn via CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s annual deposits under the new plan, <em>including</em> CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit).  And it substituted a provision that would guarantee each employee \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d (that which they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan) <em>plus</em> \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d (that which they would earn via CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s annual deposits under the new plan, <em>excluding</em> CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit).  In our example, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedy would no longer force our employee to choose upon retirement <em>either </em>an $11,667 annuity <em>or </em>his new plan benefits (including both CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s annual deposits and CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit).  It would give him an $11,667 annuity <em>plus </em>his new plan benefits (with CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s annual deposits but without CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s initial deposit).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the court \xe2\x80\x9corder[ed] and enjoin[ed] the CIGNA Plan to reform its records to reflect that all class members \xe2\x80\xa6 now receive [the just described] \xe2\x80\x98A + B\xe2\x80\x99 benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it pay appropriate benefits to those class members who had already retired.  <em>Id.</em>, at 222.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the court held that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) provided the legal authority to enter this relief.  That provision states that a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action may be brought\xe2\x80\x9d by a plan \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant or beneficiary \xe2\x80\xa6 to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  The court wrote that its orders in effect awarded \xe2\x80\x9cbenefits under the terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d as reformed.  559 F. Supp. 2d, at 212.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time the court considered whether ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.  That provision states that a civil action may be brought </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cby a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other <em>appropriate equitable relief</em> (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe District Court decided not to answer this question because (1) it had just decided that the same relief was available under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), regardless, cf. <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 515 (1996); and (2) the Supreme Court has \xe2\x80\x9cissued several opinions \xe2\x80\xa6 that have severely curtailed the kinds of relief that are available under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3),\xe2\x80\x9d 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205 (citing <em>Sereboff</em> v. \n<em>Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/356/index.html">547 U. S. 356</a> (2006); <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Knudson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/204/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/204/index.html">534 U.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a brief summary order, rejecting all their claims, and affirming \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated\xe2\x80\x9d in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwell-reasoned and scholarly opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d  348 Fed. Appx. 627 (2009).  The parties filed cross-petitions for writs of certiorari in this Court.  We granted the request in CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s petition to consider whether a showing of \xe2\x80\x9clikely harm\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits based on faulty disclosures.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CIGNA in the merits briefing raises a preliminary question.  Brief for Petitioners 13\xe2\x80\x9320.  It argues first and foremost that the statutory provision upon which the District Court rested its orders, namely, the provision for recovery of plan benefits, \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), does not in fact authorize the District Court to enter the kind of relief it entered here.  And for that reason, CIGNA argues, whether the District Court did or did not use a proper standard for determining harm is beside the point.  We believe that this preliminary question is closely enough related to the question presented that we shall consider it at the outset.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court ordered relief in two steps.  Step 1: It ordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they provided an \xe2\x80\x9cA plus B,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater of A or B\xe2\x80\x9d guarantee).  Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator (which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as reformed.  One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the right to bring a civil action to \xe2\x80\x9crecover benefits due \xe2\x80\xa6 under the terms of his plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  And step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the \xe2\x80\x9cterms of [the] plan\xe2\x80\x9d <em>as reformed</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what about step 1?  Where does \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) grant a court the power to <em>change </em>the terms of the plan as they previously existed?  The statutory language speaks of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>enforc[ing]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>the \xe2\x80\x9cterms of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d not of <em>changing </em>them.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added).  The provision allows a court to look outside the plan\xe2\x80\x99s written language in deciding what those terms are, <em>i.e.</em>, what the language means.  See <em>UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America</em> v. <em>Ward</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/358/index.html">526 U. S. 358</a>, 377\xe2\x80\x93379 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms of an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of state insurance rules).  But we have found nothing suggesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those terms, at least not in present circumstances, where that change, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a contract as written and more like an equitable remedy.  See <em>infra</em>,<em> </em>at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can we accept the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s alternative rationale seeking to justify the use of this provision.  The Solicitor General says that the District Court did enforce the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms as written, adding that the \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d includes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan descriptions.  In other words, in the view of the Solicitor General, the terms of the summaries are terms of the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries \nas plan \xe2\x80\x9cterms\xe2\x80\x9d (which it did not, see <em>supra</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311), however, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily required plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifications) necessarily may be enforced (under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B)) as the terms of the plan itself.  For one thing, it is difficult to square the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute with ERISA \xc2\xa7102(a), the provision that obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descriptions.  The syntax of that provision, requiring that participants and beneficiaries be advised of their rights and obligations \xe2\x80\x9cunder the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the information <em>about </em>the plan provided by those disclosures is not itself <em>part of </em>the plan.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71022(a).  Nothing in \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) (or, as far as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s reading with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s division of authority between a plan\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor and the plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrator.  The plan\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor (<em>e.g.</em>, the employer), like a trust\xe2\x80\x99s settlor, creates the basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a written instrument containing those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument \xe2\x80\x9ca procedure\xe2\x80\x9d for making amendments.  \xc2\xa7402, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71102.  The plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so, and provides participants with the summary documents that describe the plan (and modifications) in readily understandable form.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73(21)(A), 101(a), 102, 104, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024 (2006 ed. and Supp. III).  Here, the District Court found that the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles.  See 534 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 331.  But that is not always the case.  Regardless, we have found that ERISA carefully distinguishes these roles.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Varity Corp.</em>, 516 U. S., at 498.  And we have no reason to believe that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including them in the summary plan descriptions.  See <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp.</em> v. <em>Schoonejongen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/73/index.html">514 U. S. 73</a>, 81\xe2\x80\x9385 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we find it difficult to reconcile the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation with the basic summary plan description objective: clear, simple communication.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72(a), 102(a), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001(a), 1022(a) (2006 ed.).  To make the language of a plan summary legally binding could well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity and comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in the language of lawyers.  Consider the difference between a will and the summary of a will or between a property deed and its summary.  Consider, too, the length of Part I of this opinion, and then consider how much longer Part I would have to be if we had to include all the qualifications and nuances that a plan drafter might have found important and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions take up 109 pages of the Federal<em> </em>Supplement.  None of this is to say that plan administrators can avoid providing complete and accurate summaries of plan terms in the manner required by ERISA and its implementing regulations.  But we fear that the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s rule might bring about complexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the summaries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons taken together we conclude that the summary documents, important as they are, provide communication with beneficiaries <em>about </em>the plan, but that their statements do not themselves constitute the <em>terms </em>of the plan for purposes of \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  We also conclude that the District Court could not find authority in that section to reform CIGNA\xe2\x80\x99s plan as written.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) does not authorize entry of the relief here at issue, what about nearby \xc2\xa7502(a)(3)?  That provision allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain other <em>appropriate equitable relief</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to redress violations of (here relevant) parts of ERISA \xe2\x80\x9cor the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3) (emphasis added).  The District Court strongly implied, but did not directly hold, that it would base its relief upon this subsection were it not for (1) the fact that the preceding \xe2\x80\x9cplan benefits due\xe2\x80\x9d provision, \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), provided sufficient authority; and (2) certain cases from this Court that narrowed the application of the term \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mertens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html"></a><a href="/us/508/248/index.html">508 U. S. 248</a>; <em>Great-West</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/204/index.html"></a><a href="/us/534/204/index.html">534 U. S. 204</a>.  Our holding in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>, removes the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s first obstacle.  And given the likelihood that, on remand, the District Court will turn to and rely upon this alternative subsection, we consider the court\xe2\x80\x99s second concern.  We find that concern misplaced.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) as referring to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98those categories of relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that, traditionally speaking (<em>i.e.</em>, prior to the merger of law and equity) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98were <em>typically</em> available in equity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sereboff</em>, 547 U. S., at 361 (quoting <em>Mertens</em>, 508 U. S., at 256).  In <em>Mertens</em>, we applied this principle to a claim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary against a private firm that provided a trustee with actuarial services.  We found that the plaintiff sought \xe2\x80\x9cnothing other than compensatory damages\xe2\x80\x9d against a nonfiduciary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 253, 255 (emphasis deleted).  And we held that such a claim, traditionally speaking, was legal, not equitable, in nature.  <em>Id.</em>, at 255.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Great-West</em>, we considered a claim brought by a fiduciary against a tort-award-winning beneficiary seeking monetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan had previously made on the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  We noted that the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to (or a constructive trust imposed upon) money that the beneficiary had received from the tort-case defendant.  But we noted that the money in question was not the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular\xe2\x80\x9d money that the tort defendant had paid.  And, traditionally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive trust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds in question were \xe2\x80\x9c<em>particular</em> funds or property in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U. S., at 213 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary against a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust).  See <em>LaRue</em> v. <em>DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Associates, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/248/index.html">552 U. S. 248</a>, 253, n.\xc2\xa04 (2008); <em>Varity Corp.</em>, 516 U. S., at 496\xe2\x80\x93497.  It is the kind of lawsuit that, before the merger of law and equity, respondents could have brought only in a court of equity, not a court of law.  4 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Trusts \xc2\xa724.1, p. 1654 (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott &amp; Ascher) (\xe2\x80\x9cTrusts are, and always have been, the bailiwick of the courts of equity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Duvall</em> v. <em>Craig</em>, 2 Wheat. 45, 56 (1817) (a trustee was \xe2\x80\x9conly suable in equity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the exception of the relief now provided by \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7198(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (1957) (hereinafter Second Restatement); 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \xc2\xa724.2.1, the remedies available to those courts of equity were traditionally considered equitable remedies, see Second Restatement \xc2\xa7199; J.

And other relief ordered by the District Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.  That is because equity chancellors developed a host of other \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctively equitable\xe2\x80\x9d remedies\xe2\x80\x94remedies that were \xe2\x80\x9cfitted to the nature of the primary right\xe2\x80\x9d they were intended to protect.  1 S. Symons, Pomeroy\xe2\x80\x99s Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7108, pp. 139\xe2\x80\x93140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter Pomeroy).  See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter Story).  Indeed, a maxim of equity states that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]quity suffers not a right to be without a remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Francis, Maxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823).  And the relief entered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive relief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, what the District Court did here may be regarded as the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to remedy the false or misleading information CIGNA provided.  The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with the power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional power of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used to prevent fraud.  See <em>Baltzer</em> v. <em>Raleigh &amp; Augusta R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/115/634/index.html">115 U. S. 634</a>, 645 (1885) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is well settled that equity would reform the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if the mistake or fraud were shown\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hearne</em> v. <em>Marine Ins. Co.</em>, 20 Wall. 488, 490 (1874) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe reformation of written contracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of equity jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bradford</em> v. <em>Union Bank of Tenn.</em>, 13 How. 57, 66 (1852); J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7306, p. 618 (1901) (hereinafter Eaton) (courts of common law could only void or enforce, but not reform, a contract); 4 Pomeroy \xc2\xa71375, at 1000 (reformation \xe2\x80\x9cchiefly occasioned by fraud or mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d which were themselves concerns of equity courts); 1 Story \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7152\xe2\x80\x93154; see also 4 Pomeroy \xc2\xa71375, at 999 (equity often considered refor-mation a \xe2\x80\x9cpreparatory step\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes the real contract\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedy essentially held CIGNA to what it had promised, namely, that the new plan would not take from its employees benefits they had already accrued.  This aspect of the remedy resembles estoppel, a traditional equitable remedy.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, E. Merwin, Principles of Equity and Equity Pleading \xc2\xa7910 (H. Merwin ed. 1895); 3 Pomeroy \xc2\xa7804.  Equitable estoppel \xe2\x80\x9coperates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the same position he would have been in had the representations been true.\xe2\x80\x9d  Eaton \xc2\xa762, at 176.  And, as Justice Story long ago pointed out, equitable estoppel \xe2\x80\x9cforms a very essential element in \xe2\x80\xa6 fair dealing, and rebuke of all fraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of courts of equity constantly to promote.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Story \xc2\xa71533, at 776.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan administrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries money owed them under the plan as reformed.  But the fact that this relief takes the form of a money payment does not remove it from the category of traditionally equitable relief.  Equity courts possessed the power to provide relief in the form of monetary \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d for a loss resulting from a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s unjust enrichment.  Restatement (Third) of Trusts \xc2\xa795, and Comment <em>a</em> (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2, 2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7211\xe2\x80\x93212, at 440.  Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this kind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes called a \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge,\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/305/456/index.html">305 U. S. 456</a>, 464 (1939); Third Restatement \xc2\xa795, and Comment <em>a;</em> G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \xc2\xa7862<em> </em>(rev. 2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Bogert); 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa724.2, 24.9, at 1659\xe2\x80\x931660, 1686; Second Restatement \xc2\xa7197; see also <em>Manhattan Bank of Memphis </em>v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/130/267/index.html">130 U. S. 267</a>, 271 (1889) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe suit is plainly one of equitable cognizance, the bill being filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a breach of trust\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 J. Perry, A Treatise on the Law of Trusts and Trustees \xc2\xa717, p. 13 (2d ed. 1874) (common-law attempts \xe2\x80\x9cto punish trustees for a breach of trust in damages, \xe2\x80\xa6 w[ere] soon abandoned\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a duty imposed upon that fiduciary.  See Second Restatement \xc2\xa7201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy \xc2\xa71079; 2 Story \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71261, 1268.  Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is concerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike the defendant in <em>Mertens, </em>is analogous to a trustee makes a critical difference.  See 508 U. S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.  In sum, contrary to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s fears, the types of remedies the court entered here fall within the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the District Court.  We cannot know with certainty which remedy the District Court understood itself to be imposing, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate to exercise its discretion under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) to impose that remedy on remand.  We need not decide which remedies are appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in determining whether members of the relevant employee class were injured.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set forth any particular standard for determining harm.  They simply require the plan administrator to write and to distribute written notices that are \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise\xe2\x80\x9d plan participants and beneficiaries of \xe2\x80\x9ctheir rights and obligations under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7102(a); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7104(b), 204(h).  Nor can we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision, \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to redress ERISA \xe2\x80\x9cviolations\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence any requirement of harm must come from the law of \nequity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking to the law of equity, there is no general principle that \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental reliance\xe2\x80\x9d must be proved before a remedy is decreed.  To the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes such a requirement.  Thus, as CIGNA points out, when equity courts used the remedy of <em>estoppel</em>, they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental reliance, <em>i.e.</em>, that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statement \xe2\x80\x9cin truth, influenced the conduct of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiff, causing \xe2\x80\x9cprejudic[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  Eaton \xc2\xa761, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy \xc2\xa7805.  Accordingly, when a court exercises its authority under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental reliance must be made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this showing is not always necessary for other equitable remedies.  Equity courts, for example, would reform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of the contracting parties where \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent suppression[s], omission[s], or insertion[s],\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Story \xc2\xa7154, at 149, \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial[ly] \xe2\x80\xa6 affect[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d of the contract, even if the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining part[y]\xe2\x80\x9d was negligent in not realizing its mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a standard of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable prudence\xe2\x80\x9d and violate a legal duty.  3 Pomeroy \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7856, 856b, at 334, 340\xe2\x80\x93341; see <em>Baltzer</em>, 115 U. S., at 645;<em> </em>Eaton \xc2\xa7307(b).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimental reliance in cases where they ordered \xe2\x80\x9csurcharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s breach of trust.  In such instances equity courts would \xe2\x80\x9cmold the relief to protect the rights of the beneficiary according to the situation involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bogert \xc2\xa7861, at 4.  This flexible approach belies a strict requirement of \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental reliance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge a trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott &amp; Ascher \xc2\xa724.9, \na fiduciary can be surcharged under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) only upon a showing of actual harm\xe2\x80\x94proved (under the default rule for civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence.  That actual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reliance, but it might also come from the loss of a right protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents.  In the present case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information, in violation of the statute, injured employees even if they did not themselves act in reliance on summary documents\xe2\x80\x94which they might not themselves have seen\xe2\x80\x94for they may have thought fellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would have let them know if, say, plan changes would likely prove harmful.  We doubt that Congress would have wanted to bar those employees from relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a limited extent.  We believe that, to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured him or her.  But to do so, he or she need only show harm and causation.  Although it is not always necessary to meet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental reliance,\xe2\x80\x9d actual harm must be shown.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not asked to reassess the evidence.  And we are not asked about the other prerequisites for relief.  We are asked about the standard of prejudice.  And we conclude that the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from equitable principles, as modified by the obligations and injuries identified by ERISA itself.  Information-related circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too various in nature to insist that harm must always meet that more vigorous \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental harm\xe2\x80\x9d standard when equity imposed no such strict requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have premised our discussion in Part III on the need for the District Court to revisit its determination of an appropriate remedy for the violations of ERISA it identified.  Whether or not the general principles we have discussed above are properly applicable in this case is for it or the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance.  Because the District Court has not determined if an appropriate remedy may be imposed under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), we must vacate the judgment below and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</font></font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n</font></font></font></font></div><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963527">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nCIGNA CORP.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for misrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD).  I do not join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion because I see no need and no justification for saying anything more than that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action \xe2\x80\x9cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  ERISA defines the word \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan which is both,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U.

An SPD, in contrast, is a disclosure meant \xe2\x80\x9cto reasonably apprise [plan] participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71022(a). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be peculiar for a doc-ument meant to \xe2\x80\x9capprise\xe2\x80\x9d participants of their rights \xe2\x80\x9c<em>under the plan</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to be itself part of the \xe2\x80\x9cplan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Any doubt that it is not is eliminated by ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s repeated differentiation of SPDs from the \xe2\x80\x9cwritten instruments\xe2\x80\x9d that constitute a plan, see, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s assignment to different entities of responsibility for drafting and amending SPDs on the one hand and plans on the other, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III), 1024(b)(1); <em>Beck</em> v. <em>PACE Int\xe2\x80\x99l Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/96/index.html">551 U. S. 96</a>, 101 (2007).  An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its purpose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan if it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor omissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.  The District Court based the relief it awarded upon\nERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone.  It thought that the \xe2\x80\x9cbenefits\xe2\x80\x9d due \xe2\x80\x9cunder the terms of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either because the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable of somehow modifying the plan.  Under either justification, that conclusion is wrong.  An SPD is separate from a plan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so provides.  See <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp.</em> v. <em>Schoonejongen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/73/index.html">514 U. S. 73</a>, 79, 85 (1995).  I would go no further.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, ventures on to address a different question: whether respondents may recover under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain other appropriate equitable relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3).  The District Court expressly declined<em> </em>to answer this question, stating that it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not consider whether any relief ordered under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) would also be available under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).\xe2\x80\x9d  559 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 192, 205 (Conn. 2008).  It did note that \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) might not help respondents because that provision authorizes only relief that was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>typically</em> available in equity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Knudson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/204/index.html">534 U. S. 204</a>, 210 (2002)).  But it described this question as \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d 559 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 205, and said that \xe2\x80\x9cin view of these knotty issues \xe2\x80\xa6 the Court need not, and does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues that a lower court \xe2\x80\x9cneed not, and does not, decide,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U.

I find no such implication whatever\xe2\x80\x94not even a weak one.  The District Court simply said that \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) provided relief, and that under our cases \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) might not do so.  While some Members of this Court have sought to divine what legislators would have prescribed beyond what they did prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought to guess what district judges would have decided beyond what they did decide.  And this, bear in mind, is not just a guess as to what the District Court would have done if it had known that its \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today hold) improper.  The apparent answer to that is that it would have denied relief, since it thought itself constrained by \xe2\x80\x9ccertain cases from this Court that [have] narrowed [\xc2\xa7502(a)(3)],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 16.  No, the course the Court guesses about is what the District Court would have done if it had known <em>both </em>that \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) denies relief <em>and </em>that \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) provides it.  This speculation upon speculation hardly renders our discussion of \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) relevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond me.  It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to\ndemonstrate\xe2\x80\x94by blatant dictum, if necessary\xe2\x80\x94that, by George, plan members misled by an SPD will be compensated.  That they will normally be compensated is not in doubt.  As the opinion for the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 10, the Second Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the invalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper notice, by reason of \xc2\xa7204(h), which reads:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAn applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71054(h)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis provision appears a natural fit to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim, which is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its plan, but that CIGNA \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to give them proper notice of changes to their benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  It was inapplicable here only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the manner in which respondents chose to argue the case.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than attempting to read the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s palm, I would simply remand.  If the District Court dismisses the case based on an incorrect reading of <em>Mertens</em>, the Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second Circuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the relief available under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) and <em>Mertens</em> is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor the District Court.  The District Court need not read any of it\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we may very well reverse.  Even if we adhere to our dicta that contract reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98distinctively equitable\xe2\x80\x99 remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, it is far from clear that they are available remedies in this case.  The opinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that they are and disclaims the implication, see <em>ante</em>, at 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering the terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement of the parties \xe2\x80\x9cowing to the fraud of one of the parties and mistake of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  27 Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa769:55, p.\xc2\xa0160 (4th ed. 2010).  But here, the Court would be employing that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in response to a third party\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations\xe2\x80\x94not those of a party to the contract.  The SPD is not part of the ERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor.  Although in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the SPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when writing the plan, and as administrator when preparing the SPD.  ERISA \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully distinguishes these roles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15; see also <em>Beck</em>, 551 U. S., at 101, and nothing the Court cites suggests that they blend together when performed by the same entity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third party was an agent of a contracting party and its misrepresentations could thus be attributed to it under agency law.  But such a relationship has not been alleged and is unlikely here.  An ERISA administrator\xe2\x80\x99s duty to provide employees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the sponsor.  The administrator is a legally distinct entity.  Moreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as agent and the sponsor as principal.  Were this the case, and were the administrator contracting with employees as an agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the SPD would be part of the plan or would amend it\xe2\x80\x94exactly what the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished months after an employee accepts a pension or benefit plan.  \xc2\xa71024(b)(1).  Reformation is meant to effectuate mutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is not retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better suited to the facts of this case.  CIGNA admits that respondents might be able to recover under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) pursuant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably makes this concession only because questions of reliance would be individualized and potentially inappropriate for class-action treatment.  Surcharge (which CIGNA does not concede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same problem.  The amount for which an administrator may\nbe surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the \xe2\x80\x9cactual harm\xe2\x80\x9d suffered by an employee, <em>ante</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x94that is, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost opportunity to contest or react to the switch.  Cf. 3 A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts \xc2\xa7205, pp. 237\xe2\x80\x93243 (4th ed. 1988).  A remedy relating only to that harm would of course be far different from what the District Court imposed.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>I agree with the Court that an SPD is not part of\nan ERISA plan, and that, as a result, a plan participant\nor beneficiary may not recover for misrepresentations in an SPD under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Because this is the only question properly presented for our review, and the only question briefed and argued before us, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[P]lan reformation\xe2\x80\x9d makes an appearance in one sentence of one footnote of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 30, n.\xc2\xa09.

If the new plan were invalidated because of a defective \xc2\xa7204(h) notice, the freeze would return to force, and respondents would be worse off.  Respondents might (and likely should) have argued that the notice for the freeze was itself void, but they \xe2\x80\x9cargued none of these things,\xe2\x80\x9d and the District Court declined to \xe2\x80\x9cmake these arguments now on [their] behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d  559 F.

This question, however, like the Court\xe2\x80\x99s entire discussion of \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), is best left for a case in which the issue is raised and briefed.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></div><font super="1">\n</font></font></font></font></font></div>'
