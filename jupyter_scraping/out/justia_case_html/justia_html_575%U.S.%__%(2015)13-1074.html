June failed to present her FTCA claim to a federal agency within 2 years, but argued that her untimely filing should be excused because the Government had, in her view, concealed facts vital to her claim.  In each case, the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim for failure to satisfy \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s time bars, holding that, despite any justification for delay, those time bars are jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.

There, the Court adopted a \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable presumption\xe2\x80\x9d that such time bars may be equitably tolled.  <i>Id.</i>, at 95.  <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption may, of course, be rebutted.  One way to do so\xe2\x80\x94pursued by the Government here\xe2\x80\x94is to demonstrate that the statute of limitations at issue is jurisdictional; if so, the statute cannot be equitably tolled.  But this Court will not conclude that a time bar is jurisdictional unless Congress provides a \xe2\x80\x9cclear statement\xe2\x80\x9d to that effect.  <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  And in applying that clear statement rule, this Court has said that most time bars, even if mandatory and emphatic, are nonjurisdictional.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___.  Congress thus must do something special to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        (b) Congress did no such thing in enacting \xc2\xa72401(b).  The text of that provision speaks only to a claim\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness; it does not refer to the jurisdiction of the district courts or address those courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to hear untimely suits.  See <i>Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500\n.  Instead, it \xe2\x80\x9creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631\n.  Statutory context confirms that reading.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant often indicates that the deadline is not jurisdictional, and here the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant appears not in \xc2\xa72401(b) but in another section of Title 28, \xc2\xa71346(b)(1).  That jurisdictional grant is not expressly conditioned on compliance with \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations periods.  Finally, assuming it could provide the clear statement that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases require, \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history does not clearly demonstrate that Congress intended the provision to impose a jurisdictional bar.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        (c) The Government\xe2\x80\x99s two principal arguments for treating \xc2\xa72401(b) as jurisdictional are unpersuasive and foreclosed by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        \n            \n        (1) The Government first points out that \xc2\xa72401(b) includes the same \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d language as the statute of limitations governing Tucker Act claims, which this Court has held to be jurisdictional.  See<i>, e.g.</i>, <i>Kendall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n107 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123\n\xe2\x80\x93126.  But that phrase was a commonplace in statutes of limitations enacted around the time of the FTCA, and it does not carry talismanic jurisdictional significance.  Indeed, this Court has construed the same language to be subject to tolling in the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  See <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538\n.  And in two decisions addressing the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, the Court has dismissed the idea that that language is jurisdictionally significant.  See <i>Irwin</i>, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95; <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130\n.  The \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d phrase is thus nothing more than an ordinary way to set a statutory deadline.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        \n            \n        (2) The Government next argues that \xc2\xa72401(b) is jurisdictional because it is a condition on the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity.  But that argument is foreclosed by <i>Irwin</i>, which considered an identical objection but<i> </i>concluded that even time limits that condition a waiver of immunity may be equitably tolled.  See 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of sovereign immunity principles is also peculiarly inapt here.  Unlike other waivers of sovereign immunity, the FTCA treats the Government much like a private party, and the Court has accordingly declined to construe the Act narrowly merely because it waives the Government\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from suit.  There is no reason to do differently here.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">No. 13-1074, 732 F.\xc2\xa03d 1030, and No. 13-1075, 550 Fed.

In each of the two cases we resolve here, the claimant missed one of those deadlines, but requested equitable tolling on the ground that she had a good reason for filing late.  The Government responded that \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s time limits are not subject to tolling because they are jurisdictional restrictions.  Today, we reject the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument and conclude that courts may toll both of the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations periods.</p><p>I</p><p>                    In the first case, respondent Kwai Fun Wong asserts that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) falsely imprisoned her for five days in 1999.<b> </b> As the FTCA requires, Wong first presented that claim to the INS within two years of the alleged unlawful action.  See \xc2\xa72401(b); \xc2\xa72675(a).  The INS denied the administrative complaint on December 3, 2001.  Under the Act, that gave Wong six months, until June 3, 2002, to bring her tort claim in federal court.  See \xc2\xa72401(b).</p><p>                    Several months prior to the INS\xe2\x80\x99s decision, Wong had filed suit in federal district court asserting various <i>non</i>-FTCA claims against the Government arising out of the same alleged misconduct.  Anticipating the INS\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, Wong moved in mid-November 2001 to amend the complaint in that suit by adding her tort claim.  On April 5, 2002, a Magistrate Judge recommended granting Wong leave to amend.  But the District Court did not finally adopt that proposal until June 25\xe2\x80\x94three weeks <i>after</i> the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s 6-month deadline.</p><p>                    The Government moved to dismiss the tort claim on the ground that it was filed late.  The District Court at first rejected the motion.  It recognized that Wong had managed to add her FTCA claim only after \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-month time period had expired.  But the court equitably tolled that period for all the time between the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation and its own order allowing amendment, thus bringing Wong\xe2\x80\x99s FTCA claim within the statutory deadline.  Several years later, the Government moved for reconsideration of that ruling based on an intervening Ninth Circuit decision.  This time, the District Court dismissed Wong\xe2\x80\x99s claim, reasoning that \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 6-month time bar was jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc to address an intra-circuit conflict on the issue.  The en banc court held that the 6-month limit is not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling is available.  <i>Kwai Fun Wong</i> v. <i>Beebe</i>, 732 F.\xc2\xa03d 1030 (2013).  It then confirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior ruling that the circumstances here justify tolling because Wong \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[ed] due diligence\xe2\x80\x9d in attempting to amend her complaint before the statutory deadline.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1052.</p><p>                    The second case before us arises from a deadly highway accident.  Andrew Booth was killed in 2005 when a car in which he was riding<b> </b>crossed through a cable median barrier and crashed into oncoming traffic.  The following year, respondent Marlene June, acting on behalf of Booth\xe2\x80\x99s young son, filed a wrongful death action alleging that the State of Arizona and its contractor had negligently constructed and maintained the median barrier.  Years into that state-court litigation, June contends,<b> </b>she discovered that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had approved installation of the barrier knowing it had not been properly crash tested.</p><p>                    Relying on that new information, June presented a tort claim to the FHWA in 2010, more than five years after the accident.  The FHWA denied the claim, and June promptly filed this action in federal district court.  The court dismissed the suit because June had failed to submit her claim to the FHWA within two years of the collision.  The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s 2-year bar,<b> </b>the court ruled, is jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling; accordingly, the court did not consider June\xe2\x80\x99s contention that tolling was proper because the Government had concealed its failure to require crash testing.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed in light of its recent decision in <i>Wong</i>, thus holding<b> </b>that \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 2-year deadline, like its 6-month counterpart, is not jurisdictional and may be tolled.  550 Fed. Appx. 505 (2013).</p><p>                    We granted certiorari in both cases, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), to resolve a circuit split about whether courts may equitably toll \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s two time limits.  Compare, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> In re FEMA Trailer Formaldehyde Prods. Liability Litigation</i>, 646 F. 3d 185, 190\xe2\x80\x93191 (CA5 2011) (<i>per curiam</i>) (tolling not available), with <i>Arteaga </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 711 F.\xc2\xa03d 828, 832\xe2\x80\x93833 (CA7 2013) (tolling allowed).[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  We now affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rulings.</p><p>II</p><p> <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>,498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89,95 (1990), sets out the framework for deciding \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Irwin</i>, we recognized that time bars in suits between <i>private</i> parties are presumptively subject to equitable tolling.  See <i>id.</i>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396<i>.</i>  That means a court usually may pause the running of a limitations statute in private litigation when a party \xe2\x80\x9chas pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d prevents him from meeting a deadline.  <i>Lozano</i> v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>,572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7).  We held in <i>Irwin </i>that \xe2\x80\x9cthe same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x9d should also apply to suits brought against the United States under a statute waiving sovereign immunity.  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  Our old \xe2\x80\x9cad\xc2\xa0hoc,\xe2\x80\x9d law-by-law approach to determining the availability of tolling in those suits, we reasoned, had produced inconsistency and \xe2\x80\x9cunpredictability\xe2\x80\x9d without the offsetting virtue of enhanced \xe2\x80\x9cfidelity to the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 95.  Adopting the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d used in private litigation, we stated, would \xe2\x80\x9camount[\xc2\xa0] to little, if any, broadening\xe2\x80\x9d of a statutory waiver of immunity.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accordingly, we thought such a presumption \xe2\x80\x9clikely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful\xe2\x80\x9d rule of interpretation.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p><p>                    A rebuttable presumption, of course, may be rebutted, so <i>Irwin </i>does not end the matter.  When enacting a time bar for a suit against the Government (as for one against a private party), Congress may reverse the usual rule if it chooses.  See <i>id.</i>, at 96.  The Government may therefore attempt to establish, through evidence relating to a particular statute of limitations, that Congress opted to forbid equitable tolling.</p><p>                    One way to meet that burden\xe2\x80\x94and the way the Government pursues here\xe2\x80\x94is to show that Congress made the time bar at issue jurisdictional.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  When that is so, a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the bar deprives a court of all authority to hear a case.  Hence, a court must enforce the limitation even if the other party has waived any timeliness objection.  See <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  And, more crucially here, a court must do so even if equitable considerations would support extending the prescribed time period.  See <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130\xe2\x80\x93134 (2008).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>                    Given those harsh consequences, the Government must clear a high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is jurisdictional.  In recent years, we have repeatedly held that procedural rules, including time bars, cabin a court\xe2\x80\x99s power only if Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cclearly state[d]\xe2\x80\x9d as much.<b> </b> <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (quoting <i>Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.</i>,546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500,515 (2006)); see <i>Gonzalez</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]bsent such a clear statement, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Auburn Regional</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937) (quoting <i>Arbaugh</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 516).

But traditional tools of statutory construction must plainly show that Congress imbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences.</p><p>                    And in applying that clear statement rule, we have made plain that most time bars are nonjurisdictional.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 8) (noting the rarity of jurisdictional time limits).  Time and again, we have described filing deadlines as \xe2\x80\x9cquintessential claim-processing rules,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cseek to promote the orderly progress of litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d but do not deprive a court of authority to hear a case.  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Shinseki</i>,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428,435 (2011); see <i>Auburn Regional</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); <i>Scarborough </i>v. <i>Principi</i>,541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 401,413 (2004).  That is so, contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <i>post, </i>at 4, 10\xe2\x80\x9311, even when the time limit is important (most are) and even when it is framed in mandatory terms (again, most are); indeed, that is so \xe2\x80\x9chowever emphatic[ally]\xe2\x80\x9d expressed those terms may be, <i>Henderson</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439 (quoting <i>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co. </i>v. <i>Locomotive Engineers</i>,558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 67,81 (2009)).  Congress must do something special, beyond setting an exception-free deadline, to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it.</p><p>                     In enacting the FTCA, Congress did nothing of that kind.  It provided no clear statement indicating that \xc2\xa72401(b) is the rare statute of limitations that can deprive a court of jurisdiction.  Neither the text nor the context nor the legislative history indicates (much less does so plainly) that Congress meant to enact something other than a standard time bar.</p><p>                    Most important, \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text speaks only to a claim\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness, not to a court\xe2\x80\x99s power.  It states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented [to the agency] within two years .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or unless action is begun within six months\xe2\x80\x9d of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the claim.  That is mundane statute-of-limitations language, saying only what every time bar,by definition, must: that after a certain time a claimis barred.  See <i>infra</i>, at 11, n. 7 (citing many similarly worded limitations statutes).  The language is mandatory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be barred\xe2\x80\x94but (as just noted) that is true of most such statutes, and we have consistently found it of no consequence.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gonzalez</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311).  Too, the language might be viewed as emphatic\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cforever\xe2\x80\x9d barred\xe2\x80\x94but (again) we have often held that not to matter.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Henderson</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439; <i>Union Pacific</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 81.  What matters instead is that \xc2\xa72401(b) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arbaugh</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 515 (quoting <i>Zipes</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</i>,455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,394 (1982)).  It does not define a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over tort claims generally, address its authority to hear untimely suits, or in any way cabin its usual equitable powers.  Section 2401(b), in short, \xe2\x80\x9creads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d spelling out a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s filing obligations without restricting a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  <i>Holland </i>v. <i>Flor-ida</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631,647 (2010).[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>                    Statutory context confirms that reading.  This Court has often explained that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the time bar is not jurisdictional.  See <i>Henderson</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439\xe2\x80\x93440; <i>Reed Elsevier, Inc.</i> v. <i>Muchnick</i>,559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154\xe2\x80\x93165 (2010); <i>Arbaugh</i>, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 515; <i>Zipes</i>, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393\xe2\x80\x93394.  So too here.  Whereas \xc2\xa72401(b) houses the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s time limitations, a different section of Title 28 confers power on federal district courts to hear FTCA claims.  See \xc2\xa71346(b)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cdistrict courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall have exclusive jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over tort claims against the United States).  Nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the limitations periods, or otherwise links those separate provisions.  Treating \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s time bars as jurisdictional would thus disregard the structural divide built into the statute.</p><p>                    Finally, even assuming legislative history alone could provide a clear statement (which we doubt), none does so here.  The report accompanying the FTCA did not discuss whether \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s time limits are jurisdictional.  See S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946).  And in amending \xc2\xa72401(b) four times after its enactment, Congress declined again (four times over) to say anything specific about whether the statute of limitations imposes a jurisdictional bar.  Congress thus failed to provide anything like the clear statement this Court has demanded before deeming a statute of limitations to curtail a court\xe2\x80\x99s power.</p><p>                    And so we wind up back where we started, with <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that equitable tolling is available in suits against the Government.  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95.  The justification the Government offers for departing from that principle fails: Section 2401(b) is not a jurisdictional requirement.<b> </b> The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits, nothing more.  Even though they govern litigation against the Government, a court can toll them on equitable grounds.</p><p>III</p><p>                    The Government balks at that straightforward analysis, claiming that it overlooks two reasons for thinking \xc2\xa72401(b) jurisdictional.  But neither of those reasons is persuasive.  Indeed, our precedents in this area foreclose them both.</p><p>A</p><p>                    The Government principally contends that \xc2\xa72401(b) is jurisdictional because it includes the same language as the statute of limitations governing contract (and some other non-tort) suits brought against the United States under the Tucker Act.  See \xc2\xa72501.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  That statute long provided that such suits \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d if not filed within six years.  Act of Mar. 3, 1863, \xc2\xa710,12Stat.767; see Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \xc2\xa7156,36Stat.1139.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  And this Court repeatedly held that 6-year limit to be jurisdictional and thus not subject to equitable tolling.  See <i>Kendall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,107 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123\xe2\x80\x93126 (1883); <i>Finn</i> v. <i>United States</i>,123 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227,232 (1887); <i>Soriano</i> v. <i>United States</i>,352 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270\xe2\x80\x93274 (1957).  When Congress drafted the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, it used the same \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d language (though selecting a shorter limitations period).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn these circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s identically worded time limit to be a jurisdictional bar.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in <i>Wong </i>21\xe2\x80\x9322.  According to the Government, Congress wanted the FTCA to serve as \xe2\x80\x9ca tort-law analogue to the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x9d and incorporated the words \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d to similarly preclude equitable tolling.  Reply Brief in <i>Wong </i>4.  (The dissent relies heavily on the same argument.  See <i>post</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x938.)</p><p>                    But the Government takes too much from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use in \xc2\xa72401(b) of an utterly unremarkable phrase.  The \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d formulation was a commonplace in federal limitations statutes for many decades surrounding Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of the FTCA.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  And neither this Court nor any other has accorded those words talismanic power to render time bars jurisdictional.  To the contrary, we have construed the very same \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d language in15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715b, the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, to be subject to tolling; nothing in that provision, we found, \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[s] the power of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d to extend a limitations period when circumstances warrant.  <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538,559 (1974);<b> </b>see <i>Hardin</i> v. <i>City Title &amp; Escrow Co.</i>, 797 F.\xc2\xa02d 1037, 1040 (CADC 1986) (calling \xc2\xa715(b) \xe2\x80\x9ca good example of a non-jurisdictional time limitation\xe2\x80\x9d based on its text and separation from the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdic-tional provisions).[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  As the Government itself has previously acknowledged, referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d locution:<b> </b>\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat type of language has more to do with the legal rhetoric at the time the statute was passed\xe2\x80\x9d than with anything else, and should not \xe2\x80\x9cmake[\xc2\xa0] a difference\xe2\x80\x9d to the jurisdictional analysis.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Irwin</i>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1990, No. 89\xe2\x80\x935867, p.\xc2\xa030.  Or, put just a bit differ-ently: Congress\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of a phrase endemic to limitations statutes of that era, at least some of which allow tolling, cannot provide the requisite clear statement that a time bar curtails a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority.</p><p>                    Indeed, in two decisions directly addressing the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, this Court dismissed the idea that the language the Government relies on here has jurisdictional significance.  Twice we described the words in that provision as not meaningfully different from those in a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations.  And twice we made clear that the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar has precious little to do with its phrasing.</p><p>                    We first did so in <i>Irwin</i>.  Using our newly minted presumption,<b> </b>see <i>supra</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, we decided there that the limitations period governing Title VII suits against the Government,42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c) (1988 ed.), allowed equitable tolling.  In reaching that conclusion, we compared \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text (then stating that an employee \xe2\x80\x9cmay file a civil action\xe2\x80\x9d within 30 days of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s denial of her claim)<b> </b>with the language of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar.  We noted that we had formerly held the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitations statute to \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictionally bar[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d late claims, and we acknowledged the possibility of justifying that different treatment by characterizing its \xe2\x80\x9clanguage [as] more stringent than\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c)\xe2\x80\x99s.  <i>Irwin</i>, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94\xe2\x80\x9395.  But we rejected that reasoning, instead finding that the two formulations were materially alike.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are not persuaded,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the difference between them is enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 95.  Leaving for another day the question of what <i>did </i>account for the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, the Court thus ruled out reliance on its language.  In other words, on the core question the Government raises here\xe2\x80\x94whether the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in both the Tucker Act and the FTCA, manifests a congressional decision to preclude tolling\xe2\x80\x94<i>Irwin </i>said no.</p><p>                    More recently, <i>John R. Sand </i>reaffirmed that conclusion, even as it refused to overturn our century-old view that the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar is jurisdictional.  No less than three times, <i>John R. Sand </i>approvingly repeated <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the textual differences between the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar and \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c) were insignificant\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, that the language of the two provisions could not explain why the former was jurisdictional and the latter not.  See 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 137, 139 (calling the provisions \xe2\x80\x9clinguistically similar,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csimilar .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in language,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly worded\xe2\x80\x9d).  But if that were so, <i>John R. Sand </i>asked, why not hold that the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time limit, like \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c), is nonjurisdictional?  The answer came down to two words: <i>stare decisis</i>.  The Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s bar was different because it had been the subject of \xe2\x80\x9ca definitive earlier interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 138; see <i>id.</i>, at 137; <i>supra</i>, at 10.  And for that reason alone, <i>John R. Sand</i> left in place our prior construction of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time limit.  See 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 139 (observing, in Justice Brandeis\xe2\x80\x99s words, that \xe2\x80\x9cit is more important that\xe2\x80\x9d the rule \xe2\x80\x9cbe settled than that it be settled right\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Burnet </i>v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.</i>,285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393,406 (1932) (dissenting opinion))).  What is special about the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s deadline,<i> John R. Sand</i> recognized, comes merely from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior rulings, not from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice of wording.</p><p>                    The Government thus cannot show that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72401(b) plainly signifies a jurisdictional statute, as our decisions require.  See <i>supra</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Unlike in <i>John R. Sand</i>, here <i>stare decisis</i> plays no role: We have not previously considered whether \xc2\xa72401(b) restricts a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  What we have done is to say, again and again, that the core language in that provision has no jurisdictional significance.  It is materi-ally indistinguishable from the language in one nonjurisdic-tional time bar (<i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c)).  See <i>Irwin</i>, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95; <i>John R. Sand</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 137, 139.  And it is identical to the language in another (<i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715b).  See <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 559.  Yes, we have held that the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, which includes those same words, constrains a court\xe2\x80\x99s power to hear late claims.  But as we explained in <i>Irwin</i>,<i> </i>that is not because the phrase itself \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest[s] a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95.  The words on which the Government pins its hopes are just the words of a limitations statute of a particular era.  And nothing else supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Congress, when enacting the FTCA, wanted to incorporate this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time bar\xe2\x80\x94much less that Congress expressed that purported intent with the needed clear statement.</p><p>B</p><p>                    The Government next contends that at the time of the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Congress thought that <i>every</i> limitations statute applying to suits against the United States, however framed or worded, cut off a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over untimely claims.  On that view, the particular language of those statutes makes no difference.  All that matters is that such time limits function as conditions on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity.  In that era\xe2\x80\x94indeed, up until <i>Irwin </i>was decided\xe2\x80\x94those conditions were generally supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly observed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Soriano</i>, 352 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 276.  That meant, the Government urges, that all time limits on actions against the United States \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ied] jurisdictional consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States in <i>Wong </i>34.  Accordingly, the Government concludes, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cwould have expected courts to apply [\xc2\xa72401(b)] as a jurisdictional requirement\xe2\x80\x94just as conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity had always been applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at\xc2\xa032.</p><p> <i>Irwin</i>, however, forecloses that argument.  After all, <i>Irwin </i>also considered a pre-<i>Irwin</i> time bar attached to a waiver of sovereign immunity.  The Government argued there\xe2\x80\x94anticipating its claim here\xe2\x80\x94that because \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c)\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations conditioned such a waiver, it must be jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. <b> </b>See Brief for Respondents 6, 10, 14, 19, and Tr. of Oral Arg.<i> </i>31\xe2\x80\x9337, in<i> Irwin</i>, O. T. 1990, No. 89\xe2\x80\x935867.  But <i>Irwin </i>disagreed, applying the opposite presumption to a time limit passed two decades earlier.  See 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94\xe2\x80\x9396; <i>supra</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Justice White protested, much as the Government does now, that at the time<b> </b>of<b> </b>\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, limitations statutes for suits against the Government were \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly observed\xe2\x80\x9d and not amenable to tolling.  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 97 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting <i>Soriano</i>, 352 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 276); see 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 99, n.\xc2\xa02.  How could an earlier Congress, Justice White asked, have \xe2\x80\x9chad in mind the Court\xe2\x80\x99s present departure from that longstanding rule\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>post</i>, at 9 (asking a variant of the same question).  But the <i>Irwin </i>Court was undeterred.  The Court noted that it had not applied the former rule so consistently as Justice White suggested.  See 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94.  And the Court doubted that the former approach so well reflected congressional intent: On the contrary, because equitable tolling \xe2\x80\x9camounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d we thought that a rule generally <i>allowing </i>tolling is the more \xe2\x80\x9crealistic assessment of legislative intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 95; see <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  For those reasons, the Court declined to count time bars as jurisdictional merely because they condition waivers of immunity\xe2\x80\x94even if Congress enacted the deadline when the Court interpreted limitations statutes differently.</p><p>                    In the years since, this Court has repeatedly followed <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s lead.  We have applied <i>Irwin</i> to pre-<i>Irwin </i>statutes, just as we have to statutes that followed in that decision\xe2\x80\x99s wake.  See <i>Scarborough</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 420\xe2\x80\x93422; <i>Franconia Associates</i> v. <i>United States</i>,536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129,145 (2002).  To be sure, <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>presumption is rebuttable.  But the rebuttal cannot rely on what <i>Irwin </i>itself deemed irrelevant\xe2\x80\x94that Congress passed the statute in an earlier era, when this Court often attached jurisdictional consequence to conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity.  Rather, the rebuttal must identify something distinctive about the time limit at issue, whether enacted then or later\xe2\x80\x94a reason for thinking Congress wanted <i>that </i>limitations statute (not all statutes passed in an earlier day) to curtail a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  On the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view, <i>Irwin </i>would effectively become only a prospective decision.  Nothing could be less consonant with <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s ambition to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule to govern the applicability of equit-able tolling in suits against the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95.</p><p>                    And<b> </b>the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim is peculiarly inapt as applied to \xc2\xa72401(b) because all that is special about the FTCA cuts <i>in favor of</i> allowing equitable tolling.  As compared to other waivers of immunity (prominently including the Tucker Act), the FTCA treats the United States more like a commoner than like the Crown.  The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional provision states that courts may hear suits \xe2\x80\x9cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant.\xe2\x80\x9d28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b).  And when defining substantive liability for torts, the Act reiterates that the United States is accountable \xe2\x80\x9cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72674.  In keeping with those provisions, this Court has often rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s calls to cabin the FTCA on the ground that it waives sovereign immunity\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, the Court did so in the years immediately after the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage, even as it was construing <i>other</i> waivers of immunity narrowly.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> United States</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i>,338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 366,383 (1949); <i>Indian Towing Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,350 U.\xc2\xa0S. 61,65 (1955); <i>Rayonier Inc.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,352 U.\xc2\xa0S. 315\xe2\x80\x93320 (1957).  There is no reason to do differently here.  As <i>Irwin </i>recognized, treating the Government like a private person means (among other things) permitting equitable tolling.  See 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  So in stressing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s equivalence to a private party, the FTCA goes further<i> </i>than the typical statute waiving sovereign immunity to indicate that its time bar allows a court to hear late claims.</p><p>IV</p><p>                    Our precedents make this a clear-cut case.  <i>Irwin </i>requires an affirmative indication from Congress that it intends to preclude equitable tolling in a suit against the Government.  See 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  Congress can provide that signal by making a statute of limitations jurisdictional.  But that requires its own plain statement; otherwise, we treat a time bar as a mere claims-processing rule.  See <i>Auburn Regional</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 8).  Congress has supplied no such statement here.  As this Court has repeatedly stated, nothing about \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s core language is special; \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d is an ordinary (albeit old-fashioned) way of setting a deadline, which does not preclude tolling when circumstances warrant.  See <i>Irwin</i>, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 95\xe2\x80\x9396; <i>John R. Sand</i>, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 137, 139; <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 558\xe2\x80\x93559.

The FTCA waives the immunity of the United States for certain tort claims but provides that any \xe2\x80\x9ctort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless\xe2\x80\x9d it is filed with the appropriate agency \xe2\x80\x9cwithintwo years after such claim accrues\xe2\x80\x9d and in federal court \xe2\x80\x9cwithin six months after\xe2\x80\x9d the agency\xe2\x80\x99s final decision.28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72401(b).  The statutory text, its historical roots, and more than a century of precedents show that this absolute bar is not subject to equitable tolling.  I would enforce the statute as Congress intended and reverse.</p><p>I</p><p>                    The FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity and must be understood in that context.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Congress was reluctant to allow individual tort claims against the United States.  Instead, it granted relief to individuals through private laws enacted solely for those individuals\xe2\x80\x99 benefit.  These waivers of sovereign immunity were surgical and sporadic, but \xe2\x80\x9cnotoriously clumsy,\xe2\x80\x9d and by 1946 Congress thought it better to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9csimplified\xe2\x80\x9d approach.  <i>Dalehite</i> v. <i>United States</i>,346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15\xe2\x80\x9325 (1953).  The FTCA thus waived sovereign immunity for tort claims against the Government and set out a procedure for adjudicating those claims.</p><p>                    This waiver of sovereign immunity was no trivial matter.  Long before the FTCA, Congress authorized suits against the Government for contract and property claims under the Tucker Act and a number of predecessor statutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims from its waiver of sovereign immunity.  The concern was obvious: As opposed to the more predictable nature of contractual and property claims, tort-based harms are sometimes unperceived and open-ended.  Even frivolous claims require the Federal Government to expend administrative and litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon society at-large.  For every dollar spent to defend against or to sat-isfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government must either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated to different public programs.</p><p>                    To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity.  The statute \xe2\x80\x9cexempts from [its] waiver certain categories of claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,218 (2008), and includes a broad exemption for claims \xe2\x80\x9carising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\xe2\x80\x9d28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72680(h); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72680(a)\xe2\x80\x93(n).  In addition, in order to limit the scope and unpredictability of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s potential liability, the Act exempts from the waiver of sovereign immunity certain types of recovery, such as prejudgment interest and punitive damages.  See \xc2\xa72674.</p><p>                    Most relevant here, the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s]\xe2\x80\x9d its waiver of sovereign immunity on strict filing deadlines.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kubrick</i>,444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111,117 (1979).  As enacted in 1946, the Act granted district courts exclusive jurisdiction over tort claims against the Government, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to the [other] provisions of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  FTCA, ch. 753, \xc2\xa7410(a),60Stat.843\xe2\x80\x93844.  One of those provisions stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very claim against the United States cognizable under this title shall be forever barred, unless within one year after such claim accrued .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. it is presented in writing to the [relevant] Federal agency .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an action is begun\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  \xc2\xa7420, <i>id.</i>, at 845.  The current version provides in full as follows:</p><p>                    \xe2\x80\x9cA tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.\xe2\x80\x9d28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72401(b).</p><p>II</p><p>                    The question presented in these two cases is whether the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines are subject to equitable tolling.  We must therefore decide (1) whether the deadlines are \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d in nature, so that courts are without power to adjudicate claims filed outside their strict limits and (2) if they are not jurisdictional, whether the statute nonetheless prohibits equitable tolling.  Both of these inquiries require close attention to the text, context, and history of the Act.  And both lead to the conclusion that the FTCA allows no equitable tolling.</p><p>A</p><p>                    The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines are jurisdictional.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text prohibits adjudication of untimely claims.  Once the Act\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines have run, all untimely claims \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  These words are not qualified or aspirational.  They are absolute.  If not filed with the agency within two years, or with a federal court within six months, a claim \xe2\x80\x9cshall be\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbarred\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfor-ever.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cShall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d is not generally understood to mean \xe2\x80\x9cshould be allowed sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute brooks no exceptions.  And because the filing deadlines restrict the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity, they impose a limit on the courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction that \xe2\x80\x9cwe should not take it upon ourselves to extend.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kubrick</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 117\xe2\x80\x93118.</p><p>                    For over 130 years, we have understood these terms as jurisdictional.  When crafting the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision, Congress did not write on a clean slate.  Rather, it borrowed language from limitations provisions in the Tucker Act and its predecessor statutes.  The 1911 version of the Tucker Act included language that was nearly identical to that in the 1946 version of the FTCA: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery claim against the United States cognizable by the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. within six years after the claim first accrues.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7156,36Stat.1139.  That statutory language came, in turn, from the 1863 predecessor to the Tucker Act.  See \xc2\xa710,12Stat.767.</p><p>                    As early as 1883, we interpreted these precise terms to impose a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction[al]\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9ccourt may not disregard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kendall</i> v. <i>United States</i>,107 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123.  We emphasized that, when waiving sovereign immunity, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmay restrict the jurisdiction of the [courts] to certain classes of demands.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he express words of the statute leave no room for contention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court thus had no \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to engraft\xe2\x80\x9d an equitable tolling provision where Congress had so clearly constrained the judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    Over the ensuing decades, we repeatedly reaffirmed our interpretation of the phrase.  In <i>Finn</i> v. <i>United States</i>,123 U.\xc2\xa0S. 227,232 (1887), we held that the Government could not waive the jurisdictional time bar and thus that the \xe2\x80\x9cduty of the court\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto dismiss the petition\xe2\x80\x9d when a plaintiff raised an untimely claim.  We reached the same conclusion in <i>De Arnaud</i> v. <i>United States</i>,151 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483\xe2\x80\x93496 (1894).  We reaffirmed the rule in <i>United States</i> v. <i>New York</i>,160 U.\xc2\xa0S. 598\xe2\x80\x93619 (1896), while holding that there <i>was</i> jurisdiction where the plaintiff presented its claim before the statutory deadline.  And in <i>Munro</i> v. <i>United States</i>,303 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36, n.\xc2\xa01, 41 (1938), we held that a District Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve un-timely claims, even if the Government waived any objection, under a different statute that incorporated the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s time limits.  All the while, the lower courts similarly enforced the deadline as \xe2\x80\x9ca jurisdictional requirement, compliance with which is necessary to enable suit to be maintained against the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Compagnie Generale Transatlantique</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 51 F.\xc2\xa02d 1053, 1056 (CA2 1931).  Thus, by 1946, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred\xe2\x80\x9d was well understood to deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over untimely claims.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>                    The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory terms must be understood in this context.  When Congress crafted the FTCA as a tort-based analogue to the Tucker Act, it consciously borrowed the well-known wording of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadline.  Then, as now, it was settled that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n adopting the language used in an earlier act, Congress must be considered to have adopted also the construction given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of the enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hecht</i> v. <i>Malley</i>,265 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144,153 (1924); see also <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>United States</i>,335 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,16 (1948); <i>Sekhar</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2013) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 527, 537 (1947))).</p><p>                    Indeed, Congress considered departing from the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on equitable tolling, but decided against it.  Proposals to include an equitable tolling provision were \xe2\x80\x9cincluded in nine of the thirty-one bills prior to the enactment of the FTCA,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe Act passed by the 1946 Congress did not provide for any equitable tolling of the limitations periods.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colella &amp; Bain, Revisiting Equitable Tolling and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 Seton Hall L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 174, 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (2000).  Instead, it was understood that individuals with claims outside those deadlines could turn to Congress for relief through private bills, as they did before the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See <i>id.,</i> at 195.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>                    The evidence of statutory meaning does not end there.  We reaffirmed the phase\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional nature in the decades following the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  In <i>Soriano</i> v. <i>United States</i>,352 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270 (1957), we rejected a request to allow equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.  Confirming the connection between the Tucker Act and the FTCA, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cstatutes permitting suits for tax refunds, <i>tort actions</i>, alien property litigation, patent cases, and other claims against the Government would be affected\xe2\x80\x9d if the Court allowed equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.  <i>Id.</i>, at 275 (emphasis added).  And in <i>Kubrick</i>, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 117\xe2\x80\x93118, we cited <i>Soriano</i>\xe2\x80\x99s warning while emphasizing that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s time limits are a condition of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity.</p><p>                    The lower courts also quickly recognized the statutes\xe2\x80\x99 common heritage and enforced \xc2\xa72401(b) as a jurisdictional requirement.  In<i> Anderegg</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 171 F.\xc2\xa02d 127, 128 (1948) (<i>per curiam</i>), the Fourth Circuit cited <i>Finn</i> and <i>Munro</i> while holding that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadline is a jurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive.  The Fifth Circuit, in<i> Simon</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 244 F.\xc2\xa02d 703, 705, n. 4 (1957), held that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s deadline is a jurisdictional condition on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity and cited <i>Carpenter</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 56 F.\xc2\xa02d 828, 829 (CA2 1932), a Tucker Act case, to support its holding.  And in <i>Humphreys </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 272 F.\xc2\xa02d 411 (1959), the Ninth Circuit similarly relied on Tucker Act precedents to hold that \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court has no jurisdiction over [an untimely FTCA] action,\xe2\x80\x9d because no waiver of sovereign immunity exists once the filing deadline \xe2\x80\x9chas run.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 412 (citing <i>Edwards</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 163 F.\xc2\xa02d 268, 269 (CA9 1947), in turn citing <i>Finn</i> and <i>Munro</i>).  When Congress amended the FTCA in 1966, it readopted the \xe2\x80\x9cforever barred\xe2\x80\x9d language against the backdrop of <i>Soriano</i> and the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the phrase.  We must therefore assume that Congress meant to keep the universally recognized meaning of those words.  See, <i>e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Cline</i>,540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581\xe2\x80\x93594 (2004).</p><p>                    That meaning, of course, cannot change over time.  But even if there were any doubt, we recently reaffirmed our view in <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130 (2008).  We explained that, unlike run-of-the-mill statutes of limitation, jurisdictional time limits \xe2\x80\x9cseek .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as facilitating the administration of claims, limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, or promoting judicial efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 133 (citations omitted).  Recounting our decisions in <i>Kendall</i>, <i>Finn</i>, <i>De Arnaud</i>, <i>New York</i>, and <i>Soriano</i>, we \xe2\x80\x9creiterated\xe2\x80\x9d our understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute nature of the court of claims limitations statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 135.  And we rejected an invitation to abandon that interpretation, noting that Congress has long accepted our interpretation of the statute.  <i>Id.,</i> at 139.</p><p>                    The same must be said of the FTCA.  As we have often explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a long line of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions left undisturbed by Congress has treated a similar requirement as \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x99 we will presume that Congress intended to follow that course.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Shinseki</i>,562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428,436 (2011) (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Reed Elsevier, Inc.</i> v. <i>Muchnick</i>,559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154,168 (2010); <i>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co. </i>v. <i>Locomotive Engineers</i>,558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 67,82 (2009).  Every single decision from this Court interpreting the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csimilar requirement\xe2\x80\x9d has treated it as jurisdictional.  And there is strong historical evidence that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended to follow that course.\xe2\x80\x9d  That should be the end of the matter: Section 2410(b)\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines are jurisdictional limits that are not subject to equitable tolling.</p><p>B</p><p>                    Even if the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s filing deadlines are not jurisdic-tional, they still prohibit equitable tolling.  To be sure, in recent years, we have grown reluctant to affix the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d label.  See, <i>e.g., Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.</i>,546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500,510 (2006); <i>Henderson</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 434\xe2\x80\x93436.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut calling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10).  Where Congress imposes an inflexible claims processing rule, it is our duty to enforce the law and prohibit equitable tolling, whether it is jurisdictional or not.</p><p>                    Here, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent is clear.  The words of the statute leave no doubt that untimely claims are never allowed: They are \xe2\x80\x9c<i>forever</i> barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is no weak-kneed command.  The history underlying the text only bolsters its apparent meaning, and our repeated reaffirmation of the phrase\xe2\x80\x99s meaning should remove any doubt.  Congress never meant for equitable tolling to be available under the FTCA.</p><p>                    The only factor pointing in the opposite direction is our suggestion in <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>,498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89\xe2\x80\x9396 (1990), that we would thenceforth apply a rebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling in suits against the Government.  But it is beyond me how <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s judge-made presumption announced in 1990 can trump the obvious meaning of a statute enacted many decades earlier.  Cf. <i>Cannon</i> v. <i>University of Chicago</i>,441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677,718 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).  In any event, <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption is overcome in this case.  For well over a century, we have recognized the inflexible nature of the Tucker Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision.  Since its adoption, we have recognized that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s language bears the same meaning as its Tucker Act companion.  See <i>Soriano</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 275; <i>Kubrick</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 118.  And in <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel</i>, we held that our \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitive ear-lier interpretation of the\xe2\x80\x9d Tucker Act is a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient rebuttal\xe2\x80\x9d to <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption.  552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 138.  There is no principled way to distinguish this case.  Section 2401(b) allows no equitable tolling.</p><p>III</p><p>                    The Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion is wrong at every step.  In its view, \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory text is \xe2\x80\x9cmundane\xe2\x80\x9d language that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  But \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d nonjurisdictional time limits are typically directed at claimants.  The deadline in <i>Henderson</i>, for example, required that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>a person</i> adversely affected by [a Board of Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Appeals] decision shall file a notice of appeal .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. within 120 days after\xe2\x80\x9d the decision.38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77266(a) (emphasis added); 562 U.\xc2\xa0S, at 438.  The \xe2\x80\x9crun-of-the-mill\xe2\x80\x9d limitations provision in <i>Holland </i>v. <i>Florida</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631,647 (2010), likewise applied to the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d responsible for filing: \xe2\x80\x9cA1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus <i>by a person</i> in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\xe2\x80\x9d28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) (emphasis added); 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 635.  And the provision at issue in <i>Irwin</i> was similar, if not an even weaker command.  It provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of notice of final action taken by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an <i>employee or applicant</i> for employment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. <i>may file</i> a civil action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 94 (quoting42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c) (1998 ed.); emphasis added).</p><p>                    Section 2401(b), by contrast, never mentions the claimant, and it is phrased in emphatically absolute terms.  It says unequivocally that untimely tort claims against the United States \xe2\x80\x9cshall be forever barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although it does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d it speaks at least as much to the courts (who are \xe2\x80\x9cforever barred\xe2\x80\x9d from considering untimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are \xe2\x80\x9cforever barred\xe2\x80\x9d from bringing stale claims).  More important, though, the words in \xc2\xa72401(b) have a well-known meaning that <i>ipse dixit</i> labels cannot overcome.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>                    The majority tells us this \xe2\x80\x9cold \xe2\x80\x98ad\xc2\xa0hoc,\xe2\x80\x99 law-by-law approach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also known as <i>statutory interpretation</i>\xe2\x80\x94has been replaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable tolling and a judicial preference against jurisdictional labels.  <i>Ante, </i>at 4.  I dispute the premise.  But in any event, as I explained above, and as six Members of the current Court held in <i>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel</i>, the overwhelming evidence of congressional intent here easily overtakes <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable presumption.  Even if we would rather not call \xc2\xa72401(b)\xe2\x80\x99s deadlines \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d with all that label entails, we must nonetheless recognize that Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.</p><p>                    The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give it any separate attention.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5, n. 2.  But we cannot conflate the two questions because, though the relevant evidence is the same, the analysis is different.  In particular, the majority is wrong to rely on <i>Irwin</i> when assessing the jurisdictional question, which is the only question it really decides.  We do not indulge <i>Irwin</i>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption when determining whether a requirement is jurisdictional.  Instead, we typically invoke <i>Irwin</i> only <i>after</i> finding that a requirement is not jurisdictional, to decide whether Congress nonetheless intended to prohibit equitable tolling.  In <i>Henderson</i>, for instance, we never mentioned <i>Irwin</i> because the parties did not ask us to address whether the rule was \xe2\x80\x9csubject to equitable tolling if it [was] not jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 442, n.\xc2\xa04.  Likewise, in <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Russell</i>,551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205 (2007), we held that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, without a word about <i>Irwin</i>.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  In <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, (2013) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 11\xe2\x80\x9313), we considered <i>Irwin</i> only after deciding that a deadline was not jurisdictional.  And in <i>Holland</i>, we held that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\xe2\x80\x99s time limits are not jurisdictional, without relying on <i>Irwin</i>, and then stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally subject to a \xe2\x80\x98rebuttable presumption\xe2\x80\x99 in favor \xe2\x80\x98of equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 645\xe2\x80\x93646 (quoting <i>Irwin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 95\xe2\x80\x9396) (emphasis deleted);<i> </i>cf. <i>Young</i> v. <i>United States</i>,535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43\xe2\x80\x9350 (2002) (invoking <i>Irwin</i> after concluding that a limitations period was not a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d component of the Bankruptcy Code).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]                      This error matters because the majority\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional analysis literally begins and ends with <i>Irwin</i>, see <i>ante,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, 18, and thus relies on a presumption that should have no bearing on the question.
