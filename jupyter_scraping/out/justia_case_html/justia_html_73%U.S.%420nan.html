These were delivered to Mrs. Fowler sometime previously to October, 1851.  Mrs. Fowler received interest in three different payments, up to January, 1853, and in March of that year, $500 of the principal.

In that year, he executed another mortgage, or deed of trust, to one Linthicum, dated 20 December, 1854, which was put on record May 4, 1855.

JUSTICE GRIER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We do not consider it necessary to vindicate our opinion in affirming the charge of the court below to enter into a discussion of the law of bailment in general from Coggs and Bernard down to this time, or clearly to define the difference between negligence and gross negligence.  The evidence clearly establishes the fact that the defendant "did diligently and carefully lend and invest the sum of money entrusted to him on good and sufficient security for the repayment thereof."  It is the gravamen of the charge in the plaintiff\'s <em>narr.</em> that he did not do so.</p>\n<p>The mortgage was a sufficient security without being recorded, and continued to be so for three years.  It was in the possession of the plaintiff his wife.  The plaintiff himself had it in his possession near four months before the second mortgage was put on record.  The neglect to put it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 73 U. S. 423</a></p><p> on record may more properly be imputed to himself than to the defendant.</p>\n<p>We are asked to decide that the gentleman who did Mrs. Fowler the kindness to make the investment for her should have anticipated her negligence, and that also of her husband, and have anticipated the insolvency also of the mortgagor, and that he has been guilty of negligence, either simple or gross, which should make him liable in the present action.</p>\n<p>We do not take this view of the case, and find no error in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE did not sit in this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
