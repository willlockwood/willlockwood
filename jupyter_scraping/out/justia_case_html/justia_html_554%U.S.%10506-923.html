The plan gives MetLife (as administrator) discretionary authority to determine the validity of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s benefits claim and provides that MetLife (as insurer) will pay the claims.  Respondent Wanda Glenn, a Sears employee, was granted an initial 24 months of benefits under the plan following a diagnosis of a heart disorder.  MetLife encouraged her to apply for, and she began receiving, Social Security disability benefits based on an agency determination that she could do no work.  But when MetLife itself had to determine whether she could work, in order to establish eligibility for extended plan benefits, it found her capable of doing sedentary work and denied her the benefits.  Glenn sought federal-court review under ERISA, see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B), but the District Court denied relief.  In reversing, the Sixth Circuit used a deferential standard of review and considered it a conflict of interest that MetLife both determined an employee\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for benefits and paid the benefits out of its own pocket.  Based on a combination of this conflict and other circumstances, it set aside MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s benefits denial. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a><em>, </em>sets out four principles as to the appropriate standard of judicial review under \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B): (1) A court should be \xe2\x80\x9cguided by principles of trust law,\xe2\x80\x9d analogizing a plan administrator to a trustee and considering a benefit determination a fiduciary act, <em>id.,</em> at 111\xe2\x80\x93113; (2) trust law principles require <em>de novo </em>review unless a benefits plan provides otherwise, <em>id., </em>at 115; (3) where the plan so provides, by granting \xe2\x80\x9cthe administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca deferential standard of review [is] appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 111, 115; and (4) if the administrator or fiduciary having discretion \xe2\x80\x9cis operating<em> </em>under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a \xe2\x80\x98facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 115.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0A plan administrator\xe2\x80\x99s dual role of both evaluating and paying benefits claims creates the kind of conflict of interest referred to in <em>Firestone</em>.  That conclusion is clear where it is the employer itself that both funds the plan and evaluates the claim, but a conflict also exists where, as here, the plan administrator is an insurance company.  For one thing, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s own conflict may extend to its selection of an insurance company to administer its plan.  For another, ERISA imposes higher-than-marketplace quality standards on insurers, requiring a plan administrator to \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge [its] duties\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to discretionary claims processing \xe2\x80\x9csolely in the interests of the [plan\xe2\x80\x99s] participants and beneficiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71104(a)(1); underscoring the particular importance of accurate claims processing by insisting that administrators \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a \xe2\x80\x98full and fair review\xe2\x80\x99 of claim denials,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 113; and supplementing marketplace and regulatory controls with judicial review of individual claim denials, see \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  Finally, a legal rule that treats insurers and employers alike in respect to the <em>existence </em>of a conflict can nonetheless take account of different circumstances by treating the circumstances as diminishing the conflict\xe2\x80\x99s <em>significance </em>or <em>severity</em> in individual cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The significance of the conflict of interest factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.  <em>Firestone\xe2\x80\x99s </em>\xe2\x80\x9cweighed as a \xe2\x80\x98factor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d language, 489 U. S., at 115, does not imply a change in the <em>standard </em>of review, say, from deferential to <em>de novo. </em> Nor should this Court overturn <em>Firestone </em>by adopting a rule that could bring about near universal <em>de novo </em>review of most ERISA plan claims denials.  And it is not necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payor conflict.  <em>Firestone </em>means what the word \xe2\x80\x9cfactor\xe2\x80\x9d implies, namely, that judges reviewing a benefit denial\xe2\x80\x99s lawfulness may take account of several different considerations, conflict of interest being one.  This kind of review is no stranger to the judicial system.  Both trust law and administrative law ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.  Any one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the others are closely balanced.  Here, the Sixth Circuit gave the conflict some weight, but focused more heavily on other factors: that MetLife had encouraged Glenn to argue to the Social Security Administration that she could do no work, received the bulk of the benefits of her success in doing so (being entitled to receive an offset from her retroactive Social Security award), and then ignored the agency\xe2\x80\x99s finding in concluding that she could do sedentary work; and that MetLife had emphasized one medical report favoring denial of benefits, had deemphasized other reports suggesting a contrary conclusion, and had failed to provide its independent vocational and medical experts with all of the relevant evidence.  These serious concerns, taken together with some degree of conflicting interests on MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s part, led the court to set aside MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decision.  There is nothing improper in the way this review was conducted.  Finally, the <em>Firestone</em> standard\xe2\x80\x99s elucidation does not consist of detailed instructions, because there \xe2\x80\x9care no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Universal Camera Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/index.html">340 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 <em>et seq.</em>; see \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  Often the entity that administers the plan, such as an employer or an insurance company, both determines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket.  We here decide that this dual role creates a conflict of interest; that a reviewing court should consider that conflict as a factor in determining whether the plan administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits; and that the significance of the factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.  See <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/101/index.html">489 U.

See App. 182a\xe2\x80\x93183a; 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71003.  The plan grants MetLife (as administrator) discretionary authority to determine whether an employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim for benefits is valid; it simultaneously provides that MetLife (as insurer) will itself pay valid benefit claims.  App. 181a\xe2\x80\x93182a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Wanda Glenn, a Sears employee, was diagnosed with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart condition whose symptoms include fatigue and shortness of breath.  She applied for plan disability benefits in June 2000, and MetLife concluded that she met the plan\xe2\x80\x99s standard for an initial 24 months of benefits, namely, that she could not \xe2\x80\x9cperform the material duties of [her] own job.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 159a\xe2\x80\x93160a.  MetLife also directed Glenn to a law firm that would assist her in applying for federal Social Security disability benefits (some of which MetLife itself would be entitled to receive as an offset to the more generous plan benefits).  In April 2002, an Administrative Law Judge found that Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s illness prevented her not only from performing her own job but also \xe2\x80\x9cfrom performing any<em> </em>jobs [for which she could qualify] existing in significant numbers in the national economy.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a; see also 20 CFR \xc2\xa7404.1520(g) (2007).  The Social Security Administration consequently granted Glenn permanent disability payments retroactive to April 2000.  Glenn herself kept none of the backdated benefits: three-quarters went to MetLife, and the rest (plus some additional money) went to the lawyers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To continue receiving Sears plan disability benefits after 24 months, Glenn had to meet a stricter, Social-Security-type standard, namely, that her medical condition rendered her incapable of performing not only her own job but of performing \xe2\x80\x9cthe material duties of any gainful occupation for which\xe2\x80\x9d she was \xe2\x80\x9creasonably qualified.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 160a.  MetLife denied Glenn this extended benefit because it found that she was \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of performing full time sedentary work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 31a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After exhausting her administrative remedies, Glenn brought this federal lawsuit, seeking judicial review of MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s denial of benefits.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B); 461 F.\xc2\xa03d 660, 665 (CA6 2006).  The District Court denied relief.  Glenn appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Because the plan granted MetLife \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary authority to \xe2\x80\xa6 determine benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals reviewed the administrative record under a deferential standard.  <em>Id.,</em> at 666.  In doing so, it treated \xe2\x80\x9cas a relevant factor\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cconflict of interest\xe2\x80\x9d arising out of the fact that MetLife was \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized both to decide whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals ultimately set aside MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s denial of benefits in light of a combination of several circumstances: (1) the conflict of interest; (2) MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reconcile its own conclusion that Glenn could work in other jobs with the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that she could not; (3) MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s focus upon one treating physician report suggesting that Glenn could work in other jobs at the expense of other, more detailed treating physician reports indicating that she could not; (4) MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide all of the treating physician reports to its own hired experts; and (5) MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take account of evidence indicating that stress aggravated Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s condition.  See <em>id.,</em> at 674.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MetLife sought certiorari, asking us to determine whether a plan administrator that both evaluates and pays claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionary benefit determinations.  The Solicitor General suggested that we also consider \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98how\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d any such conflict should \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be taken into account on judicial review of a discretionary benefit determination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>on Pet. for Cert. 22.

In our view, it does.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That answer is clear where it is the employer that both funds the plan and evaluates the claims.  In such a circumstance, \xe2\x80\x9cevery dollar provided in benefits is a dollar spent by \xe2\x80\xa6 the employer; and every dollar saved \xe2\x80\xa6 is a dollar in [the employer\xe2\x80\x99s] pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bruch</em> v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em>, 828 F.\xc2\xa02d 134, 144 (CA3 1987).  The employer\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary interest may counsel in favor of granting a borderline claim while its immediate financial interest counsels to the contrary.  Thus, the employer has an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest \xe2\x80\xa6 conflicting with that of the beneficiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d the type of conflict that judges must take into account when they review the discretionary acts of a trustee of a common-law trust.  Restatement \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d;</em> see also <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 115 (citing that Restatement comment); cf. Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 319 (8th ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cconflict of interest\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9creal or seeming incompatibility between one\xe2\x80\x99s private interests and one\xe2\x80\x99s public or fiduciary duties\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, <em>Firestone </em>itself involved an employer who administered an ERISA benefit plan and who both evaluated claims and paid for benefits.  See 489 U. S.<em>,</em> at 105.  And thus that circumstance quite possibly was what the Court had in mind when it mentioned conflicted administrators.  See <em>id.,</em> at 115.  The <em>Firestone </em>parties, while disagreeing about other matters, agreed that the dual role created a conflict of interest of some kind in the employer.  See Brief for Petitioners 6\xe2\x80\x937, 27\xe2\x80\x9329, Brief for Respondents 9, 26, and Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22, in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, O.

But that fact cannot change our conclusion.  At trust law, the fact that a settlor (the person establishing the trust) approves a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conflict does not change the legal need for a judge later to take account of that conflict in reviewing the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decisionmaking.

S. 489</a>, 497 (1996); (2) with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts not to deter employers from setting up benefit plans, see <em>ibid.</em>, and (3) with an ERISA provision specifically allowing employers to administer their own plans, see 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71108(c)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we cannot find in these considerations any significant inconsistency.  As to the first, we note that trust law functions well with a similar standard.  As to the second, we have no reason, empirical or otherwise, to believe that our decision will seriously discourage the creation of benefit plans.  As to the third, we have just explained why approval of a conflicted trustee differs from review of that trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conflicted decisionmaking.  As to all three taken together, we believe them outweighed by \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Varity</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 497 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting congressional purposes\xe2\x80\x9d in enacting ERISA).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer to the conflict question is less clear where (as here) the plan administrator is not the employer itself but rather a professional insurance company. Such a company, MetLife would argue, likely has a much greater incentive than a self-insuring employer to provide accurate claims processing.  That is because the insurance company typically charges a fee that attempts to account for the cost of claims payouts, with the result that paying an individual claim does not come to the same extent from the company\xe2\x80\x99s own pocket.  It is also because the marketplace (and regulators) may well punish an insurance company when its products, or ingredients of its products, fall below par.  And claims processing, an ingredient of the insurance company\xe2\x80\x99s product, falls below par when it seeks a biased result, rather than an accurate one.  Why, MetLife might ask, should one consider an insurance company <em>inherently </em>more conflicted than any other market participant, say, a manufacturer who might earn more money in the short run by producing a product with poor quality steel or a lawyer with an incentive to work more slowly than necessary, thereby accumulating more billable hours?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Conceding these differences, we nonetheless continue to believe that for ERISA purposes a conflict exists.  For one thing, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s own conflict may extend to its selection of an insurance company to administer its plan.  An employer choosing an administrator in effect buys insurance for others and consequently (when compared to the marketplace customer who buys for himself) may be more interested in an insurance company with low rates than in one with accurate claims processing.  Cf. Langbein, Trust Law as Regulatory Law, 101 Nw. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1315, 1323\xe2\x80\x931324 (2007) (observing that employees are rarely involved in plan negotiations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another, ERISA imposes higher-than-marketplace quality standards on insurers.  It sets forth a special standard of care upon a plan administrator, namely, that the administrator \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge [its] duties\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to discretionary claims processing \xe2\x80\x9csolely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x9d of the plan, \xc2\xa71104(a)(1); it simultaneously underscores the particular importance of accurate claims processing by insisting that administrators \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a \xe2\x80\x98full and fair review\xe2\x80\x99 of claim denials,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Firestone</em>, 489 U. S., at 113 (quoting \xc2\xa71133(2)); and it supplements marketplace and regulatory controls with judicial review of individual claim denials, see \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, a legal rule that treats insurance company administrators and employers alike in respect to the <em>existence </em>of a conflict can nonetheless take account of the circumstances to which MetLife points so far as it treats those, or similar, circumstances as diminishing the <em>significance </em>or <em>severity</em> of the conflict in individual cases.  See Part IV, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the question of \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x9d the conflict we have just identified should \xe2\x80\x9cbe taken into account on judicial review of a discretionary benefit determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S. __ (2008).  In<em> </em>doing so, we elucidate what this Court set forth in <em>Firestone, </em>namely, that a conflict should \xe2\x80\x9cbe weighed as a \xe2\x80\x98factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 115 (quoting Restatement \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d;</em> alteration omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not believe that <em>Firestone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>statement implies a change in the <em>standard </em>of review, say, from deferential to <em>de novo</em> review.  Trust law continues to apply a deferential standard of review to the discretionary decisionmaking of a conflicted trustee, while at the same time requiring the reviewing judge to take account of the conflict when determining whether the trustee, substantively or procedurally, has abused his discretion.  See Restatement \xc2\xa7187, Comments <em>d</em>\xe2\x80\x93<em>j; id.,</em> \xc2\xa7107, Comment <em>f;</em> Scott \xc2\xa718.2, at 1342\xe2\x80\x931344.  We see no reason to forsake <em>Firestone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reliance upon trust law in this respect.  See 489 U. S., at 111\xe2\x80\x93115.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor would we overturn <em>Firestone </em>by adopting a rule that in practice could bring about near universal review by judges <em>de novo\xe2\x80\x94i.e.</em>, without deference<em>\xe2\x80\x94</em>of the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of ERISA plan claims denials.  See Brief for America\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Plans et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3\xe2\x80\x934 (many ERISA plans grant discretionary authority to administrators that combine evaluation and payment functions).  Had Congress intended such a system of review, we believe it would not have left to the courts the development of review standards but would have said more on the subject.  See <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 109 (\xe2\x80\x9cERISA does not\nset out the appropriate standard of review for actions under \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x9d); compare, <em>e.g.</em>, C. Gresenz et\xc2\xa0al.,\nA Flood of Litigation? 8 (1999), http://www.rand.org/pubs/\nissue_papers/2006/IP184.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 9, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (estimating that 1.9 million beneficiaries of ERISA plans have health care claims denied each year), with Caseload of Federal Courts Remains Steady Overall (Mar. 11, 2008), http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/2008/\ncaseload.cfm (257,507 total civil filings in federal court in 2007); cf. <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001) (Congress does not \xe2\x80\x9chide elephants in mouseholes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither do we believe it necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payor conflict.  In principle, as we have said, conflicts are but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.  Benefits decisions arise in too many contexts, concern too many circumstances, and can relate in too many different ways to conflicts\xe2\x80\x94which themselves vary in kind and in degree of seriousness\xe2\x80\x94for us to come up with a one-size-fits-all procedural system that is likely to promote fair and accurate review.  Indeed, special procedural rules would create further complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may already be too costly for many of those who seek redress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that <em>Firestone </em>means what the word \xe2\x80\x9cfactor\xe2\x80\x9d implies, namely, that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials, they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one. This kind of review is no stranger to the judicial system.  Not only trust law, but also administrative law, can ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.  See Restatement \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d;</em> cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/index.html">401 U. S. 402</a>, 415\xe2\x80\x93417 (1971)<em> </em>(review of governmental decision for abuse of discretion); <em>Universal Camera Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/index.html">340 U. S. 474</a> (1951) (review of agency factfinding).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In such instances, any one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced, the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor\xe2\x80\x99s inherent or case-specific importance.  The conflict of interest at issue here, for example, should prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.  See Langbein, <em>supra</em>, at 1317\xe2\x80\x931321 (detailing such a history for one large insurer).  It should prove less important (perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy, for example, by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances, or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.  See Herzel &amp; Colling, The Chinese Wall and Conflict of Interest in Banks, 34 Bus. Law 73, 114 (1978) (recommending interdepartmental information walls to reduce bank conflicts); Brief for Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>15 (suggesting that insurers have incentives to reward claims processors for their accuracy); cf. generally J. Mashaw, Bureaucratic Justice (1983) (discussing internal controls as a sound method of producing administrative accuracy).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion in the present case illustrates the combination-of-factors method of review. The record says little about MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to assure accurate claims assessment.  The Court of Appeals gave the conflict weight to some degree; its opinion suggests that, in context, the court would not have found the conflict alone determinative.  See 461 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 666, 674.  The court instead focused more heavily on other factors.  In particular, the court found questionable the fact that MetLife had encouraged Glenn to argue to the Social Security Administration that she could do no work, received the bulk of the benefits of her success in doing so (the remainder going to the lawyers it recommended), and then ignored the agency\xe2\x80\x99s finding in concluding that Glenn could in fact do sedentary work.  See <em>id.</em>, at 666\xe2\x80\x93669.  This course of events was not only an important factor in its own right (because it suggested procedural unreasonableness), but also would have justified the court in giving more weight to the conflict (because MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly inconsistent positions were both financially advantageous).  And the court furthermore observed that MetLife had emphasized a certain medical report that favored a denial of benefits, had deemphasized certain other reports that suggested a contrary conclusion, and had failed to provide its independent vocational and medical experts with all of the relevant evidence.  See <em>id.,</em> at 669\xe2\x80\x93674.  All these serious concerns, taken together with some degree of conflicting interests on MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s part, led the court to set aside MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decision.  See <em>id.,</em> at 674\xe2\x80\x93675.  We can find nothing improper in the way in which the court conducted its review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that our elucidation of <em>Firestone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard does not consist of a detailed set of instructions.  In this respect, we find pertinent this Court\xe2\x80\x99s comments made in a somewhat different context, the context of court review of agency factfinding.  See <em>Universal Camera Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>.  In explaining how a reviewing court should take account of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reversal of its own examiner\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings, this Court did not lay down a detailed set of instructions.  It simply held that the reviewing judge should take account of that circumstance as a factor in determining the ultimate adequacy of the record\xe2\x80\x99s support for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own factual conclusion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 492\xe2\x80\x93497.  In so holding, the Court noted that it had not enunciated a precise standard.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 493.  But it warned against creating formulas that will \xe2\x80\x9cfalsif[y] the actual process of judging\xe2\x80\x9d or serve as \xe2\x80\x9cinstrument[s] of futile casuistry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at  489.  The Court added that there \xe2\x80\x9care no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>It concluded then, as we do now, that the \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ant of certainty\xe2\x80\x9d in judicial standards \xe2\x80\x9cpartly reflects the intractability of any formula to furnish definiteness of content for all the impalpable factors involved in judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 477.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962712">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF ROBERTS, C.

I agree that a third-party insurer\xe2\x80\x99s dual role as a claims administrator and plan funder gives rise to a conflict of interest that is pertinent in reviewing claims decisions.  I part ways with the majority, however, when it comes to <em>how</em> such a conflict should matter.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  The majority would accord weight, of varying and indeterminate amount, to the existence of such a conflict in every case where it is present.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach would allow the bare existence of a conflict to enhance the significance of other factors already considered by reviewing courts, even if the conflict is not shown to have played any role in the denial of benefits.  The end result is to increase the level of scrutiny in every case in which there is a conflict\xe2\x80\x94that is, in many if not most ERISA cases\xe2\x80\x94thereby undermining the deference owed to plan administrators when the plan vests discretion in them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would instead consider the conflict of interest on review only where there is evidence that the benefits denial was motivated or affected by the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s conflict.  No such evidence was presented in this case.  I would nonetheless affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit, because that court was justified in finding an abuse of discretion on the facts of this case\xe2\x80\x94conflict or not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a> (1989), this Court recognized that plan sponsors could, by the terms of the plan, reserve the authority to make discretionary claims decisions that courts would review only for an abuse of that discretion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 111.  We have long recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Dedeaux</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/41/index.html">481 U. S. 41</a>, 54 (1987).  Ensuring that reviewing courts respect the discretionary authority conferred on ERISA fiduciaries encourages employers to provide medical and retirement benefits to their employees through ERISA-governed plans\xe2\x80\x94something they are not required to do. Cf. <em>Aetna Health Inc.</em> v. <em>Davila</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/200/index.html">542 U. S. 200</a>, 215 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conflict of interest at issue here is a common feature of ERISA plans.  The majority acknowledges that the \xe2\x80\x9clion\xe2\x80\x99s share of ERISA plan claims denials\xe2\x80\x9d are made by administrators that both evaluate and pay claims.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9; see also <em>Guthrie</em> v. <em>National Rural Elec. Coop. Assn. Long-Term Disability Plan</em>, 509 F.\xc2\xa03d 644, 650 (CA4 2007) (describing use of dual-role administrators as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98simple and commonplace\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Colucci</em> v. <em>Agfa Corp. Severance Pay Plan</em>, 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 170, 179 (CA4 2005)); <em>Hall</em> v. <em>UNUM Life Ins. Co.</em>, 300 F.\xc2\xa03d 1197, 1205 (CA10 2002) (declining to permit additional evidence on review \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever the same party is the administrator and payor\xe2\x80\x9d because such an arrangement is \xe2\x80\x9ccommonplace\xe2\x80\x9d).  For this reason, the majority is surely correct in concluding that it is important to retain deferential review for decisions made by conflicted administrators, in order to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cnear universal review by judges <em>de novo</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach does not do so.  Saying that courts should consider the mere existence of a conflict in every case, without focusing that consideration in any way, invites the substitution of judicial discretion for the discretion of the plan administrator.  Judicial review under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is less constrained, because courts can look to the bare presence of a conflict as authorizing more exacting scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This problem is exacerbated because the majority is so imprecise about how the existence of a conflict should be treated in a reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  The majority is forthright about this failing.  In a triumph of understatement, the Court acknowledges that its approach \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not consist of a detailed set of instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The majority tries to transform this vice into a virtue, pointing to the practice of courts in reviewing agency determinations.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The standard of review for agency determinations has little to nothing to do with the appropriate test for identifying ERISA benefits decisions influenced by a conflict of interest.  In fact, we have rejected this analogy before, see <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 109\xe2\x80\x93110 (rejecting the arbitrary and capricious standard of review under the Labor Management and Relations Act for claims brought under ERISA \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B)), and not even the Solicitor General, whose position the majority accepts, endorses it, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 29\xe2\x80\x9330, n.\xc2\xa03 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9ckey differences between ERISA and the administrative law context\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s strained analogy, <em>Universal Camera</em> <em>Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/index.html">340 U. S. 474</a> (1951), makes an unexpected appearance on stage.  The case is cited for the proposition that the lack of certainty in judicial standards \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98partly reflects the intractability of any formula to furnish definiteness of content for all the impalpable factors involved in judicial review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (quoting <em>Universal Camera, supra, </em>at 477).  Maybe.  But certainty and predictability are important criteria under ERISA, and employers considering whether to establish ERISA plans can have no notion what it means to say that a standard feature of such plans will be one of the \xe2\x80\x9cimpalpable factors involved in judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d of benefits decisions.  See <em>Rush Prudential HMO, Inc.</em> v. <em>Moran</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/355/index.html">536 U. S. 355</a>, 379 (2002) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cERISA\xe2\x80\x99s policy of inducing employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court leaves the law more uncertain, more unpredictable than it found it.  Cf. O. Holmes, The Common Law 101 (M. Howe ed. 1963) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he tendency of the law must always be to narrow the field of uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nothing in <em>Firestone</em> compels the majority\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen-sink approach.  In <em>Firestone</em>, the Court stated that a conflict of interest \xe2\x80\x9cmust be weighed as a \xe2\x80\x98facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 115 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d</em> (1959) (alteration in original)).  The cited Restatement confirms that treating the existence of a conflict of interest \xe2\x80\x9cas a factor\xe2\x80\x9d means considering whether the conflicted trustee \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>acting</em> from an improper motive\xe2\x80\x9d so as to \xe2\x80\x9cfurther some interest of his own or of a person other than the beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>g </em>(emphasis added).  See also <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The language in <em>Firestone</em> does not specify whether the existence of a conflict should be thrown into the mix in an indeterminate way along with all other considerations pertinent in reviewing a benefits decision, as the majority would apparently have it, or instead weighed to determine whether it actually affected the decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is the actual motivation that matters in reviewing benefits decisions for an abuse of discretion, not the bare presence of the conflict itself.  Consonant with this understanding, a conflict of interest can support a finding that an administrator abused its discretion only where the evidence demonstrates that the conflict actually motivated or influenced the claims decision.  Such evidence may take many forms.  It may, for example, appear on the face of the plan, see <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a>, 227, n.\xc2\xa07 (2000) (offering hypothetical example of a plan that gives \xe2\x80\x9ca bonus for administrators who denied benefits to every 10th beneficiary\xe2\x80\x9d); it may be shown by evidence of other improper incentives, see <em>Armstrong</em> v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co.</em>, 128 F.\xc2\xa03d 1263, 1265 (CA8 1997) (insurer provided incentives and bonuses to claims reviewers for \xe2\x80\x9cclaims savings\xe2\x80\x9d); or it may be shown by a pattern or practice of unreasonably denying meritorious claims, see <em>Radford Trust</em> v. <em>First Unum Life Ins. Co.</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 226, 247 (Mass. 2004) (finding a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of erroneous and arbitrary benefits denials, bad faith contract misinterpretations, and other unscrupulous tactics\xe2\x80\x9d).  The mere existence of a conflict, however, is not justification for heightening the level of scrutiny, either on its own or by enhancing the significance of other factors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s application of its approach confirms its overbroad reach and indeterminate nature.  Three sets of circumstances, the majority finds, warrant the conclusion that MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest influenced its decision to deny Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s claim for benefits: MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s failure to account for the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s finding of disability after MetLife encouraged Glenn to apply to the agency for benefits; MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis of favorable medical reports and deemphasis of unfavorable ones; and MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide its internal experts with all the relevant evidence of Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s medical condition.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  These facts simply prove that MetLife abused its discretion in failing to consider relevant, expert evidence on the question of Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s disability status.  There is no basis for supposing that the conflict of interest lent any greater significance to these factors, and no logical reason to give the factors an extra dollop of weight because of the structural conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the fact that MetLife took \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly inconsistent positions\xe2\x80\x9d regarding Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s claim for Social Security benefits falls short.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  That MetLife stood to gain financially from ignoring the agency\xe2\x80\x99s finding and denying Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not show improper motivation.  If it did, every decision to deny a claim made by a dual-role administrator would automatically qualify as an abuse of discretion.  No one here advocates such a <em>per se</em> rule.  As for MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s referral of Glenn to the agency, the plan itself required MetLife to deduct an estimated amount of Social Security disability benefits \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not [Glenn] actually appl[ied] for and receive[d] those amounts,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 167a, and to assist plan participants like Glenn in applying for Social Security benefits, see <em>id.</em>, at 168a.  Hence, it was not the conflict that prompted MetLife to refer Glenn to the agency, but the plan itself, a requirement that any administrator, whether conflicted or not, would be obligated to enforce.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, there is no indication that the Sixth Circuit viewed the deficiencies in MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s decision as a product of its conflict of interest.  Apart from remarking on the conflict at the outset and the conclusion of its opinion, see 461 F.\xc2\xa03d 660, 666, 674 (2006), the court never again mentioned MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent obligations in the course of reversing the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  As the court explained, MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas not the product of a principled and deliberative reasoning process.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 674.  MetLife failed to acknowledge the contrary conclusion reached by the Social Security Administration, gave scant weight to the contrary medical evidence supplied by Dr. Patel, and neglected to provide its internal experts with Dr. Patel\xe2\x80\x99s reports.  <em>Ibid</em>.; see also <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In these circumstances, the Court of Appeals was justified in finding an abuse of discretion wholly apart from MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore affirm the judgment below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962713">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nMETROPOLITAN LIFE INS.

A third-party insurance company that administers an ERISA-governed disability plan and that pays for benefits out of its own coffers profits with each benefits claim it rejects.  I see no reason why the Court must volunteer, however, that <em>an employer</em> who administers its own ERISA-governed plan \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d has a conflict of interest.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5.  At least one Court of Appeals has thought that while the insurance-company administrator has a conflict, the employer-administrator does not.  See <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Agfa Corp. Severance Pay Plan</em>, 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 170, 179 (CA4 2005).  I would not resolve this question until it has been presented and argued, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary and uninvited resolution must be regarded as dictum.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more important question is how the existence of a conflict should bear upon judicial review of the administrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and on that score I am in fundamental disagreement with the Court.  Even if the choice were mine as a policy matter, I would not adopt the Court\xe2\x80\x99s totality-of-the-circumstances (so-called) \xe2\x80\x9ctest,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the existence of a conflict is to be put into the mix and given some (unspecified) \xe2\x80\x9cweight.\xe2\x80\x9d  This makes each case unique, and hence the outcome of each case unpredictable\xe2\x80\x94not a reasonable position in which to place the administrator that has been explicitly given discretion by the creator of the plan, despite the existence of a conflict.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  More importantly, however, this is not a question to be solved by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s policy views; our cases make clear that it is to be governed by the law of trusts.  Under that law, a fiduciary with a conflict does not abuse its discretion unless the conflict <em>actually</em> and <em>improperly motivates</em> the decision.  There is no evidence of that here.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our opinion in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a> (1989), does not provide the answer to the all-important question in this case, but it does direct us to the answer.  It held that federal courts hearing 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B) claims should review the decisions of ERISA-plan administrators the same way that courts have traditionally reviewed decisions of trustees.  489 U. S., at 111.  In trust law, the decision of a trustee who was not vested with discretion would be reviewed <em>de novo</em>.  <em>Id.,</em> at 112\xe2\x80\x93113.  Citing the Restatement of Trusts current at the time of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, <em>Firestone</em> acknowledged that courts traditionally would defer to trustees vested with discretion, but rejected that course in the case at hand because, among other reasons, the <em>Firestone</em> plan did not vest its administrator with discretion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 111 (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187 (1959)).  Accordingly, <em>Firestone</em> had no occasion to consider the scope of, or limitations on, the deference accorded to fiduciaries with discretion.  But in sheer dictum quoting a portion of one comment of the Restatement, our opinion said, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f course, if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a \xe2\x80\x98facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 115 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court takes that throwaway dictum literally and builds a castle upon it.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  But the dictum cannot bear that weight, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celucidation\xe2\x80\x9d of the sentence does not reveal trust-law practice as much as it reveals the Justices\xe2\x80\x99 fondness for a judge-liberating totality-of-the-circumstances \xe2\x80\x9ctest.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Restatement does indeed list in Comment <em>d </em>certain circumstances (including conflict of interest) that \xe2\x80\x9cmay be relevant\xe2\x80\x9d to deciding whether a trustee has abused his discretion.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It does <em>not</em>, however, suggest that they should all be chucked into a brown paper bag and shaken up to determine the answer.  Nowhere does it mention the majority\xe2\x80\x99s <em>modus operandi</em> of \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d all these factors together.  To the contrary, the immediately following Comments <em>(e\xe2\x80\x93l)</em> precisely elaborate upon <em>how</em> some of those factors (factor (1), extent of discretion, see Comment <em>j;</em> factor (4), existence of an external standard for judging reasonableness, see Comment <em>i;</em> factors (5) and (6), motives of the trustee and conflict of interest, see Comment <em>g</em>) are relevant\xe2\x80\x94making very clear that each of them can be <em>alone </em>determinative, without the necessity of \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d other factors.  These later Comments also address other factors not even included in the earlier listing, some of which can be alone determinative.  See Comment <em>h</em>, Trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to use his judgment; Comment <em>k</em>, Limits of power of settlor to confer discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of taking the pain to reconcile the entirety of the Restatement section with the <em>Firestone</em> dictum, the Court treats the dictum like a statutory command, and makes up a standard (if one can call it that) to make sense of the dictum.  The opinion is painfully opaque, despite its promise of elucidation.  It variously describes the object of judicial review as \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether the trustee, substantively or procedurally, has abused his discretion\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>ante</em>, at 9), determining \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawfulness of benefit denials\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>ante</em>, at 10), and as tantamount to \xe2\x80\x9creview of agency factfinding\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>ante</em>, at 12).  How a court should go about conducting this review is unclear.  The opinion is rife with instruction on what a court should <em>not</em> do. See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  In the final analysis, the Court seems to advance a gestalt reasonableness standard (a \xe2\x80\x9ccombination-of-factors method of review,\xe2\x80\x9d the opinion calls it, <em>ante</em>, at 11), by which a reviewing court, mindful of being deferential, should nonetheless consider all the circumstances, weigh them as it thinks best, then divine whether a fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decision should be overturned.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Notwithstanding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assurances to the contrary, <em>ante</em>, at 9, that is nothing but <em>de novo</em> review in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking to the common law of trusts (which is, after all, what the <em>holding</em> of <em>Firestone</em> binds us to do), I would adopt the entirety of the Restatement\xe2\x80\x99s clear guidelines for judicial review.  In trust law, a court reviewing a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s decision would substitute its own <em>de novo</em> judgment for a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s only if it found either that the trustee had no discretion in making the decision, see <em>Firestone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 111\xe2\x80\x93112, or that the trustee had discretion but abused it, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187.  Otherwise, the court would defer to the trustee.  Cf. <em>Shelton</em> v. <em>King</em>, 229\xc2\xa0U. S.\xc2\xa090, 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (1913).  \xe2\x80\x9cAbuse of discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Restatement uses the term, refers specifically to four distinct failures: the trustee acted dishonestly; he acted with some other improper motive; he failed to use judgment; or he acted beyond the bounds of a reasonable judgment.  See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>e</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Restatement discusses all four of these manners of abusing discretion successively, in Comments <em>f, g, h, </em>and <em>i</em>, describing the aim of a court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into each.  A trustee abuses his discretion by acting dishonestly when, for example, he accepts bribes.  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>f</em>.  A trustee abuses his discretion by failing to use his judgment, when he acts \xe2\x80\x9cwithout knowledge of or inquiry into the relevant circumstances and merely as a result of his arbitrary decision or whim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>h</em>.  A trustee abuses his discretion by acting unreasonably when his decision is substantively unreasonable either with regard to his exercise of a discretionary power or with regard to his assessment of whether the preconditions to that exercise have been met.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>i</em>.  And\xe2\x80\x94most important for this case\xe2\x80\x94a trustee abuses his discretion by acting on an improper motive when he acts \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a motive other than to further the purposes of the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>g</em>.  Improper motives include \xe2\x80\x9cspite or prejudice or <em>to further some interest of his own </em>or of a person other than the beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The four abuses of discretion are clearly separate and distinct.  Indeed, the circumstances the Restatement identifies as relevant for finding each abuse of discretion are not identified as relevant for finding the other abuses of discretion.  For instance, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence or non-existence, the definiteness or indefiniteness, of an external standard by which the reasonableness of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct can be judged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d</em>, is alluded to <em>only</em> in the later Comment dealing with abuse of discretion by acting beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment, <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>i</em>.  And particularly relevant to the present case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence or nonexistence of an interest in the trustee conflicting with that of the beneficiaries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d</em>, is mentioned only in the later Comment dealing with abuse of discretion by reason of improper motive, <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>g</em>.  The other Comments do not even hint that a conflict of interest is relevant to determining whether one of the other three types of abuse of discretion exists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common sense confirms that a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest is irrelevant to determining the substantive reasonableness of his decision.  A reasonable decision is reasonable whether or not the person who makes it has a conflict.  If it were otherwise, the consequences would be perverse: A trustee without a conflict could take either of two reasonable courses of action, but a trustee with a conflict, facing the same two choices, would be compelled to take the course that avoids the appearance of self-dealing.  He would have to do that even if he thought the other one would better serve the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s interest, lest his determination be set aside as unreasonable.  It makes no sense to say that a lurking conflict of interest, or the mere identity of the trustee, can make a reasonable decision unreasonable, or a well-thought-out, informed decision uninformed or arbitrary.  The Restatement echoes the commonsensical view: It explains that a court applying trust law must pretermit its inquiry into whether a trustee abused his discretion by acting unreasonably when there is no standard for evaluating reasonableness, but \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n such a case \xe2\x80\xa6 the court will interpose if the trustee act[ed] dishonestly, or from some improper motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>i</em>.  That explanation plainly excludes the court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conflict of interest is relevant (and <em>only </em>relevant) for determining whether he abused his discretion by acting with an improper motive.  It does not itself prove that he did so, but it is the predicate for an inquiry into motive, and can be part of the circumstantial evidence establishing wrongful motive.  That circumstantial evidence could theoretically include the unreasonableness of the decision\xe2\x80\x94but using it for that purpose would be entirely redundant, since unreasonableness <em>alone</em> suffices to establish an abuse of discretion.  There are no gradations of reasonableness, so that one might infer that a trustee acted upon his conflict of interest when he chose a \xe2\x80\x9cless reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d yet self-serving, course, but not when he chose a \xe2\x80\x9cmore reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d yet self-serving, course.  Reasonable is reasonable.  A reasonable decision is one over which reasonable minds seeking the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d answer could disagree.  It is a course that a trustee acting in the best interest of the beneficiary <em>might</em> have chosen.  Gradating reasonableness, and making it a \xe2\x80\x9cfactor\xe2\x80\x9d in the improper-motive determination, would have the precise effect of eliminating the discretion that the settlor has intentionally conferred upon the trustee with a conflict, for such a trustee would be foreclosed from making an otherwise reasonable decision.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent essentially asks us to presume that all fiduciaries with a conflict act in their selfish interest, so that their decisions are automatically reviewed with less than total deference (how much less is unspecified).  But if one is to draw any inference about a fiduciary from the fact that he made an informed, reasonable, though apparently self-serving discretionary decision, it should be that he <em>suppressed</em> his selfish interest (as the settlor anticipated) in compliance with his duties of good faith and loyalty.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Moose</em>, 266 Ark. 926, 933\xe2\x80\x93934, 590 S. W. 2d 665, 670\xe2\x80\x93671 (1979) (citing <em>Jarvis</em> v. <em>Boatmen\xe2\x80\x99s Nat. Bank of St.\xc2\xa0Louis</em>, 478 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 266, 273 (Mo. 1972)).  Only such a presumption can vindicate the trust principles and ERISA provisions that permit settlors to appoint fiduciaries with a conflict in the first place.  See <em>Pegram</em> v. <em>Herdrich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/211/index.html">530 U. S. 211</a>, 225 (2000).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the Restatement\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines to this case, I conclude that the only possible basis for finding an abuse of discretion in this case would be unreasonableness of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s determination of no disability.  The principal factor suggesting that is the finding of disability by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  But ERISA fiduciaries need not always reconcile their determinations with the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s, nor is the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion entitled to any special weight.  Cf. <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan</em> v. <em>Nord</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/822/index.html">538 U. S. 822</a>, 834 (2003).  The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s determination may have been wrong, and it was contradicted by other medical opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We did not take this case to make the reasonableness determination, but rather to clarify when a conflict exists, and how it should be taken into account.  I would remand to the Court of Appeals for its determination of the reasonableness of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s denial, without regard to the existence of a conflict of interest.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Comment <em>d</em> provides in full: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Factors in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.  </em>In determining the question whether the trustee is guilty of an abuse of discretion in exercising or failing to exercise a power, the following circumstances may be relevant: (1) the extent of the discretion conferred upon the trustee by the terms of the trust; (2) the purposes of the trust; (3) the nature of the power; (4) the existence or non-existence, the definiteness or indefiniteness, of an external standard by which the reasonableness of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct can be judged; (5) the motives of the trustee in exercising or refraining from exercising the power; (6) the existence or nonexistence of an interest in the trustee conflicting with that of the beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7187, Comment <em>d </em>(1959).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I do not take the Court to adopt respondent\xe2\x80\x99s position that courts should consider all the circumstances to determine <em>how much</em> <em>deference</em> a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s decision deserves.

S. 101</a> (1989).  In my view this is correct, and I concur in those parts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that discuss this framework.  In my submission, however, the case should be remanded so that the Court of Appeals can apply the standards the Court now explains to these facts.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two ways to read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.

This interpretation is the one consistent with the question the Court should address and with the way the case was presented to us.  A second reading is that the Court concludes MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was so egregious that it was an abuse of discretion even if there were no conflict at all; but if that is so then the first 11 pages of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is unnecessary to its disposition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has set forth a workable framework for taking potential conflicts of interest in ERISA benefits disputes into account.  It is consistent with our opinion in <em>Firestone</em>, and it protects the interests of plan beneficiaries without undermining the ability of insurance companies to act simultaneously as plan administrators and plan funders.  The linchpin of this framework is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that a structural conflict \xe2\x80\x9cshould prove less important (perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy, for example, by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances, or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  And it is on this point that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion parts company with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  The Court acknowledges that the structural conflict of interest played some role in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination that MetLife had abused its discretion.  <em>Ibid.  </em>But as far as one can tell, the Court of Appeals made no effort to assess whether MetLife employed structural safeguards to avoid conflicts of interest, safeguards the Court says can cause the importance of a conflict to vanish.       </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless affirms the judgment, without giving MetLife a chance to defend its decision under the standards the Court articulates today.  In doing so, it notes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record says little about MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to assure accurate claims assessment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., thereby implying that MetLife is to blame for failing to introduce structural evidence in the earlier proceedings.  Until today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, a party in MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s position had no notice of the relevance of these evidentiary considerations.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By reaching out to decide the merits of this case without remanding, the Court disadvantages MetLife solely for its failure to anticipate the instructions in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  This is a deviation from our practice, and it is unfair.  Given the importance of evidence pertaining to structural safeguards, this case should have been remanded to allow the Court of Appeals to consider this matter further in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in part but dissent from the order affirming the judgment.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
