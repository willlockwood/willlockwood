Three rivers form the heart of the Basin.  The Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers begin near Atlanta, flow south through Georgia, and ultimately converge at Lake Seminole, just north of Florida, where the Apalachicola River begins and flows 106 miles south into the Gulf of Mexico.  In 2013, Florida, the downstream State, sued Georgia, the upstream State, asking the Court to issue a decree equitably apportioning the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s waters.  The Court agreed to exercise its original jurisdiction and appointed a Special Master.  The United States declined to waive its sovereign immunity from suit in the case.  After conducting lengthy evidentiary proceedings, the Master submitted a Report recommending that the Court dismiss Florida\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  That recommendation, the parties agree, turns on a single issue\xe2\x80\x94namely, whether Florida met its initial burden in respect to redressability.  The Master concluded that Florida failed to make the requisite showing because it did not present clear and convincing evidence that its injuries could be redressed by a decree capping Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s upstream water consumption if the decree does not also bind the Corps.  Florida has filed exceptions to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The Special Master applied too strict a standard in concluding that Florida failed to meet its initial burden of demonstrating that the Court can eventually fashion an effective equitable decree.

In this realm, several related but more specific sets of principles guide the Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.  First, both Georgia and Florida possess \xe2\x80\x9can equal right to make a <i>reasonable use </i>of the waters of\xe2\x80\x9d the Flint River.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Willow River Power Co</i>.,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 499, 505.  Second, when confronted with competing claims to interstate water, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffort always is to secure an equitable apportionment without quibbling over formulas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>New Jersey</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336, 343.  Third<i>, </i>in light of the sovereign status and \xe2\x80\x9cequal dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of States, a complaining State\xe2\x80\x99s burden is \xe2\x80\x9cmuch greater\xe2\x80\x9d than the burden ordinarily shouldered by a private party seeking an injunction.  <i>Connecticut</i> v. <i>Massachusetts</i>,\n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 660, 669.  Among other things, it must demonstrate, by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98clear and convincing evidence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that it has suffered a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98threatened invasion of rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of serious magnitude.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Oregon</i>,\n\n297 U.\xc2\xa0S. 517, 522.  And to the extent the Court has addressed the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial burden\xe2\x80\x9d a State bears in respect to redressability, the Court has said that \xe2\x80\x9cit should be clear that [the complaining] State has not merely some technical right, but also a right with a corresponding benefit\xe2\x80\x9d as a precondition to any equitable apportionment.  <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,\n\n206 U. S. 46, 102, 109.  An effort to shape a decree cannot be \xe2\x80\x9ca vain thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Foster</i> v. <i>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</i>,\n\n146 U.\xc2\xa0S. 88, 101.  Finally,<i> </i>because equitable apportionment is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98flexible,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cformulaic,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court will seek to \xe2\x80\x9carrive at a \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cjust and equitable\xe2\x80\x9d apportionment\xe2\x80\x99 of an interstate stream\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cconsider[ing] \xe2\x80\x98<i>all relevant factors</i>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>South Carolina </i>v.<i> North Carolina</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 256, 271, including, <i>inter alia, </i>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, [and] the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is imposed on the former.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,\n\n459 U. S. 176, 183.  Because all relevant factors must be weighed, extensive and specific factual findings are essential for the Court to properly apply the doctrine of equitable apportionment.  See <i>Nebraska</i> v. <i>Wyoming</i>,\n\n325 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589, 618.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Special Master applied too strict a standard when he determined that the Court would not be able to fashion an appropriate equitable decree.  The Master referred to this as a \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d showing.  But it is \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d only in the sense that the Master has not yet determined key remedy-related matters, including the approximate amount of water that must flow into the Apalachicola River in order for Florida to receive a significant benefit from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of Flint River waters.  Unless and until the Special Master makes the findings of fact necessary to determine the nature and scope of likely harm caused by the absence of water and the amount of additional water necessary to ameliorate that harm significantly, the complaining State should not have to prove with specificity the details of an eventually workable decree by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d evidence.  Rather, the complaining State should have to show that, applying the principles of \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9capproximation,\xe2\x80\x9d it is likely to prove possible to fashion such a decree.  To require \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about the workability of a decree before the Court or a Special Master has a view about likely harms and likely amelioration is, at least in this case, to put the cart before the horse.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The Court reserves judgment as to the ultimate disposition of this case, addressing here only the narrow \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d question the Master addressed below\xe2\x80\x94namely, whether Florida has shown that its \xe2\x80\x9cinjur[ies can] effectively be redressed by limiting Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumptive use of water from the Basin without a decree binding the Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  Florida has made a legally sufficient showing as to the possibility of fashioning an effective remedial decree.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) The Report makes several key assumptions.  First, the Master assumed Florida has suffered harm as a result of decreased water flow into the Apalachicola River.  Second, the Master further assumed that Florida has shown that Georgia, contrary to equitable principles, has taken too much water from the Flint River.  Third, the Master assumed that Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s inequitable use of the water injured Florida.  At this stage of the proceeding and in light of these assumptions, Florida made a sufficient showing that the extra water that would result from its proposed consumption cap would both lead to increased streamflow in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River and significantly redress the economic and ecological harm that Florida has alleged.  In addition, the United States has made clear that the Corps will cooperate in helping to implement any determinations and obligations the Court sets forth in a final decree in this case.  While the Corps must take account of a variety of circumstances and statutory obligations when it allocates water, it cannot now be said that an effort to shape a decree here will prove \xe2\x80\x9ca vain thing,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Foster</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 101, since the record indicates that, if necessary and with the help of the United States, the Special Master, and the parties, the Court should be able to fashion a decree.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) Further findings, however, are needed on all of these evidentiary issues.  Florida will be entitled to a decree only if it is shown that \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits of the [apportionment] substantially outweigh the harm that might result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Colorado</i>, 459 U.

The Basin drains an area of more than 20,000 square miles across the southeastern United States.  Three interstate rivers form the heart of the Basin and are central to this case.  They are the Chattahoochee River, the Flint River, and the Apalachicola River.  It is easiest to think of these three rivers as forming the capital letter \xe2\x80\x9cY,\xe2\x80\x9d with each branch starting at a different point in northeastern Georgia near Atlanta and the stem running through the Flor- ida panhandle and emptying into Apalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Chattahoochee River is the western branch of this Y-shaped river system.  It runs from the foothills of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s Blue Ridge Mountains, through most of Georgia, down to Lake Seminole, just north of Florida.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers operates several dams and reservoirs along the Chattahoochee where it both stores water and controls the amount of water that flows downstream to Florida in accordance with the terms of its recently revised Master Water Control Manual (Master Manual).  As we shall discuss in more detail, Part IV, <i>infra</i>, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operations are important to the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Flint River, the eastern branch of the \xe2\x80\x9cY,\xe2\x80\x9d runs from just south of Atlanta down to the same lake, namely, Lake Seminole.  Unlike the Chattahoochee, there are no dams along the Flint River; it flows unimpeded through southern Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s farmland, where the greatest share of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s water is consumed by agricultural irrigation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After water from the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers mixes at Lake Seminole, the mixed water (now forming the stem of the Y) continues its southward journey.  At the southern end of Lake Seminole, it flows through the Woodruff Dam\xe2\x80\x94a dam also controlled by the Corps.  The mixed waters then change their name.  They are called the Apalachicola River, and under that name they flow 106 miles through the Florida Panhandle and finally empty into the Gulf of Mexico.  There, the fresh water of the Apalachicola River mixes with the Gulf\xe2\x80\x99s saltwater, forming Apalachicola Bay, which the United Nations, the United States, and the State of Florida have all recognized as one of the Northern Hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s most productive estuaries.  In total, the Apalachicola River accounts for 35% of the fresh water that flows along Florida\xe2\x80\x99s western coast.  See Joint Exh. 168, p. 39.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida and Georgia have long disputed the apportionment of the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s waters.  Florida contends that Georgia is consuming more than its equitable share of Flint River water.  It adds that, were Georgia to consume less water from the Flint River, more water would flow into Lake Seminole, pass through the Woodruff Dam and subsequently flow down the Apalachicola River (the Y\xe2\x80\x99s stem) and into Apalachicola Bay.  The additional water that would result from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumption would, Florida argues, help (among other things) to recover and maintain its oyster industry, which collapsed following a drought in 2012.  Georgia believes that it should not have to cut back on its Flint River water consumption because, in its view, it consumes no more than its equitable share.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court has recognized for more than a century its inherent authority, as part of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s grant of original jurisdiction, to equitably apportion interstate streams between States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Nebraska</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7).

But so far they have failed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1992, for example, the States signed a memorandum of agreement in which they \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to a process for cooperative management and development\xe2\x80\x9d of the three-river Basin and agreed to \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate fully as equal partners\xe2\x80\x9d in a \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive, basin-wide study\xe2\x80\x9d of its waters.

See <i>infra</i>, at 28.  The Master also wrote that Florida had failed to show \xe2\x80\x9cwith sufficient certainty that the Corps must (or will choose to) operate its projects so as to permit <i>all</i> additional flows in the Flint River\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c<i>the entire marginal increase</i> in streamflow\xe2\x80\x9d to reach Florida \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any substantial delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 48 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 24, 70 (similar).

In our view, unless and until the Special Master makes the findings of fact necessary to determine the nature and scope of likely harm caused by the absence of water and the amount of additional water necessary to ameliorate that harm significantly, the complaining State should not have to prove with specificity the details of an eventually workable decree by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d evidence.  Rather, the complaining State should have to show that, applying the principles of \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9capproximation\xe2\x80\x9d we discussed above, it is likely to prove possible to fashion such a decree.  See <i>supra,</i>  at 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To require more definite proof at the outset may well (at least on some occasions) make little sense.  Suppose, for example, downstream State A claims that upstream State B wastes at least 10,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water.  And suppose further that no decree could enforce a 10,000 cfs consumption cap but that it may well prove possible to enforce a lesser requirement.  If so, we would have to know at least approximately how much water will significantly ameliorate State A\xe2\x80\x99s water problem <i>before</i> we could know whether it is possible to shape a workable decree.  And the workability of decrees themselves, approximate as they may be, may depend upon more precise findings in respect to the nature and scope of the range of likely harms and likely benefits that a Special Master finds are actually likely to exist.  To require \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about the workability of a decree before the Court or a Special Master has a view about likely harms and likely amelioration is, at least in this case, to put the cart before the horse.  And that, we fear, is what the Master\xe2\x80\x99s statements, with their apparent references to a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing\xe2\x80\x9d evidence standard in respect to \xe2\x80\x9credressability\xe2\x80\x9d (where that refers to the availability of an eventual decree) have done here.

Would an equity-based cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Flint River lead to a significant increase in streamflow from the Flint River into Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River (the stem of the Y)?  The answer depends upon (1) the amount of extra water that would flow into <i>Lake Seminole</i> as a result of a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s Flint River water consumption; and (2) the amount of water that could actually flow through the Corps-controlled Woodruff Dam at Lake Seminole\xe2\x80\x99s southern end and into <i>Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The record shows that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water consumption could result in the release of considerable extra water into Lake Seminole.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Dr. David Sunding, testified that the cap would limit the average amount of water that Georgia could use annually and also reduce the amount of water that Georgia could use during drought years, which could \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially reduce [Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s] depletions of river flows .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by 1,500 to over 2,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) in peak summer months of drought years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Updated Pre-Filed Direct Testimony (PFDT) of Sunding \xc2\xb68; see also <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb688\xe2\x80\x9390.  Dr. Sunding added that it would cost Georgia roughly $35 million annually (less than 0.2% of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s annual bud- get) to reduce streamflow depletions by 2,000 cfs.  <i>Id</i>., \xc2\xb6113, Table 4.  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Dr. Robert Stavins, disputed these conclusions.  See Direct Testimony of Stavins \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb64, 90, 136; see also Brief for Georgia 18.  The Master did not make specific findings of fact regarding this aspect of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed remedy.  Rather than expressly making any findings, the Master apparently \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed] Florida\xe2\x80\x99s estimates of the increased streamflow that would result from a consumption cap.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 67, n.\xc2\xa043.  At this stage, we shall do the same.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And as we shall later discuss, the record suggests that an increase in streamflow of 1,500 to 2,000 cfs is reason- ably likely to benefit Florida significantly.  See <i>infra,</i> at 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (citing record evidence of benefits); see also Updated PFDT of J. David Allan \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63d, 26, 67 (Allan) (discussing ecological benefits of increasing streamflow by 300 to 500 cfs); 10 Tr. 2629:7\xe2\x80\x9315 (Kondolf) (detailing benefits of increasing streamflow into the Apalachicola River from 5,000 to 7,000 cfs); 3 <i>id</i>., at 591:6\xe2\x80\x93593:4, 596:17\xe2\x80\x93598:1 (Allan).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The key question, however, is whether the 1,500 to 2,000 cfs of extra water that will flow into Lake Seminole from the Flint River as a result of a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water consumption will flow beyond Lake Seminole, through the Woodruff Dam, and into the Apalachicola River at the relevant times.  That is where the Army Corps of Engineers enters the picture.  And it is where Florida disagrees with the Special Master and with Georgia.  The Special Master and Georgia believe that\xe2\x80\x94at any relevant time\xe2\x80\x94the Corps might \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d any extra Flint River water that flows into Lake Seminole by simultaneously reducing the amount of water that flows into that lake from the Chattahoochee River.  See Report 48\xe2\x80\x9353.  Thus, if the 1,500 to 2,000 cfs of <i>extra</i> water that would reach Lake Seminole from the Flint as a result of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed consumption cap, the question is whether and to what extent the Corps will \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d that extra streamflow by releasing 1,500 to 2,000 cfs <i>less</i> water into Lake Seminole from its upstream Chattahoochee reservoirs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, the Corps might, under certain circumstances, be authorized to \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d extra streamflow from the  Flint River.  As the Special Master wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no guarantee that the Corps will exercise its discretion to release or hold back water at a particular time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 69.  But as the United States has explained, increased streamflow into Lake Seminole (that is, increased Basin Inflow) \xe2\x80\x9cwould generally benefit the ACF system by delaying the onset of drought operations, by allowing the Corps to meet the 5000 cfs minimum flow longer during extended drought, and by quickening the resumption of normal operations after drought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28 (Aug. 7, 2017).  And our reading of the record convinces us it is highly unlikely that the Corps will always reduce the flow in this way; it leads us to believe that, acting in accordance with the its own revised Master Manual, the Corps is likely to permit, and in some cases may be <i>required</i> to ensure that, material amounts of additional Flint water to flow through the Woodruff Dam and into the Apalachicola River.  At the very least, we believe that more proceedings are necessary to reach a definitive determination.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As an initial matter, the Master Manual makes clear that the amount of water the Corps will release turns in part on the amount of water stored in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Chattahoochee reservoirs.  See U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Master Manual, Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin, Florida and Georgia, App. A, pp. 7\xe2\x80\x934 to 7\xe2\x80\x935, 7\xe2\x80\x937.  More specifically, the amount of water storage in those reservoirs dictates whether the Corps is conducting one of two possible types of \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  These are technical terms.  See <i>id</i>., at 7\xe2\x80\x9314 to 7\xe2\x80\x9316.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d need not correspond to dry periods, nor need the term \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d refer to wet periods.  Rather their applicability depends in part upon the amount of water that is stored behind the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Chattahoochee dams.  As the United States explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98drought operations\xe2\x80\x99 refers to more conservative operations that [the Corps conducts, which] are intended to enable the Corps to preserve water and operate its reservoir projects more effectively as drought conditions arise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 9 (Aug. 7, 2017).  We therefore must clearly distinguish what the record tells us about the amount of extra water that could flow into Florida as a result of a consumption cap during each of these two distinct types of Corps operations.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">a</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Nondrought Operations</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When the Corps is conducting \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations,\xe2\x80\x9d the Master Manual requires the Corps to release into Florida all or some of any extra water that flows from the Flint River into Lake Seminole, where it will then flow through the Woodruff Dam.  See App. to Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2a (Aug. 7, 2017) (detailing Corps operational protocol).  As the United States has explained, when the total streamflow into Lake Seminole is between 5,000 and 10,000 cfs during \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations,\xe2\x80\x9d the following facts are true:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny additional basin inflow .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would generally be passed straight through to Florida.  If, for example, the conservation measures advocated by Florida as part of a consumption cap actually resulted in an increased flow in the Flint River of 2,000 cfs, <i>see</i> Pre-Filed Direct Testimony of David Sunding, Ph.\xc2\xa0D. at 44, Table 4, then flows into Florida would also increase by roughly that amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Post-Trial Brief 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (Dec. 15, 2016); see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18 (Aug. 7, 2017) (reaffirming that under these circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cflows in the Apalachicola would increase by the amount of increased Flint River flows\xe2\x80\x9d including during summer months).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As far as we can tell, under the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 current operational protocol, the Corps may remain in \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d even during the driest summer months of the driest years.  For example, in 2007 the Corps conducted \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d not only during late autumn, winter, and spring months, but also during the hottest summer and early autumn months \xe2\x80\x9cwhen streamflow is at its lowest.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Direct Testimony of Phillip Bedient \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb648\xe2\x80\x9353 (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f 2007\xe2\x80\x99s Basin Inflow were repeated today and Drought Operations were not triggered,\xe2\x80\x9d the Corps would have had 92 days of \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations,\xe2\x80\x9d including 19 days \xe2\x80\x9cduring summer and fall months, when streamflow was at its lowest\xe2\x80\x9d on which 100% of extra water resulting from a consumption cap would reach Florida).  We note that these 19 days fell during a period of severe drought in which no extra water (let alone 2,000 cfs of extra water) was flowing into Lake Seminole.  And, unsurprisingly, the same trend appears to be true in dry summer months of other years: all or some of the extra water that would result from a consumption cap would also pass through to Florida.  See, <i>e.g</i>., Ga. Exh. 949 (reporting streamflow data indicating several days in 2009 on which extra Flint River water would have passed through to Florida); Joint Exh. 128 (providing link to U.\xc2\xa0S. Geological Survey data indicating a similar trend based on streamflow into the Apalachicola River, including in 2016 and 2017).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">b</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Drought Operations</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d are different.  Again, whether the Corps must initiate drought operations is not a matter of discretion; it depends, as we have said, upon the total amount of water the Corps has stored behind the dams it controls along the Chattahoochee River.  The Master Manual requires that, when the total amount of water stored in pools behind the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Chattahoochee dams drops below a certain level, the Corps must reduce the amount of water it releases from the Woodruff Dam to 5,000 cfs, or, in instances of extreme low water levels in the storage pools, to 4,500 cfs.  Master Manual App. A, at 7\xe2\x80\x9314 to 7\xe2\x80\x9316.  Accordingly, if additional water were to flow into Lake Seminole from the Flint River while the Corps is in <i>drought operations</i>, the Corps, pursuant to its Master Manual, must reduce the flow of its controlled upstream Chattahoochee water in order to maintain a defined water level in the pools behind its Chattahoochee dams, and no more than 4,500 cfs or 5,000 cfs can flow beyond the Woodruff Dam regardless.  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even then, as we just said, the Corps must make certain that at least 4,500 cfs and more often 5,000 cfs flows though the Woodruff Dam.  And, if more water flows from the Flint into Lake Seminole, and if the Corps uses that water to keep the water level high in its Chattahoochee reservoirs, then there will be fewer days in which the Corps is conducting either \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cextreme drought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, there will be more \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d days where the Corps must pass most or all additional streamflow that exceeds 5,000 cfs through the Woodruff (because there will be more days, given the added Flint water, when its upstream Chattahoochee reservoirs are sufficiently high).  The United States adds that \xe2\x80\x9ca cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumption\xe2\x80\x9d could, among other things, generate increased streamflow that</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cwould provide a cushion during low-flow periods, so that it would be possible to maintain a flow rate of <i>greater than</i> 5,000 cfs for a longer period of time without any alteration of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Post-Trial Brief 18\xe2\x80\x9319 (Dec. 15, 2016)  (emphasis added); see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18 (Aug. 7, 2017) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We repeat this point with an example for purposes of clarity.  Assume the following: (1) that it is August 13 and the Corps is conducting \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) that as a result of a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumption, 2,000 cfs more water flows down the Flint and into Lake Seminole; and (3) that, consistent with the Master Manual, 5,000 cfs will flow from Lake Seminole, through the Woodruff Dam, and into Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River.  On these three assumptions in all likelihood, as the dissent points out, <i>no extra water </i>will flow into Florida.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But (and this \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d is key), the extra 2,000 cfs of water that flows into Lake Seminole on August 13 as a result of a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s from the Flint River water consumption will allow the Corps to store more water behind its upstream Chattahoochee dams (while still complying with the Master Manual\xe2\x80\x99s minimum release requirements).  And that fact means that the Corps is likely to remain in \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d for fewer days because whether the Corps remains in \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d depends upon the water level behind the Chattahoochee dams.  And the fewer days the Corps conducts \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations,\xe2\x80\x9d the more days the Corps, consistent with its Master Manual, will allow all (or some) of the 2,000 cfs extra water that would result from a consumption cap to flow through the Woodruff Dam and into Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River.  Again, record evidence makes clear that this is not a fanciful possibility.  For example, Florida points to record evidence that suggests a consumption cap could have prevented the Corps from entering drought operations in 2011\xe2\x80\x932012 without departing from the terms of its Master Manual. See, <i>e.g</i>., Florida Brief in Support of Exceptions 48\xe2\x80\x9349, and n.\xc2\xa012  (citing record evidence, including Ga. Exh. 924 and Fla. Exh. 811,  that the Special Master did not address  suggesting that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed consumption cap could have helped the Corps to \xe2\x80\x9cavoi[d] drought operations entirely\xe2\x80\x9d in 2011\xe2\x80\x932012 without departing from the Master Manual\xe2\x80\x99s requirements).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that, even when the Corps conducts its operations in accordance with the Master Manual, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed consumption cap would likely mean more water in the Apalachicola\xe2\x80\x94as much as 2,000 cfs more water when the Corps is conducting normal or \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations,\xe2\x80\x9d which could take place in dry periods, including the driest days of summer, and 500 cfs more on days when the Corps is conducting \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  And a cap would likely allow the Corps to conduct \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d (<i>i.e.</i>, reservoirs-sufficiently-full operations) more often as well.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We cannot agree with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to deny these conclusions.  To begin with, the dissent says that our conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cdepends on the premise that, during droughts, the natural streamflow into Florida is between \xe2\x80\x985,000 and 10,000 cubic feet per second.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 29.  If the dissent means by \xe2\x80\x9cdroughts\xe2\x80\x9d simply dry days, or summer days, then it is obviously wrong, for pursuant to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 Master Manual, the Corps must allow all or some of the 2,000 cfs extra water that would flow into Lake Seminole to continue through the Woodruff Dam into Florida during dry summer days when the Corps is <i>not</i> conducting \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  This was true, as the dissent concedes, even during 19 summer days in 2007, which was among the driest years in the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Or, does the dissent mean by \xe2\x80\x9cdroughts\xe2\x80\x9d days on which the Corps is conducting \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d?  If so, then we agree that on such days, the Corps will normally allow no more than 5,000 cfs to flow into Florida.  But, for the reasons just stated in the last few paragraphs, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed consumption cap\xe2\x80\x94which could result in as much as 2,000 extra cubic feet of water per second flowing from the Flint into Lake Seminole\xe2\x80\x94will mean (consistent with the testimony of the very Georgia expert that the dissent so frequently quotes) that there will be significantly fewer such days.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Is there a mistake then in the \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete example\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent offers to support its point?  See <i>post, </i>at 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  Invoking a hypothetical posed by Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert, the dissent says:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the natural flows in the Apalachicola River were 2,600 cubic feet per second, then the Corps would release 2,400 cubic feet per second from its [Chattahoochee] reservoirs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  And if a cap on Georgia[\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s Flint River consumption] increased the River\xe2\x80\x99s natural flow to 4,100 cubic feet per second, the Corps would release 900 cubic feet per second.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. In either case, the total flow on the Apalachicola River would remain the same: 5,000 cubic feet per second.  Thus, so long as the natural flows remain significantly less than 5,000 cubic feet per second, a cap on Georgia would only decrease the amount of water that the Corps releases from storage; it would not increase the overall amount of water flowing into the Apalachicola River.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (citing Bedient \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb645\xe2\x80\x9347).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If, however, a consumption cap causes 1,500 cfs extra water (from the Flint) to flow into Lake Seminole (as we assume Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed cap would), under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s example, the Corps will <i>reduce </i>(or \xe2\x80\x9coffset\xe2\x80\x9d) the amount of water it releases from its upstream Chattahoochee dams from 2,400 cfs to 900 cfs.  That is because 2,400 cfs minus 900 cfs is 1,500 cfs.  What happens to that 1,500 cfs extra water?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the Corps is in drought operations, the answer according to the Master Manual is that the Corps must store that water in its upstream Chattahoochee reservoirs.  And with that 1,500 cfs extra water each day, the water levels in those reservoirs will rise (or, at a minimum, deplete less rapidly) and allow the Corps to resume \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d more quickly.  The United States repeats precisely this point\xe2\x80\x94namely, when more water flows into Lake Seminole, it benefits Florida by \xe2\x80\x9cquickening the [Corps\xe2\x80\x99] resumption of normal [<i>i.e., \xe2\x80\x9c</i>nondrought\xe2\x80\x9d] operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28 (Aug. 7, 2017).  (That extra water also means that there will be more days when 5,000 cfs, rather than 4,500 cfs, flows from Lake Seminole into the Apalachicola River).  And it means, as no one denies, that on days when the Corps conducts \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought operations\xe2\x80\x9d (which, as Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s own expert report shows, occur even during dry summer months), more water will reach Florida when Florida needs it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What about the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s point that Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Dr. Bedient, said that the extra 2,000 cfs would mean more water for Florida \xe2\x80\x9conly 19 days \xe2\x80\x98during the summer and fall months when streamflow was at its lowest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d?  <i>Post,</i> at 30.<i> </i>Dr. Bediant\xe2\x80\x99s exact words, as the dissent points out, were that in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dry years (<i>e.g.</i>, 2007 and 2011), .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. even significant changes in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumptive use would lead to virtually no change in state-line flows during the low-flow months (<i>e.g.</i>, June, July, August, September).\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Bedient \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb648\xe2\x80\x9353.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At this point, in our view, the dissent has pointed to record evidence with which other record evidence conflicts.  It seems from record evidence, from the statements of the United States, from geological data, and from laws of mechanics, that 2,000 cfs extra water flowing into Lake Seminole when, in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations were not in effect\xe2\x80\x9d would have to mean more water in Florida.  <i>Post</i>, at 30.  And the dissent does not dispute that some of these days are in the summer.  <i>Ibid</i>.<i> </i>Our own check of the record reinforces the point.  In particular, data from the U.\xc2\xa0S. Geological Survey\xe2\x80\x99s website, which the parties entered into the record at Joint Exh. 128, indicates that between May 2016 and August 2016, streamflow into the Apalachicola River was above 6,000 cfs each day with the exception of two days: August 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016.  Nothing in the record suggests that the Corps was in drought operations during these days, and so it appears that under these conditions, any additional streamflow resulting from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s Flint River consumption would pass through into Florida.  However, without explicit findings, it is neither possible nor prudent for us in the first instance to read through this voluminous record and discover who is right on this matter of how much extra water there will be, when, and how much Florida would benefit from the extra water that there might be.  That is why we are sending this case back for more findings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, while the dissent suggests that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is incredibly odd to conclude that a Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s merits determination is \xe2\x80\x98premature\xe2\x80\x99 after a full trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 17, this Court has repeatedly concluded that remand is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d to resolve certain issues in an equitable apportionment case even where, as here, there has already been a \xe2\x80\x9clengthy trial at which both States presented extensive evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Colorado II, </i>467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313; see also <i>Wyoming</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>, 259 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456\xe2\x80\x93457 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence was taken\xe2\x80\x9d over the course of two years and presented to the Court two years later and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he case has been argued at bar three times\xe2\x80\x9d including because of the \xe2\x80\x9cimportance of some of the questions involved\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, we note that adequate factfinding is especially important where, as here, no interstate compact guides our inquiry or sets forth a congressionally ratified water allocation formula.  When such a compact exists, as it often does, our effort is relatively simple and focuses upon \xe2\x80\x9cdeclar[ing] rights under the Compact and enforc[ing] its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Nebraska</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citing <i>Texas</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 567); <i>id</i>., at 567\xe2\x80\x93568 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a compact, it is a law of the United States, and our first and last order of business is interpreting the compact\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, no compact guides our inquiry and it would appear to be important that we approach this complex controversy with the care and thoroughness that our precedent requires.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our final question is this: Would the amount of extra water that reaches the Apalachicola significantly redress the economic and ecological harm that Florida has suffered?  There is evidence indicating that the answer to the question is in the affirmative.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Allan \xc2\xb63d, 26, 67 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven relatively modest increases in flows\xe2\x80\x94on the order of 300 to 500 cfs during key periods of the year\xe2\x80\x94could reduce harm to the [Apalachicola Region\xe2\x80\x99s] ecosystem and halt the cycle that is leading to irreversible harm\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9c[g]reater increases could make even more dramatic improvements\xe2\x80\x9d); Updated PFDT of Patricia Glibert \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb65, 28\xe2\x80\x9332, 58\xe2\x80\x9360, and Table 1, Figs. 10, 19b; <i>supra</i>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (citing record evidence of benefits); see also 10 Tr. 2629:7\xe2\x80\x9315 (Kondolf) (detailing benefits of increasing streamflow from 5,000 to 7,000 cfs); 3 <i>id</i>., at 591:6\xe2\x80\x93593:4, 596:17\xe2\x80\x93598:1 (Allan).  But the Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report does not explicitly answer this question.  We consequently must remand the case to find the answer to this question (and others).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, in respect to the evidentiary questions at issue, the Master assumed that: (1) Florida has likely suffered harm as a result of decreased water flow into the Apalachicola River; (2) Florida has made some showing that Georgia, contrary to equitable principles, has taken too much water from the Flint River; and (3) Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s inequitable use of the water may have injured Florida, but more findings are needed.  And in light of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions, we conclude that: (4) an equity-based cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Flint River would likely lead to a material increase in streamflow from the Flint River into Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Apalachicola River; and (5) the amount of extra water that reaches the Apalachicola may significantly redress the economic and ecological harm that Florida has suffered.  Further findings, however, are needed on all of these evidentiary issues on remand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We add the following: The United States has made clear that the Corps will work to accommodate any determinations or obligations the Court sets forth if a final decree equitably apportioning the Basin\xe2\x80\x99s waters proves justified in this case.  It states in its brief here that if a decree results \xe2\x80\x9cin more water flowing to Florida .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. under existing Corps protocols, then the Corps would likely not need to change its operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28 (Aug. 7, 2017).  It has added that, in any event, a decree \xe2\x80\x9cwould necessarily form part of the constellation of laws to be considered by the Corps when deciding how best to operate the federal projects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 32.  And in issuing its revised Master Manual, the Corps stated that it would \xe2\x80\x9creview any final decision from the U.\xc2\xa0S. Supreme Court and consider any operational adjustments that are appropriate in light of that decision, including modifications to the then-existing [Master Manual], if applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record of Decision 18.  The United States has \xe2\x80\x9ccontinually asserted its preparedness to implement, in accordance with federal law, any [agreed-upon] comprehensive water allocation formula.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 4; see also Joint Exh. 124, at 6\xe2\x80\x9335.  And, of course, the Administrative Procedure Act requires the Corps to make decisions that are reasonable, <i>i.e</i>., not \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of dis- cretion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin excess of [the Corps\xe2\x80\x99] statutory jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d   \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We recognize that the Corps must take account of a variety of circumstances and statutory obligations when it allocates water.  New circumstances may require the Corps to revise its Master Manual or devote more water from the Chattahoochee River to other uses.  But, given the considerations we have set forth, we cannot agree with the Special Master that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinheren[t] discretio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d renders effective relief impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9cuncertain\xe2\x80\x9d or that meaningful relief is otherwise precluded.  Report 56, n.\xc2\xa038.  We cannot now say that Florida has \xe2\x80\x9cmerely some technical right\xe2\x80\x9d without \xe2\x80\x9ca corresponding benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Kansas I, </i>206 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109, or that an effort to shape a decree will prove \xe2\x80\x9ca vain thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Foster</i>, 146 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 101.  Ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ncertainties about the future\xe2\x80\x9d do not \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a basis for declining to fashion a decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Idaho II</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 1026.  And in this case, the record leads us to believe that, if necessary and with the help of the United States, the Special Master, and the parties, we should be able to fashion one.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We keep in mind what our prior decisions make clear: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The difficulties of drafting and enforcing a decree\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d do not necessarily provide a convincing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justification for us to refuse to perform the important function entrusted to us by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Idaho I, </i>444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 390, n.\xc2\xa07 (quoting <i>Nebraska</i> v. <i>Wyoming</i>, 325 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 616); see also <i>Idaho II</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1027 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the computation is complicated and somewhat technical, that fact does not prevent the issuance of an equitable decree\xe2\x80\x9d).  For this reason and the others we have discussed, we agree with Florida that it has made a legally sufficient showing as to the possibility of fashioning an effective remedial decree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We repeat, however, that Florida will be entitled to a decree only if it is shown that \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits of the [apportionment] substantially outweigh the harm that might result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Colorado I</i>, 459 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 187.  In assessing whether that showing has been made, the Master may find it  necessary to address in the first instance many of the evidentiary and legal questions the answers to which we have here assumed or found plausible enough to allow us to resolve the threshold remedial question.  In order to determine whether Florida can eventually prove its right to cap Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of Flint River waters, it may find it necessary for the Special Master to make more specific factual findings and definitive recommendations regarding such questions as: To what extent does Georgia take too much water from the Flint River?  To what extent has Florida sustained injuries as a result?  To what extent would a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water consumption increase the amount of water that flows from the Flint River into Lake Seminole?  To what extent (under the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 revised Master Manual or under reasonable modifications that could be made to that Manual) would additional water resulting from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water consumption result in additional streamflow in the Apalachicola River?  To what extent would that additional streamflow into the Apalachicola River ameliorate Florida\xe2\x80\x99s injuries?  The Special Master may make other factual findings he believes necessary and hold hearings (or take additional evidence) as he believes necessary.  Cf. <i>Colorado I</i>, 459 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190, n.\xc2\xa014.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consistent with the principles that guide our inquiry in this context, answers need not be \xe2\x80\x9cmathematically precise or based on definite present and future conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1026.  Approximation and reasonable estimates may prove \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to protect the equitable rights of a State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>And the answers may change over time.

Florida claims that such a cap would allow additional water to flow into the Apalachicola River and Bay, which would benefit Florida by alleviating certain ecological harms.  To prevail under our precedents, Florida must present clear and convincing evidence that its proposed cap will benefit Florida more than it harms Georgia.  See<i> Colorado </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 176, 187 (1982) (<i>Colorado I</i>).  The Special Master applied this balance-of-harms standard and, after presiding over a 1-month trial involving 40 witnesses and more than 2,000 exhibits, found that Florida had not met its burden.  Because that finding is well supported by the evidence, I would have over- ruled Florida\xe2\x80\x99s objections to the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report (Report) and denied Florida\xe2\x80\x99s request for relief.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the facts focuses on the geography of the relevant rivers and the failed compact negotiations between Florida and Georgia, but does not provide any details about the respective interests of Florida and Georgia or the extensive operations of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).  See <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x935.  Because these missing details are crucial to determining whether equitable relief is warranted, I will supply them.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case concerns Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of water in the Basin.  Spanning Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, the Basin consists of three rivers\xe2\x80\x94the Chattahoochee, the Flint, and the Apalachicola.  The Chattahoochee River starts in northern Georgia, just north of Atlanta, and flows southwest along the Alabama-Georgia border until it reaches Florida.  The Flint River starts east of the Chattahoochee, just south of Atlanta, and flows south until it reaches Florida.  The Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers meet at the border of Florida, forming Lake Seminole.  From Lake Seminole, the Apalachicola River flows south through the Florida panhandle and into the Gulf of Mexico at Apalachicola Bay.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both Georgia and Florida depend on Basin water.  The Chattahoochee River supplies most of the water for metropolitan Atlanta.  And the Flint River supplies most of the water for southern Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s large agricultural industry.  In Florida, the Apalachicola River sustains a unique ecosystem that is home to a number of species, including mussels, sturgeon, and tupelo trees.  Flows from the Apalachicola River (or River) also support the Apalachi- cola Bay (or Bay) ecosystem\xe2\x80\x94one of the most productive estuaries in the Northern Hemisphere.  The Apalachicola Bay\xe2\x80\x99s low-salinity and high-nutrient waters make it an extraordinarily productive habitat for oysters and other sea life.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although both Georgia and Florida depend on the Basin, the Florida portion of the Basin is significantly less populated and productive.  The Georgia portion has a population of more than 5 million and accounts for around $283 billion in gross regional product per year.  Direct Testimony of Robert Stavins 2, 16 (Stavins).  The Florida portion, by contrast, has a population of fewer than 100,000 people and generates around $2 billion in gross regional product per year.  <i>Id.,</i> at 17<i>.</i>  In relative terms, Georgia accounts for 98% of the population and 99% of the economic production.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida and Georgia are not the only stakeholders in the Basin.  The United States, through the Corps, operates five dams and four reservoirs on the Chattahoochee River.  Only the three northernmost dams can store significant amounts of water.  The two dams that are farthest south on the Chattahoochee\xe2\x80\x94the George W. Andrews Dam and the Jim Woodruff Dam\xe2\x80\x94cannot store an appreciable amount of water.  The Corps does not operate any dams on the Flint River, which flows unimpeded until it reaches the Jim Woodruff Dam at Lake Seminole.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Corps operates its dams as a unit.  It must do so in a way that achieves its congressionally authorized purposes, such as facilitating navigation, generating hydroelectric power, protecting the national defense, promoting recreation, maintaining the commercial value of riparian lands, and protecting the water supply for the surrounding metropolitan Atlanta area.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 342, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 77 (1939); River and Harbor Act of 1945,\n\n59Stat.\n17; <i>In\xc2\xa0re MDL-1824 Tri-State Water Rights Litigation</i>, 644 F.\xc2\xa03d 1160, 1167 (CA11 2011).  The Corps also must ensure compliance with other federal laws, including laws governing the conservation of fish and wildlife, the quality of water, and the protection of threatened and endangered species.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Endangered Species Act of 1973,\n\n16 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71531 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>; Flood Control Act of 1944,\n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7701 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>; Water Supply Act of 1958,\n\n43 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7390b.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given these numerous demands, the Corps has long relied on water-control manuals to guide its operations of the dams.  The current manual dictates the minimum amount of water that the Corps must provide to the Apalachicola River under various conditions.  Three vari- ables affect that minimum amount of water: the time of year, the amount of water in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 storage reservoirs, and the amount of additional water entering the Basin.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The manual is very complex, spanning 1,190 pages, but only a few provisions are relevant here.  The manual provides that, as a general rule, most additional water that enters the Basin will pass through to Florida via the Apalachicola River.  But, in certain circumstances, the Corps will artificially increase or decrease the amount of water that passes through to ensure that 5,000 cubic feet per second flows into the Apalachicola River.  For example, if the natural streamflow entering the Basin (Basin inflow) is less than 5,000 cubic feet per second, then the Corps will artificially augment the flow by releasing additional water from its reservoirs.  Or, if the amount of water in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 reservoirs falls below a certain amount, the Corps will trigger what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cdrought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  During drought operations, no matter how much water is entering the Basin, the Corps will generally release only 5,000 cubic feet per second into the Apa- lachicola River until its reservoirs are completely replenished.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 current manual reflects many lessons that it has learned over the past decade.  In March 2006, for example, the Corps created an interim operating plan, which set high flow requirements to protect endangered species in the Apalachicola River.  Direct Testimony of Wei Zeng 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (Zeng).  But those high flow requirements prevented the Corps from saving enough water during droughts to refill its reservoirs, putting all its other projects at risk.  <i>Id.,</i> at 45.  So the Corps switched to more storage-friendly rules.  <i>Id.,</i> at 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  In December 2006, the Corps modified its operating plan to require a portion of the water entering the Basin to be devoted to refilling the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 reservoirs.  <i>Id.,</i> at 46.  When this modification proved insufficient, the Corps created special rules for droughts, which saved even more water by decreasing the minimum flow into the Apalachicola River.  <i>Id.,</i> at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  Later, the Corps altered its operations to save still more water, by increasing the amount it could dedicate to refilling its reservoirs during nondroughts and lowering the threshold for triggering the special drought rules.  <i>Id.,</i> at 47; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11 (Brief for United States).  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 current manual is a product of this decade of trial and error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The current manual also reflects decades of litigation.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 first manual went into effect in 1958, and the Corps did not propose a new one until 1989.  As soon as it did, Alabama sued.  Florida, Georgia, and other stakeholders eventually sued as well.  For its part, Florida alleged that the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operations under the proposed manual and subsequent interim operating plans violated the Endangered Species Act by injuring mussels and sturgeon, as well as noncovered species like oysters and tupelo trees.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The various lawsuits were eventually consolidated in the Middle District of Florida.  Twenty years after Alabama first sued, the District Court ruled for Alabama but against Florida.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed with respect to Alabama.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re MDL-1824 Tri-State Water Rights Litigation</i>, 644 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1192, 1205.  And Florida\xe2\x80\x99s case became moot in 2012, once the Corps issued the immediate predecessor to its current manual.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Soon after the litigation against the Corps ended, Florida sought leave to file this lawsuit against Georgia, requesting an equitable apportionment of Basin water.  This Court granted Florida leave to file its complaint in 2014.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s complaint alleged that Georgia was consuming more than its fair share of water in the Basin, causing economic and ecological harms to Florida.  Florida sought relief only against Georgia and disclaimed seeking any \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative relief against the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operation of the federally authorized dam and reservoir system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb615.  The United States could not be joined as a party because it declined to waive its sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Georgia moved to dismiss Florida\xe2\x80\x99s complaint for failure to join the United States as a necessary party.  Florida opposed the motion, arguing that the United States was not necessary because Florida \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ha[d] no quarrel\xe2\x80\x99 with the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operation of dams, and [its] lawsuit is not seeking to impose a \xe2\x80\x98minimum flow\xe2\x80\x99 regime on the Corps.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 26.  Florida reiterated that it \xe2\x80\x9cis not seeking any relief whatsoever with respect to the operations of the dams\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cnot seeking any relief asking the Corps to control the dams or pull the levers in any specific way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. on Motion to Dismiss 27.  Florida conceded that \xe2\x80\x9cif [the Special Master] conclude[s] after a trial that caps on [Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s] consumption will not redress Florida\xe2\x80\x99s harm, then Florida will not have proved its case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 29.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Based on Florida\xe2\x80\x99s concessions, the Special Master denied Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  The Special Master recognized that Florida had \xe2\x80\x9cdisclaimed any intention to seek a decree\xe2\x80\x9d binding the Corps in order to \xe2\x80\x9csideste[p] the need to join the United States as a party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order on Motion to Dismiss, p.\xc2\xa012.

Florida sought to cap Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of Basin water at its current levels through at least 2050.  See Florida Pre-trial Brief 5; Updated Pre-Filed Direct Testimony (PFDT) of Dr. George M. Hornberger 58 (Hornberger).  And, during drought years, Florida sought to reduce Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use of Basin water by between 1,500 and 2,000 cubic feet per second.  See Florida Pre-trial Brief 5; Hornberger 58; Updated PFDT of David Sunding 42 (Sunding); Florida Post-Trial Brief 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To support its proposed caps, Florida first presented testimony about how much additional water it would receive during droughts.  According to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, Georgia is currently using enough water during droughts to decrease streamflow on the Apalachicola River by around 4,000 cubic feet per second.  See Hornberger 2.  Florida proposed cutting that amount by half.  One of its experts opined that, by implementing several conservation measures, Georgia could increase flows in the Apalachicola River during droughts by 1,500 to 2,000 cubic feet per second.  See Sunding 3; Hornberger 4. Florida estimated that these measures would cost Georgia an additional $35.2 million per year.

It argued that additional flows could benefit mussels, which need consistent flows of at least 6,000 cubic feet per second in the summer; sturgeon, which need consistent flows of at least 7,000 cubic feet per second in the summer; and tupelo trees, which need consistent flows of at least 14,100 cubic feet per second in the summer.

Additional flows could also benefit the oysters in the Apalachicola Bay by lowering its salinity.  See Updated PFDT of J. Wilson White 48 (White); PFDT of Marcia Greenblatt 15.  All of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s evidence about these species, however, addressed the benefits of additional water during droughts.  See Report 63.  Florida presented no evidence of any benefits during nondroughts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Florida attempted to prove that the additional water would actually reach Florida when it needs the water\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>during droughts.  To do this, Florida needed to show that the Corps would deviate from its normal operating protocols, which specify that the Corps will generally release only 5,000 cubic feet per second during droughts.  Florida relied on Dr. Peter Shanahan to make this showing.  Dr. Shanahan testified that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corps would not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. hold back water and thwart the additional flow benefits [that] Florida would receive from Georgia[\xe2\x80\x99s] conservation efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Updated PFDT of Dr. Peter Shanahan 1 (Nov. 15, 2016).  He reasoned that the Corps would either choose to release the additional water in its discretion or be compelled to release the additional water because its upstream dams have limited storage capacity and it does not operate any dams on the Flint River.  <i>Id</i>., at 17\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In its defense, Georgia presented evidence that its current use has only a negligible impact on the amount of water that Florida receives through the Apalachicola River.  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s experts showed that the State\xe2\x80\x99s water use amounted to just 4% of Basin flows in an average year and 8% of Basin flows in a dry year, leaving anywhere from 92% to 96% of Basin water for Florida.  See Stavins 16\xe2\x80\x9318; Bedient 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  According to Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s experts, the primary factor that dictates flows in the Apalachicola River is precipitation, not consumption.  See Direct Testimony of Charles A. Menzie 15.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s experts also testified that Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use was entirely reasonable.  Metropolitan Atlanta had taken substantial steps to conserve water, reducing its consumption to levels that even Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert admitted demonstrated effective water conservation.  Direct Testimony of Peter Mayer 2; see also, <i>id.,</i> at 18 (showing that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Basin residents used more water per capita than residents in metropolitan Atlanta).  And, instead of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of 4,000 cubic feet per second, Georgia estimated that its water use had never decreased streamflow by more than 2,000 cubic feet per second, and only rarely by more than 1,400 cubic feet per second.  See Zeng 2, 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Georgia also presented evidence that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed caps would cost Georgia significantly more than they would benefit Florida.  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s economic expert estimated that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed caps would impose costs of more than \xe2\x80\x9c$2.1 billion for municipal and industrial water users and $335 million for Georgia farmers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. every single year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stavins 2.  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert also testified that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert had dramatically lowered his initial evaluation of the costs to Georgia, which was initially $191 million.  <i>Id.,</i> at 31; see also 11 Trial Tr. 2787.  That change apparently occurred because Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert narrowed his definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccost\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude anything but additional, direct governmental expenditures.  See <i>id</i>., at 2791.  But regardless of the precise cost, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert testified that it would be inequitable to impose it on Georgia.  \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgia has 5 times the land area, 56 times the population, 80 times the number of employees, and 129 times the [gross regional product] of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Florida. [Yet it] consumes only 4 percent of the total waters available in the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Basin in an average year, and only 8 percent of the total waters available in the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Basin in a dry year, leaving the rest for Florida\xe2\x80\x99s use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stavins 2.  Further, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s own expert estimated that a cap on Georgia would produce only minimal benefits for Florida: Cutting Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use in half would increase the oyster biomass in Apalachicola Bay by less than 0.6% in most instances, and only 1.2% during the worst droughts.  White 50\xe2\x80\x9351.  These additional oysters would be worth only a few hundred thousand dollars.  Stavins 51\xe2\x80\x9352.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Georgia rebutted Florida\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that, despite the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operations, Florida would actually receive the additional water that a cap on Georgia would create during droughts.  Using models that accounted for the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 prior operations, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert on the Corps, Dr. Philip Bedient, testified that Florida would receive only 5,000 cubic feet per second during droughts, no matter how much additional water was created by a cap on Georgia and regardless of whether that water flowed into the Flint or the Chattahoochee River.  See Bedient 23\xe2\x80\x9326, 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  The United States filed an <i>amicus</i> brief to the same effect.  It confirmed that, during droughts, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Corps expects .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that Apalachicola River flows would be very similar with or without a consumption cap [on Georgia].\xe2\x80\x9d  Post-Trial Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (United States Post-Trial Brief).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">All told, the trial lasted one month.

To prove standing, a complaining State must demonstrate that it has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98suffered a wrong through the action of the other State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which is susceptible of judicial enforcement according to the acceptable principles of the common law or equity systems of jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maryland</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 735\xe2\x80\x93736; <i>Wyoming</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 452.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, this Court requires the State seeking an apportionment to show by clear and convincing evidence a \xe2\x80\x9cthreatened invasion of rights .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of serious magnitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>New York </i>v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n256 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, 309 (1921); accord, <i>Colorado I</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 187, n.\xc2\xa013; Kelley \xc2\xa745.04.  Our precedents do not clarify whether this requirement goes to the case\xe2\x80\x99s justiciability, the merits of the complaining State\xe2\x80\x99s claim, or the propriety of affording injunctive relief.  See <i>ibid.</i>  But they are clear that such a showing must be made to obtain relief.  See <i>Connecticut </i>v. <i>Massachusetts</i>,\n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 660, 669 (1931).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the State seeking an apportionment must \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[e] by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits of the [apportionment] substantially outweigh the harm that might result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Colorado I</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 187; accord, <i>Colorado </i>v. <i>New Mexico</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310, 316\xe2\x80\x93317 (1984) (<i>Colorado II</i>); Kelley \xc2\xa745.06, at 45\xe2\x80\x9334 to 45\xe2\x80\x9335.  Since this Court\xe2\x80\x99s first equitable-apportionment case, this balance-of-harms test has been the basic merits inquiry that decides whether a State is entitled to an apportionment.  See <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa745.06(c)(1), at 45\xe2\x80\x9339 to 45\xe2\x80\x9340 (\xe2\x80\x9cHarm-benefit comparison goes back to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first equitable apportionment case, <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Colorado</i>[,\n\n206 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46, 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (1907) (<i>Kansas I</i>)]\xe2\x80\x9d).  As part of the balance-of-harms test, this Court has required the State seeking an apportionment to prove that it would appreciably benefit from the apportionment\xe2\x80\x94otherwise, the State could not possibly prevail in the balance-of-harms analysis.  <i>Idaho I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 392; <i>Washington</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 523; see also Kelley \xc2\xa745.06(c)(1), at 45\xe2\x80\x9339 (explaining that this appreciable-benefit requirement is part of the \xe2\x80\x9charm-benefit\xe2\x80\x9d balance).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, if the State seeking an apportionment makes all these showings, this Court must craft an equitable-apportionment decree.  Our precedents hold that a State should not be denied a remedy merely because calculating the appropriate apportionment is difficult.  See <i>Idaho ex\xc2\xa0rel. Evans </i>v. <i>Oregon</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1017, 1026 (1983) (<i>Idaho II</i>).  Reasonable predictions about future conditions are sufficient.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case is about the third rule: the balance-of-harms analysis and, specifically, its appreciable-benefit requirement.  The Special Master found that Florida had not proved that its requested cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use would appreciably benefit it, since Florida could not prove that it would receive more water when it needed it.  That this case is about the third rule is important.  Throughout its opinion, the Court mushes the requirements from our precedents together, merging cases and principles from one area with cases and principles from another\xe2\x80\x94sometimes in the same sentence.  But our precedents are not so convoluted.  They articulate clear rules, and the Special Master correctly applied one of them when making his recommendation in this case.  He did not err by failing to apply the unrecognizable mishmash of principles set out in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida raises three objections to the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report.  First, it argues that the Special Master required it to satisfy a legal standard that was too demanding.  Second, Florida argues that it should prevail under the correct standard because, if this Court enters an equitable-apportionment decree, the Corps will likely allow more water to flow into Florida during droughts.  And third, even if the Corps does not release more water into Florida during droughts, Florida argues that a cap on Georgia would still benefit it during nondroughts.  None of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida\xe2\x80\x99s first objection fails because the Special Master applied the correct legal standard.  A careful reading of his Report demonstrates that he applied the ordinary balance-of-harms test dictated by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  He did not, as the Court implies, deny Florida relief because calculating an appropriate apportionment was too difficult or because Florida failed to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d redressability requirement for Article III standing.  And even if the Special Master did apply the wrong standard, his misstep would not justify a remand because his findings are plainly correct and establish that Georgia should prevail under the balance-of-harms test.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Special Master applied the balance-of-harms test from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.

It also reflects \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court\xe2\x80\x99s long-held view that the proposed diverter should bear most, if not all, of the risks of erroneous decision\xe2\x80\x9d because the benefits he claims for proposed future uses are usually \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speculative and remote\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d while the costs of disrupting established uses are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98typically certain and immediate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Colorado I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 187).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As part of the balance-of-harms analysis, this Court has repeatedly held that the State seeking to divert water from existing uses must show that it will obtain some appreciable benefit from an equitable apportionment.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Idaho I</i>, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392; <i>New Jersey</i>, 283 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 345.  This appreciable-benefit requirement reflects the fact that a minimal benefit cannot outweigh the heavy costs that inevitably accompany equitable-apportionment decrees.  See <i>Colorado I</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 187 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he equities supporting the [status quo] will usually be compelling\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Kansas II</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 393 (expressing \xe2\x80\x9cgreat and serious caution\xe2\x80\x9d over granting equitable apportionments because they \xe2\x80\x9cinterfer[e] with the action of a State\xe2\x80\x9d).

But the Special Master nowhere contradicted this rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rule from <i>Idaho II </i>is a rule about fashioning an appropriate remedy when the complaining State has prevailed on the merits.  In <i>Idaho II</i>, the Special Master concluded that he could not determine Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to fish \xe2\x80\x9cfor any past or future year\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cseveral unknown variables\xe2\x80\x9d made it too difficult to decide how many fish would be available to harvest at any given time.  Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report, O. T. 1982, No. 67, Orig., p.\xc2\xa030.  The Special Master rejected Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s proposed formula for calculating its entitlement because he could not understand the predictive models or mathematics involved in applying it.  <i>Id.,</i> at 40\xe2\x80\x9342.  Before this Court, Idaho objected to the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, arguing that its proposed formula relied on procedures \xe2\x80\x9cthat are either being currently employed by defendants or which involve simple mathematical computations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Plaintiffs in O. T. 1982, No. 67, Orig., p.\xc2\xa082.  The Court accepted Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s argument, noting that a decree need not \xe2\x80\x9calways be mathematically precise or based on definite present and future conditions\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cIdaho\xe2\x80\x99s proposed formula for apportioning the fish is one possible basis for a decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Idaho II</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 1026.  \xe2\x80\x9cUncertainties about the future,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not provide a basis for declining to fashion a decree.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the Special Master in <i>Idaho II</i>, the Special Master in this case did not conclude that it was too difficult to calculate the amount of water that Florida should receive.  As the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at 23, the Special Master assumed it was feasible to impose Florida\xe2\x80\x99s requested cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use and \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed] Florida\xe2\x80\x99s estimates of the increased streamflow that would result from a consumption cap.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report 67, n. 43; see <i>id.</i>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  But even if a cap on Georgia generated the additional water that Florida claimed it would (1,500 to 2,000 cubic feet per second), the Special Master concluded that it would not appreciably benefit Florida because it would not be passed through when Florida needed it.  See <i>id.</i>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348, 62\xe2\x80\x9365, 69.  That is why the Special Master cited the appreciable-benefit rule from <i>Idaho I</i>, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392, and <i>Washington</i>, 297 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 523.  He did not fail to make reasonable predictions in shaping a remedy or otherwise contravene the rule from <i>Idaho II</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">b</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida alternatively contends that the Special Master applied the \xe2\x80\x9credressability\xe2\x80\x9d requirement of Article III standing.  See Brief for Plaintiff 29\xe2\x80\x9332.  At some points, the Court appears to agree with this characterization, as it describes the appreciable-benefit rule as an Article III standing requirement.  See <i>ante, </i>at 13 (quoting the Article III standing rule from <i>Wyoming</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i>, 502 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 447, 452, <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, 451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 735\xe2\x80\x93736, and <i>Massachusetts </i>v. <i>Missouri</i>,\n\n308 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 15 (1939), and describing the appreciable-benefit rule from <i>Kansas I</i> and <i>Washington</i> as a \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ore specifi[c]\xe2\x80\x9d articulation of that rule).  This argument is incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As explained, the Special Master applied the ordinary balance-of-harms analysis and found that Florida had not demonstrated an appreciable benefit from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use.  Tellingly, the Special Master relied exclusively on cases conducting the balance-of-harms analysis.  His Report does not cite any standing cases, or even mention \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cArticle III.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neither do any of the pre-trial or post-trial briefs that the parties filed.  True, the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report sometimes describes the appreciable-benefit requirement as a question of \xe2\x80\x9credressability\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a word that is also associated with Article III standing.  But the Special Master was merely following the parties\xe2\x80\x99 lead, as they phrased the appreciable-benefit requirement in terms of \xe2\x80\x9credress\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the litigation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. on Motion to Dismiss 29 (Florida admitting that it must show \xe2\x80\x9cthat caps on consumption will .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. redress [its] harms\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprov[e] its case\xe2\x80\x9d); Florida Pre-Trial Brief 37\xe2\x80\x9339 (describing how a consumption cap \xe2\x80\x9ccan redress Florida\xe2\x80\x99s worsening injuries\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly benefit Florida\xe2\x80\x99s ecology\xe2\x80\x9d); Georgia Post-Trial Brief 80\xe2\x80\x9388 (describing the appreciable-benefit aspect of the balance-of-harms test as a \xe2\x80\x9credress\xe2\x80\x9d requirement); Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s Post-Trial Response Brief 3, 7 (same); see also United States Post-Trial Brief 19 (taking no position \xe2\x80\x9con whether Florida has proved that a consumption cap would produce enough additional [B]asin inflow at the right times to <i>redress</i> Florida\xe2\x80\x99s alleged harm and justify the cost of imposing a consumption cap\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  That the parties and the Special Master adopted this shorthand does not change the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, which focused squarely on the appreciable-benefit requirement.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">c</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the Court wrongly assumes that the Special Master denied relief on the basis rejected in <i>Idaho II </i>or for lack of Article III standing, it faults the Special Master for imposing the higher burden of proof that governs the merits\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante,</i> at 15\xe2\x80\x9318.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Of course, the far simpler explanation for why the Special Master applied the merits standard is that he was, in fact, making a decision about the merits, not about remedies or standing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also appears to fault the Special Master for addressing the appreciable-benefit requirement without first making several preliminary findings.  The Court asserts that Special Masters must make specific factual determinations in every case about the harm that the complaining State suffered, the exact amount of water needed to remedy that harm, and a host of other factors.  See <i>ante,</i> at 13\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggested order of operations, which it appears to invent out of thin air, would fundamentally transform our equitable-apportionment jurisprudence.  It will require States to litigate (and this Court to resolve) a host of complex factual questions, even where the State seeking the apportionment is obviously not entitled to relief because it cannot show an appreciable benefit\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that Florida agrees is necessary for it to prevail, see Florida Post-Trial Response Brief 63 (agreeing it must \xe2\x80\x9cprove that additional flows from a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reduction in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumption will result in meaningful benefits to the Bay and River\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. on Motion to Dismiss 29 (admitting it must show \xe2\x80\x9cthat caps on consumption will .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. redress [its] harms\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprov[e] its case\xe2\x80\x9d).  In no other area of the law do we require unnecessary findings and conclusions when a key element of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case is missing.  And we have not applied this rule in equitable apportionment cases either.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Idaho II</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 1027\xe2\x80\x931029 (denying relief, despite the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous ruling on the requested remedy, because his findings also supported the conclusion that Idaho could not show injury and thus was not entitled to relief on the merits).  The inefficiencies that this would create, and the costs it would impose on States, are obvious.  Yet the Court faults the Special Master for resolving the dispositive question in this case first, without jumping through a series of unnecessary hoops.  This is precisely the opposite of what Special Masters should be doing and what this Court should be encouraging.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the Court is correct that the Special Master denied Florida relief for some reason other than the merits, there is no reason to send this case back for a do-over.  As the Court acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the ultimate responsibility for deciding what are correct findings of fact remains with us.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9319<i> </i>(<i>Colorado II</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 317).  We \xe2\x80\x9cmust bring our independent judgment to bear based upon \xe2\x80\x98our own independent examination of the record.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Missouri</i>,\n\n322 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213, 232 (1944).  An independent examination of the record confirms that the Special Master was correct to find that the Corps would not change its operations during droughts if this Court capped Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use and thus Florida would not benefit from a cap during droughts.  See Part IV\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931, <i>infra</i>.  The Special Master also was correct to find that Florida presented no evidence of a benefit during nondroughts.  See Part IV\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, <i>infra</i>.  Those findings support a judgment in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s favor under the traditional balance-of-harms analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It makes little sense to send this case back to the Special Master so that he can amend his Report to say \xe2\x80\x9cappreciable benefit\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9credress\xe2\x80\x9d and then send this case right back to this Court.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  That pointless exercise will only needlessly prolong this litigation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s subtle suggestion that Florida could present \xe2\x80\x9cadditional evidence\xe2\x80\x9d on remand, <i>ante,</i> at 36, is not a satisfactory response.  During their 18 months of discovery, the parties produced 7.2 million pages of documents, served 130 third-party subpoenas, issued more than 30 expert reports, and conducted nearly 100 depositions, including 29 expert depositions.  Florida thus had a more-than-ample opportunity to gather its evidence and then present it at a 1-month trial.  Giving Florida another bite at the apple will likely yield no additional evidence, but it will be unfair to Georgia, which has already spent the time and resources to defeat the case that Florida chose to present.  In short, we have all the evidence we need to decide this case now.  We should have done so. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida\xe2\x80\x99s second and third objections\xe2\x80\x94which challenge the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Florida had not met its burden under the balance-of-harms test\xe2\x80\x94also fail.  As explained, a State seeking to interfere with established uses must prove its case by clear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cmuch greater\xe2\x80\x9d burden than the one normally imposed in civil cases.  <i>Connecticut</i>, 282 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 669.  To meet this burden, Florida must present enough evidence to leave this Court with an \xe2\x80\x9cabiding conviction that the truth of its factual contentions are \xe2\x80\x98highly probable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cinstantly til[t] the evidentiary scales in the affirmative when weighed against the evidence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. offered in opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Colorado II</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 316.  As the Special Master found, Florida has not met this burden.  The evidence demonstrates that, if this Court imposed Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed cap on Georgia, Florida would not receive an appreciable amount of additional water during droughts.  And Florida would not benefit from the additional water that it received during nondroughts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Florida did not demonstrate that, if this Court caps Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use, Florida would receive a meaningful amount of additional water during droughts.  For Florida to receive more water, the Corps must change its current operating procedures.  But the Corps is not a party, and it would not be bound by any decree issued by this Court.  Because Florida cannot ask this Court to require the Corps to change its existing operations, it must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Corps will voluntarily make the necessary changes.  Florida cannot do so.  The United States\xe2\x80\x99 representations in this litigation and the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 history and practice in the Basin all reveal that the Corps will not change its existing practices, even if this Court caps Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Throughout this litigation, the United States has consistently maintained that the Corps \xe2\x80\x9cwould not generally expect\xe2\x80\x9d to release more water into Florida during droughts, even if Florida convinced this Court to cap Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use.  Brief for United States 28; see also United States Post-Trial Brief 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Corps expects [during drought operations] that Apalachicola River flows would be very similar with or without a consumption cap until enough water is stored to return the system to normal operations\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is because \xe2\x80\x9c[B]asin inflow .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. has historically not been the primary factor in the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 decisionmaking process for making additional releases above 5[,]000 [cubic feet per second] during drought operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 28.  The Corps\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9coverriding\xe2\x80\x9d priorities during droughts are preserving enough water \xe2\x80\x9cto comply with the [Endangered Species Act] while avoiding catastrophic depletion of storage and refilling [its] reservoirs as rapidly as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 27.  Deviations are made only \xe2\x80\x9cas needed to serve congressionally authorized project purposes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin emergency circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Since a general need to provide more water to Florida does not fall within either exception, the additional water that would flow into the Basin would not translate into additional flows for Florida.  See <i>id.,</i> at 29.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The United States\xe2\x80\x99 representations are consistent with the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 historical practice.  During droughts, the amount of water entering the Basin is almost always insufficient to meet the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 minimum-flow requirement of 5,000 cubic feet per second.  See Bedient 24\xe2\x80\x9327.  Thus, a cap on Georgia would simply decrease the amount of water that the Corps must release from storage; it would not increase the amount of water flowing into the Apalachicola River.  <i>Id.,</i> at 21, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  And once drought operations are triggered, the Corps limits its releases to around 5,000 cubic feet per second regardless of the amount of water entering the Basin.  See United States Post-Trial Brief 9; Brief for United States 24\xe2\x80\x9328.  Indeed, during past drought operations, even when Basin inflow varied by tens of thousands of cubic feet per second, the measured flow from Jim Woodruff Dam into the Apalachicola River has consistently remained around 5,000 cubic feet per second.  See Bedient 23, 62\xe2\x80\x9363.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  Further, the models presented by Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert showed that, if Florida\xe2\x80\x99s proposed caps had been in place during the drought years of 2007 and 2012, Florida would not have received appreciable additional flows when the water was most needed.  Cutting Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use in half would have produced additional flows for only 14 to 19 days in the summer and fall of 2007, and would not have produced any additional flows during the summer or fall of 2012.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27\xe2\x80\x9330; see also <i>id.,</i> at 38 (showing the same for 2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida argues that the Corps might exercise its discretion to ensure that additional water reaches Florida during droughts.  Brief for Plaintiff 40\xe2\x80\x9344.  But Florida supports this claim with nothing more than speculation.  See <i>Colorado II</i>, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 320 (explaining that a State cannot carry its burden in an equitable-apportionment action except \xe2\x80\x9cwith specific evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ere assertions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will not do\xe2\x80\x9d).  All available evidence suggests that the Corps would not exercise its discretion to release more water into the Apalachicola River during droughts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before this Court, the United States expressly rejected Florida\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corps is likely to exercise its authority within existing operational protocols to provide Florida with additional flows produced by a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 23.  Basin inflows, it explained, simply do not dictate how much water the Corps releases into the Apalachicola River.  <i>Ibid. </i> And the Corps could not make discretionary releases \xe2\x80\x9cthat [are] not specifically provided for in the [water-control manual], not specifically authorized by Congress or mandated by general statute, [and not] required by a court order directed to the Corps,\xe2\x80\x9d without raising \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and difficult question[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about whether it had exceeded its authority.  <i>Id.,</i> at 29.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida also suggests that the Corps might amend its water-control manual in response to an equitable decree from this Court.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s only support for this argument is a statement from the Corps that it will \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98take .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into account\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Brief for Plaintiff 44 (quoting Record of Decision Adopting Proposed Action Alternative for Implementation of Updated Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin Master Manual 18 (Mar. 30, 2017)).  But this vague statement was not a promise that the Corps will change its procedures, and there are a host of reasons to doubt that the Corps would voluntarily change its procedures just because this Court capped Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For one, the Corps has already tried procedures that passed more water to Florida during droughts.  The results were dreadful: Reservoir storage plummeted to dangerously low levels, putting all of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 authorized project purposes at risk.  Zeng 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Since that time, the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operating protocols have become increasingly protective of reservoir storage, particularly during droughts.  As the Corps explained, it intends to pursue \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a more proactive approach to conserve reservoir storage as drier conditions develop in the [B]asin\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because the \xe2\x80\x9c[s]torage of water during drought operations is critically important to retain sufficient water in the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another, the last time the Corps attempted to change its water-control manual, it required more than two decades of litigation and administrative review to finalize those changes.  Indeed, the main reason that the United States chose not to participate in this case is because it wanted \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid being bound by a decree that could directly affect the Corps operations before the Corps had a chance to finally complete its process of updating the [water-control manual].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 32.  Given this, there is no reason to think that the Corps will volunteer to undertake the process of updating its manual again\xe2\x80\x94especially so soon after it completed this arduous task.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida\xe2\x80\x99s speculation is even more suspect in view of the changes that the Corps would have to make to benefit Florida during droughts.  To even propose a new water-control manual, the Corps must \xe2\x80\x9cexamin[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the congressionally authorized purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. how providing additional flows will impact those purposes [and] other laws,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csupplemen[t] documentation of environmental impacts as required by [the National Environmental Policy Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 31.  Providing more water to Florida does not help the Corps satisfy any of these legal requirements.  It is not one of the congressionally authorized purposes, see <i>id.,</i> at 29, 31\xe2\x80\x9332, and, by dropping its lawsuit against the Corps, Florida now accepts that a minimum flow of 5,000 cubic feet per second is sufficient to comply with the Endangered Species Act.  Florida cannot claim that the law requires the Corps to provide it with more water.  And the idea that the Corps will change its operating protocols to serve an unauthorized purpose when doing so could jeopardize its authorized purposes is simply not plausible.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Taking a different tack, the Court suggests that additional water will pass through to Florida even if the Corps does not change its manual.  Specifically, the Court concludes that the additional water will pass through to Florida during droughts so long as the Corps does not enter drought operations.  See <i>ante, </i>at 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  According to the Court, the Corps will allow additional water to pass through to Florida whenever the natural flow of the Apalachicola River is between 5,000 and 10,000 cubic feet per second during normal or \xe2\x80\x9cnondrought\xe2\x80\x9d operations.  See <i>ante, </i>at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion depends on the premise that, during droughts, the natural streamflow into Florida is \xe2\x80\x9cbetween 5,000 and 10,000\xe2\x80\x9d cubic feet per second.  <i>Ibid.</i>  That premise is false.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  During droughts, the natural streamflow in the Apalachicola River is usually less than 5,000 cubic feet per second.  <i>Supra,</i> at 25; see also Bedient 23 (showing that Basin inflow in 2012 was generally below 5,000 cubic feet per second between June and December); <i>id.,</i> at 27 (same for 2007).  To maintain a minimum flow of 5,000 cubic feet per second during droughts, the Corps must artificially augment the River\xe2\x80\x99s natural flow\xe2\x80\x94even when the Corps is in nondrought operations.  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  For instance, during the 2011 drought (when the Corps was in nondrought operations), \xe2\x80\x9cBasin Inflow was below 5,000 [cubic feet per second] for most of th[e] period [between June and December], and the Corps was \xe2\x80\x98augmenting\xe2\x80\x99 streamflow by releasing water from the reservoirs to satisfy the 5,000 [cubic feet per second] minimum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 15; see also <i>id.,</i> at 27 (same for 2007).  Once the Corps adds enough water to reach 5,000 cubic feet per second, however, it generally adds no more than that.  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.  To give a concrete example, if the natural flows in the Apalachicola River were 2,600 cubic feet per second, then the Corps would release 2,400 cubic feet per second from its reservoirs.  See <i>id.,</i> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  And if a cap on Georgia increased the River\xe2\x80\x99s natural flow to 4,100 cubic feet per second, the Corps would release 900 cubic feet per second.  See <i>ibid.</i>  In either case, the total flow on the Apalachicola River would remain the same: 5,000 cubic feet per second.  Thus, so long as the natural flows remain significantly less than 5,000 cubic feet per second, a cap on Georgia would only decrease the amount of water that the Corps releases from storage; it would not increase the overall amount of water flowing into the Apalachicola River.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For this reason, even when the Corps is in nondrought operations, a cap on Georgia would generally not increase flows to Florida.  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert proved that fact with evidence about past droughts where drought operations were not in effect.  Using data from the 2007 drought, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s expert concluded that the additional water from a cap on Georgia would be passed through to Florida almost entirely during the winter and spring months \xe2\x80\x9cwhen water in the [Basin] would be relatively plentiful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 28.  Florida would receive the additional water from a cap on Georgia only 19 days \xe2\x80\x9cduring the summer and fall months, when streamflow was at its lowest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; accord, <i>id.,</i> at 40.  Data from the 2011 drought showed similar results.  See <i>id.,</i> at 37 (\xe2\x80\x9c[During] dry years (<i>e.g., </i>2007 and 2011), .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. even significant changes in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s consumptive use would lead to virtually no change in state-line flows during the low-flow months (<i>e.g., </i>June, July, August, September)\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  Florida has not shown that these infrequent and sporadic additional flows during droughts would appreciably benefit it.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court hypothesizes that a cap on Georgia could benefit Florida by decreasing the length of drought operations and by increasing the number of days that the Corps can meet its minimum-flow requirements of 5,000 cubic feet per second (during normal drought operations) and 4,500 cubic feet per second (during extreme drought operations).  <i>Ante</i>, at 24, 27\xe2\x80\x9329.  The Court cites the United States\xe2\x80\x99 assertion in its brief that increased Basin inflows \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would generally benefit the [Basin] system by delaying the onset of drought operations, by allowing the Corps to meet the 5000 [cubic feet per second] minimum flow longer during extended drought, and by quickening the resumption of normal operations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 24 (quoting Brief for United States 28); see also <i>ante</i>, at 28 (quoting a similar statement in the United States Post-Trial Brief 18\xe2\x80\x9319).  Of course, statements in briefs are not evidence.  And, as the United States recognizes in the very next sentence, Flor- ida would have to show that these \xe2\x80\x9cbenefits are of sufficient quantity to justify relief in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28 (Aug. 7, 2017); see also United States Post-Trial Brief 19 (Dec. 15, 2016) (taking \xe2\x80\x9cno position on whether Florida has proven that a consumption cap would produce enough additional [B]asin inflow at the right times to redress Florida\xe2\x80\x99s alleged harm and justify the cost of imposing a consumption cap\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida offered no proof that a cap on Georgia would produce any appreciable benefit of this kind.  And the evidence presented at trial suggests that these proposed benefits are wholly speculative.  As explained above, the benefits to Florida from a cap on Georgia do not meaningfully change, regardless of whether the Corps enters drought operations.  And there is no evidence that the Corps has had trouble meeting its minimum flow requirements during recent droughts, when Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use remained uncapped.  Even during the severe droughts of 2011 and 2012, the Corps consistently maintained flows of 5,000 cubic feet per second, never entered extreme drought operations, and never reduced flows on the Apa- lachicola River to 4,500 cubic feet per second.  See Bedient 14.  And the Corps is even more unlikely to run out of water during future droughts, given that its current manual is more proactive in conserving water during droughts.  See Brief for United States 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, Florida has not shown that it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98highly probable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that a cap on Georgia will result in meaningful additional flows in the Apalachicola River during droughts.  <i>Colorado II</i>, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 316.  It is thus not entitled to an equitable apportionment on this basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because Florida will not receive additional water during droughts, it argues that it will benefit from additional water during nondroughts.  As the Special Master correctly found, however, Florida presented no evidence to support such an assertion.  That is because no such evidence exists.  Florida would not benefit from additional water during nondroughts, because flows on the Apalachicola River during nondroughts are already plentiful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court does not contend that Florida would benefit from additional water during nondroughts, and Florida all but conceded the point below.  When framing its case before the Special Master, Florida requested only that the Court order Georgia to reduce its water use during droughts; Florida did not ask the Court to reduce Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s current water use during nondroughts.  See Florida Pre-trial Brief 5; Hornberger 58.  Consistent with this request, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s evidence focused exclusively on the harms that it suffered during droughts.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s hydrol- ogy expert testified extensively about droughts.  See <i>id</i>., at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 15\xe2\x80\x9326, 41\xe2\x80\x9346, 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  He testified that the Basin usually receives \xe2\x80\x9ca rather good amount of a rainfall,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9cmajor problems arise\xe2\x80\x9d only during \xe2\x80\x9cthe low rainfall years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 13.  That is why he limited his testimony to the \xe2\x80\x9cimpacts of [Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s] consumption during drought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 15; see also <i>id.</i>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Florida\xe2\x80\x99s other experts followed this drought-centric approach.  For instance, one of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s experts on the harm to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s oysters connected that harm to \xe2\x80\x9csevere drought,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9creduced the discharge of fresh water from the Apalachicola River.\xe2\x80\x9d  Updated PFDT of David Kimbro 14.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert on the harm to sturgeon, mussels, and tupelo trees in the Apalachicola River similarly emphasized \xe2\x80\x9cdry periods of episodically dry years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Allan 17; see also <i>id.</i>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327 (emphasizing the effects of sustained flows below 6,000 cubic feet per second).  As one Florida expert put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he discussions that [he] had, especially with the biologists and the hydrologists, were largely almost exclusively focused on dry years\xe2\x80\x9d and he \xe2\x80\x9cc[ould]n\xe2\x80\x99t think of any\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cissues [that] other experts raised about average or wet-year problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 Trial Tr. 2811.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The other evidence presented at trial leaves little doubt that Florida would not benefit from additional water during nondroughts.  For starters, when the Basin is not experiencing a drought, water is plentiful.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert testified that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]verage rainfall in the portion of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Basin above [Lake Seminole] is 51.5 inches per year, a rather good amount of a rainfall.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hornberger 13.  As a result, average monthly flows in the Apalachicola River are nearly 20,000 cubic feet per second.  Direct Testimony of Sorab Panday 30 (Panday).  More than 95% of the time, Apalachicola River flows exceed 6,000 cubic feet per second.  Brief for Unites States 12.  And it is not unusual for flows in the Apalachicola River to exceed 50,000 cubic feet per second in the wetter months.  See Panday 30.  Even during drought years, flows in nonsummer months are relatively high.  For instance, in the severe drought year of 2012, flow in the late winter and early spring regularly exceeded 10,000 cubic feet per second.  See Bedient 29.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Almost all of the additional water generated by a cap on Georgia would reach Florida during these high flow periods, when it would provide no benefit to Florida.  See <i>id.</i>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9330.  Take, for instance, the oysters in Apalachicola Bay\xe2\x80\x94the only harm to Florida that the Special Master found in this case.  See Report 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s own experts testified that, even if Georgia cut its agricultural water use in half during droughts, the resulting increase in Apalachicola River flows would have a negligible effect during nondroughts.  During years of normal rainfall and the wetter months of drought years, the effect of additional flows on the Bay\xe2\x80\x99s salinity is less than one part per thousand.  See 7 Trial Tr. 1768\xe2\x80\x931775.  This immeasurable effect on the Bay\xe2\x80\x99s salinity would have no appreciable impact on oyster biomass.  See White 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (showing a less than 0.6% impact on oyster biomass, except in drier months and drought years).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Assuming Florida\xe2\x80\x99s claims of harm to mussels, sturgeon, and tupelo trees have merit\xe2\x80\x94something the Special Master never found\xe2\x80\x94the harm to those species also would not be remedied by increased flows during nondroughts.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert on these species opined that significant harm to mussels occurs when flows drop below a threshold of 6,000 cubic feet per second for more than seven consecutive days between June 1 and September 30, Allan 33; that significant harm to sturgeons occurs when flows drop below a threshold of 7,000 cubic feet per second for more than 60 total days between May 1 and September 30, <i>id.</i>, at 41; and that significant harm to tupelo trees occurs when flows drop below a threshold of 14,100 cubic feet per second for more than 90 consecutive days between March 20 and September 22, <i>id.</i>, at 33, 41, 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Accepting these statements as true, passing more water through to Florida during nondroughts would not do these species any good.  All would still suffer the same harms during the summers of drought years when flows remain fixed at 5,000 cubic feet per second because of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 operations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If we contrast the <i>de minimus</i> benefits that Florida might receive from small amounts of additional water during nondroughts with the massive harms that Georgia would suffer if this Court cut its water use in half during droughts, it is clear who should prevail in this case.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s expert estimated that a cap on Georgia would have an \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ncremental [f]iscal [c]ost\xe2\x80\x9d of $35.2 million per year.  Sunding 44.  This figure included only additional costs that would require \xe2\x80\x9cthe [Georgia] legislature .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to appropriate money.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 Trial Tr. 2791.  The real cost of such a cap, which includes nongovernmental costs like welfare losses, would range anywhere from $191 million, <i>id.,</i> at 2787; Stavins 31, to more than $2 billion per year, <i>id.</i>, at 2.  And the cap would trigger resulting losses in Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s gross regional product and employment, totaling around $322 million and 4,173 jobs annually.  <i>Id.</i>, at 40.  Regardless of the measure used, this harm dwarfs the value of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s entire fishing industry in Apalachicola Bay, which pro- duces annual revenues of $11.7 million.  <i>Id.</i>, at 16.  And it greatly outweighs the value of the additional oysters that a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s use might produce\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>no more than a few hundred thousand dollars.  <i>Id.,</i> at 52.  Imposing an enormously high cost on one State so that another State can achieve a hollow victory is \xe2\x80\x9cnot the high equity that moves the conscience of the court in giving judgment between states.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Washington</i>, 297 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 523.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In the final analysis, Florida has not shown that it will appreciably benefit from a cap on Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s water use.  Absent such a showing, the balance of harms cannot tip in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Accordingly, I would have overruled Florida\xe2\x80\x99s objections to the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s Report and denied Florida\xe2\x80\x99s request for relief.

Thus, any additional water that a cap on Georgia generates during droughts would only increase streamflow into the Apalachicola River if it caused the natural streamflow to exceed 5,000 cubic feet per second.
