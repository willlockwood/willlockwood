That Act provides that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \xe2\x80\x9cshall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the Under Secretary decides that disclosur[e] would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1)(C).  Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9csensitive security information,\xe2\x80\x9d 67 Fed. Reg. 8351, which included \xe2\x80\x9c[s]pecific details of aviation security measures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations,\xe2\x80\x9d 49 CFR \xc2\xa71520.7(j).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n            \n        \n            \n        In July 2003, the TSA briefed all federal air marshals\xe2\x80\x94including Robert J. MacLean\xe2\x80\x94about a potential plot to hijack passenger flights.  A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas until early August.  MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous and illegal.  He therefore contacted a reporter and told him about the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to cancel the missions.  After discovering that MacLean was the source of the disclosure, the TSA fired him for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  He argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity under\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b)(8)(A), which protects employees who disclose information that reveals \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of any law, rule, or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection under that statute because his disclosure was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72302(b)(8)(A)\xe2\x80\x94namely, by\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1).  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision, holding that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was not \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        (a) The Government argues that MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d in two ways: first, by the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations on sensitive security information, and second, by Section 114(r)(1) itself, which authorized the TSA to promulgate those regulations.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        \n            \n        (i) MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was not prohibited by the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) because regulations do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d under that statute.  Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Congress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here; it used the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice to say \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.  In addition, Section 2302(b)(8)(A) creates a second exception for disclosures \xe2\x80\x9crequired by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the second exception is limited to actions by the President himself suggests that the first exception does not include action taken by executive agencies.  Finally, interpreting the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.  That interpretation would allow an agency to insulate itself from Section 2302(b)(8)(A) simply by promulgating a regulation that \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d all whistleblowing.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        The Government proposes two alternative interpretations, but neither is persuasive.  First, the Government argues that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d includes all regulations that have the \xe2\x80\x9cforce and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government bases this argument on the decision in <i>Chrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 281\n, where this Court held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d unless there is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear showing of contrary legislative intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 295\xe2\x80\x93296.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw,\xe2\x80\x9d in close connection with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d provides the necessary \xe2\x80\x9cclear showing\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d does not include regulations in this case.  Second, the Government argues that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d includes at least those regulations that were \xe2\x80\x9cpromulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government, however, was unable to find a single example of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d being used in that way.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        \n            \n        (ii) Likewise, MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was not prohibited by Section 114(r)(1).  That statute does not prohibit anything; instead, it authorizes the TSA to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, by its terms, Section 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure here.  The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure by imposing a \xe2\x80\x9clegislative mandate\xe2\x80\x9d on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that effect.  But the statute affords substantial discretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.  Thus, it is the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations\xe2\x80\x94not the statute\xe2\x80\x94that prohibited MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure, and those regulations do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n            \n        (b)  The Government argues that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like MacLean would \xe2\x80\x9cgravely endanger public safety\xe2\x80\x9d by making the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s 60,000 employees.  Those concerns are legitimate, but they must be addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court.

An exception exists, however, for disclosures that are \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Here, a federal air marshal publicly disclosed that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) had de-cided to cut costs by removing air marshals from certain long-distance flights.

As relevant here, that Act provides that the TSA \xe2\x80\x9cshall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1)(C).</p><p>                    Around the same time, the TSA promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it called \xe2\x80\x9csensitive security information.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 67 Fed. Reg. 8351 (2002).  The regulations described 18 categories of sensitive security information, including \xe2\x80\x9c[s]pecific details of aviation security measures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 CFR \xc2\xa71520.7(j) (2002).  Sensitive security information is not classified, so the TSA can share it with individuals who do not have a security clearance, such as airport employees.  Compare Exec. Order 13526, \xc2\xa74.1, 3 CFR 298, 314\xe2\x80\x93315 (2009 Comp.), with 49 CFR \xc2\xa71520.11(c) (2013).</p><p>B</p><p>                    Robert J. MacLean became a federal air marshal for the TSA in 2001.  In that role, MacLean was assigned to protect passenger flights from potential hijackings.  See49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa744917(a).</p><p>                    On July 26, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a confidential advisory about a potential hijacking plot.  The advisory said that members of the terrorist group al Qaeda were planning to attack passenger flights, and that they \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered suicide hijackings and bombings as the most promising methods to destroy aircraft in flight, as well as to strike ground targets.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 16.  The advisory identified a number of potential targets, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and the east coast of the United States.  Finally, the advisory warned that at least one of the attacks \xe2\x80\x9ccould be executed by the end of the summer 2003.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    The TSA soon summoned all air marshals (including MacLean) for face-to-face briefings about the hijacking plot.  During MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, a TSA official told him that the hijackers were planning to \xe2\x80\x9csmuggle weapons in camera equipment or children\xe2\x80\x99s toys through foreign security,\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cfly into the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into an airport that didn\xe2\x80\x99t require them to be screened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 92.  The hijackers would then board U.\xc2\xa0S. flights, \xe2\x80\x9coverpower the crew or the Air Marshals and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fly the planes into East Coast targets.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 93.</p><p>                    A few days after the briefing, MacLean received from the TSA a text message cancelling all overnight missions from Las Vegas until early August.  MacLean, who was stationed in Las Vegas, believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous.  He also believed that the cancellations were illegal, given that federal law required the TSA to put an air marshal on every flight that \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[s] high security risks,\xe2\x80\x9d49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa744917(a)(2), and provided that \xe2\x80\x9cnonstop, long distance flights, such as those targeted on September 11, 2001, should be a priority,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa744917(b).  See App. 95, 99, 101.</p><p>                    MacLean therefore asked a supervisor why the TSA had canceled the missions.  The supervisor responded that the TSA wanted \xe2\x80\x9cto save money on hotel costs because there was no more money in the budget.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 95.  MacLean also called the DHS Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s Office to report the cancellations.  But a special agent in that office told him there was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing that could be done.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 97.</p><p>                    Unwilling to accept those responses, MacLean contacted an MSNBC reporter and told him about the canceled missions.  In turn, the reporter published a story about the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s decision, titled \xe2\x80\x9cAir Marshals pulled from key flights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 36.  The story reported that air marshals would \xe2\x80\x9cno longer be covering cross-country or international flights\xe2\x80\x9d because the agency did not want them \xe2\x80\x9cto incur the expense of staying overnight in hotels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The story also reported that the cancellations were \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly disturbing to some\xe2\x80\x9d because they \xe2\x80\x9ccoincide[d] with anew high-level hijacking threat issued by the Department of Homeland Security.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 37.</p><p>                    After MSNBC published the story, several Members of Congress criticized the cancellations.  Within 24 hours, the TSA reversed its decision and put air marshals back on the flights.  <i>Id.,</i> at 50.</p><p>                    At first, the TSA did not know that MacLean was the source of the disclosure.  In September 2004, however, MacLean appeared on NBC Nightly News to criticize the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s dress code for air marshals, which he believed made them too easy to identify.  Although MacLean appeared in disguise, several co-workers recognized his voice, and the TSA began investigating the appearance.  During that investigation, MacLean admitted that he had disclosed the text message back in 2003.  Consequently, in April 2006, the TSA fired MacLean for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.</p><p>                    MacLean challenged his firing before the Merit Systems Protection Board, arguing in relevant part that his disclosure was protected whistleblowing activity under5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b)(8)(A).  The Board held that MacLean did not qualify for protection under that statute, however, because his disclosure was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  116 MSPR 562, 569\xe2\x80\x93572 (2011).</p><p>                    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  714 F.\xc2\xa03d 1301 (2013).  The parties had agreed that, in order for MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure to be \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited <i>by law</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d it must have been \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited by a statute rather than by a regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1308 (emphasis added).  Thus, the issue before the court was whether the statute authorizing the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations\xe2\x80\x94now codified at49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure.  714 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1308.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]*</p><p>                    The court first held that Section 114(r)(1) was not a prohibition.  The statute did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expressly prohibit employee disclosures,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, but instead empowered the TSA to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d if the TSA decided that disclosing the information would harm public safety.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1309.  The court therefore concluded that MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was prohibited by a regulation, which the parties had agreed could not be a \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>                    The court then held that, even if Section 114(r)(1) were a prohibition, it was not \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently specific.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The court explained that a law is sufficiently specific only if it \xe2\x80\x9crequires that matters be withheld from the public as to leave no discretion on the issue, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93969 (1978)).  And Section 114(r)(1) did not meet that test because it \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[d] only general criteria for withholding information and [gave] some discretion to the [TSA] to fashion regulations for prohibiting disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  714 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1309.  The court accordingly vacated the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision and remanded for a determination of whether MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure met the other requirements under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  <i>Id.,</i> at 1310\xe2\x80\x931311.</p><p>                    We granted certiorari.  572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).</p><p>II</p><p>                    Section 2302(b)(8) provides, in relevant part, that a federal agency may not take</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9ca personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cif such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>                    The Government argues that this whistleblower statute does not protect MacLean because his disclosure regarding the canceled missions was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d in two ways.  First, the Government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations on sensitive security information: 49 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71520.5(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 1520.7(j) (2003).  Second, the Government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1), which authorized the TSA to pro-mulgate those regulations.  We address each argument in turn.</p><p>A</p><p>1</p><p>                    In 2003, the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations prohibited the disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9c[s]pecific details of aviation security measures .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 CFR \xc2\xa71520.7(j).  MacLean does not dispute before this Court that the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the canceled missions.  Thus, the question here is whether a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is also \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited <i>by law</i>\xe2\x80\x9d under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  (Emphasis added.)</p><p>                    The answer is no.  Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, Section 2302(b)(1)(E) prohibits a federal agency from discriminating against an employee \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  For another example, Section 2302(b)(6) prohibits an agency from \xe2\x80\x9cgrant[ing] any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  And for a third example, Section 2302(b)(9)(A) prohibits an agency from retaliating against an employee for \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>                    In contrast, Congress did not use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory language at issue here; it used the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone.  That is significant because Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.  <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16,23 (1983).  Thus, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice to say \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.</p><p>                    The interpretive canon that Congress acts intentionally when it omits language included elsewhere applies with particular force here for two reasons.  First, Congress used \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in close proximity\xe2\x80\x94indeed, in the same sentence.  \xc2\xa72302(b)(8)(A) (protecting the disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9cany violation of any law, rule, or regulation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, Congress used the broader phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d repeatedly\xe2\x80\x94nine times in Section 2302 alone.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72302(a)(2)(D)(i), (b)(1)(E), (b)(6), (b)(8)(A)(i), (b)(8)(B)(i), (b)(9)(A), (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(5).  Those two aspects of the whistleblower statute make Con-gress\xe2\x80\x99s choice to use the narrower word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d seem quite deliberate.</p><p>                    We drew the same inference in <i>Department of Treasury, IRS</i> v. <i>FLRA</i>,494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 922 (1990).  There, the Government argued that the word \xe2\x80\x9claws\xe2\x80\x9d in one section of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 meant the same thing as the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in another section of the Act.  <i>Id.</i>, at 931.  We rejected that argument as \xe2\x80\x9csim-ply contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 932.  Indeed, we held that a statute that referred to \xe2\x80\x9claws\xe2\x80\x9d in one section and \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in another \xe2\x80\x9ccannot, unless we abandon all pretense at precise communication, be deemed to mean the same thing in both places.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That inference is even more compelling here, because the statute refers to \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in the same sentence, rather than several sections apart.</p><p>                    Another part of the statutory text points the same way.  After creating an exception for disclosures \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law,\xe2\x80\x9d Section 2302(b)(8)(A) goes on to create a second exception for information \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  This exception is limited to action taken directly by the President.  That suggests that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d in the only other exception is limited to actions by Congress\xe2\x80\x94after all, it would be unusual for the first exception to include action taken by executive agencies, when the second exception requires action by the President himself.</p><p>                    In addition, a broad interpretation of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.  If \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d included agency rules and regulations, then an agency could insulate itself from the scope of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) merely by promulgating a regulation that \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d whistleblowing.  But Congress passed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did not trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their ranks.  Thus, it is unlikely that Congress meant to include rules and regulations within the word \xe2\x80\x9claw.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>2</p><p>                    The Government admits that some regulations fall outside the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d as used in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).  But, the Government says, that does not mean that <i>all</i> regulations are excluded.  The Government suggests two interpretations that would distinguish \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d but would still allow the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9dto subsume the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations on sensitive security information.</p><p>                    First, the Government argues that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d includes all regulations that have the \xe2\x80\x9cforce and effect of law\xe2\x80\x9d (<i>i.e.</i>, legislative regulations), while excluding those that do not (<i>e.g.</i>, interpretive rules).  Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9322.  The Government bases this argument on our decision in <i>Chrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 281 (1979).  There, we held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it would take a \xe2\x80\x9cclear showing of contrary legislative intent\xe2\x80\x9d before we concluded otherwise.  <i>Id.</i>, at 295\xe2\x80\x93296.  Thus, because the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations have the force and effect of law, the Government says that they should qualify as \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute.</p><p>                    The Government\xe2\x80\x99s description of <i>Chrysler</i> is accurate enough.  But Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw,\xe2\x80\x9d in close connection with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d provides the necessary \xe2\x80\x9cclear showing\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d does not include regulations.  Indeed, using \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9claw, rule, or regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in the same sentence would be a very obscure way of drawing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s nuanced distinction between different types of regulations.  Had Congress wanted to draw that distinction, there were far easier and clearer ways to do so.  For example, at the time Congress passed Section 2302(b)(8)(A), another federal statute defined the words \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory order\xe2\x80\x9d to include a \xe2\x80\x9crule or regulation, if it has the force and effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7450c(a) (1976 ed.).  Likewise, another federal statute defined the words \xe2\x80\x9cState law\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9call laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law.\xe2\x80\x9d29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71144(c)(1) (1976 ed.).  As those examples show, Congress knew how to distinguish between regulations that had the force and effect of law and those that did not, but chose not to do so in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p><p>                    Second, the Government argues that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d includes at least those regulations that were \xe2\x80\x9cpromulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21.  Outside of this case, however, the Government was unable to find a single example of the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d being used in that way.  Not a single dictionary definition, not a single statute, not a single case.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation happens to fit this case precisely, but it needs more than that to recommend it.</p><p>                    Although the Government argues here that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d includes rules and regulations, it definitively re-jected that argument in the Court of Appeals.  For example, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief accepted that the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9dmeant \xe2\x80\x9clegislative enactment,\xe2\x80\x9d and said that the \xe2\x80\x9conly dispute\xe2\x80\x9d was whether49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cserve[d] as that legislative enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent in No. 11\xe2\x80\x933231 (CA Fed.), pp. 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  Then, at oral argument, a judge asked the Government\xe2\x80\x99s attorney the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I understood your brief to concede that [the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d] can\xe2\x80\x99t be a rule or regulation, it means statute.  Am I wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attorney responded: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong your honor.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as clear as I can.  \xe2\x80\x98Specifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x99 here means statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oral Arg. Audio in No. 11\xe2\x80\x933231, at 22:42\xe2\x80\x9323:03; see also <i>id.</i>, at 29:57\xe2\x80\x9330:03 (\xe2\x80\x9cNow, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing here, we\xe2\x80\x99re not saying here that [the word \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d] needs to encompass regulations.  We\xe2\x80\x99re saying statute.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Those concessions reinforce our conclusion that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed interpretations are unpersuasive.</p><p>                    In sum, when Congress used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d it meant to exclude rules and regulations.  We therefore hold that the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p><p>B</p><p>                    We next consider whether MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure regarding the canceled missions was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1) itself.  As relevant here, that statute provides that the TSA \xe2\x80\x9cshall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7114(r)(1)(C).</p><p>                    This statute does not prohibit anything.  On the con-trary, it <i>authorizes</i> something\xe2\x80\x94it authorizes the Under Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, by its terms Section 114(r)(1) did not prohibit the disclosure at issue here.</p><p>                    The Government responds that Section 114(r)(1) did prohibit MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure by imposing a \xe2\x80\x9clegislative mandate\xe2\x80\x9d on the TSA to promulgate regulations to that effect.  See Brief for Petitioner 28, 33; see also <i>post</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  But the Government pushes the statute too far.  Section 114(r)(1) says that the TSA shall prohibit disclosures only \xe2\x80\x9c<i>if the Under Secretary decides</i> that disclosing the information would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7114(r)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  That language affords substantial discretion to the TSA in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.</p><p>                    The dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discretion, viewing it as the almost ministerial task of \xe2\x80\x9c<i>identifying</i> whether a particular piece of information falls within the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 3.  But determining which documents meet the statutory standard of \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the security of transportation\xe2\x80\x9d requires the exercise of considerable judgment.  For example, the Government says that Section 114(r)(1) requires the Under Secretary to prohibit disclosures like MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s.  The Government also says, however, that the statute does not require the Under Secretary to prohibit an employee from disclosing that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal air marshals will be absent from important flights, but declining to specify which flights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 23.  That fine-grained distinction comes not from Section 114(r)(1) itself, but from the Under Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion.  It is the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations\xe2\x80\x94not the statute\xe2\x80\x94that prohibited MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure.  And as the dissent agrees, a regulation does not count as \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d under the whistleblower statute.  See <i>post</i>, at 1.</p><p>                    The Government insists, however, that this grant of discretion does not make Section 114(r)(1) any less of a prohibition.  In support, the Government relies on <i>Administrator, FAA</i> v. <i>Robertson</i>,422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 255 (1975).  That case involved the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which requires federal agencies to disclose information upon request unless, among other things, the information is \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\xe2\x80\x9d5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(3).  In <i>Robertson</i>, we held that the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was one such statute, because it gave the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \xe2\x80\x9ca broad degree of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding whether to disclose or withhold information.  422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 266.</p><p>                    The Government tries to analogize that case to this one.  In <i>Robertson</i>, the Government says, the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion whether to disclose information did not preclude a finding that the information was \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically exempted\xe2\x80\x9d from disclosure by statute.  So too here, the Government says, the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion whether to prohibit disclosure of information does not preclude a finding that the information is \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited\xe2\x80\x9d from disclosure by Section 114(r)(1).  See Brief for Petitioner 30.</p><p>                    This analogy fails.  FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) differ in an important way: The provision of FOIA at issue involves information that is \xe2\x80\x9c<i>exempted</i>\xe2\x80\x9d from disclosure, while Section 2302(b)(8)(A) involves information that is \xe2\x80\x9c<i>prohibited</i>\xe2\x80\x9d from disclosure.</p><p>                    A statute that exempts information from mandatory disclosure may nonetheless give the agency discretion to release that exempt information to the public.  In such a case, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion has no effect on whether the information is \xe2\x80\x9cexempted from disclosure <i>by statute</i>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it remains exempt whatever the agency chooses to do.</p><p>                    The situation is different when it comes to a statute giving an agency discretion to prohibit the disclosure of information.  The information is not prohibited from disclosure <i>by statute</i> regardless of what the agency does.  Itis the agency\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion that determines whether there is a prohibition at all.  Thus, when Section 114(r)(1) gave the TSA the discretion to prohibit the disclosure of information, the statute did not create a prohibition\xe2\x80\x94it gave the TSA the power to create one.  And because Section 114(r)(1) did not create a prohibition, MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure was not \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited <i>by law</i>\xe2\x80\x9d under Section 2302(b)(8)(A), but only by a regulation issued in the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p><p>                    In any event, <i>Robertson</i> was a case about FOIA, not Section 2302, and our analysis there depended on two FOIA-specific factors that are not present here.  First, we examined the legislative history of FOIA and determined that Congress did not intend that statute to affect laws like the Federal Aviation Act.  422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 263\xe2\x80\x93265.  In particular, we noted that the Civil Aeronautics Board had expressed its view during congressional hearings that the Federal Aviation Act qualified as an exempting statute under FOIA, and that \xe2\x80\x9cno question was raised or challenge made\xe2\x80\x9d to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view.  <i>Id.,</i> at 264\xe2\x80\x93265.  But that legislative history can have no effect on our analysis of Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p><p>                    Second, we said that the Federal Aviation Act could fail to qualify as an exempting statute only if we read FOIA \xe2\x80\x9cas repealing by implication all existing statutes which restrict public access to specific Government records.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 265 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, relying on the presumption that \xe2\x80\x9crepeals by implication are disfavored,\xe2\x80\x9d we rejected that interpretation of FOIA.  But the presumption against implied repeals has no relevance here.  Saying that Section 114(r)(1) is not a prohibition under the whistleblower statute is not the same as saying that the whistleblower statute implicitly repealed Section 114(r)(1).  On the contrary, Section 114(r)(1) remains in force by allowing the TSA to deny FOIA requests and prohibit employee disclosures that do not qualify for whistleblower protection under Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p><p>                    Ultimately, FOIA and Section 2302(b)(8)(A) are different statutes\xe2\x80\x94they have different language, different histories, and were enacted in different contexts.  Our interpretation of one, therefore, has no impact whatsoever on our interpretation of the other.</p><p>III</p><p>                    Finally, the Government warns that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like MacLean would \xe2\x80\x9cgravely endanger public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 38.  That protection, the Government argues, would make the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s 60,000 employees.  <i>Id.</i>, at 37.  And those employees will \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely lack access to all of the information that led the TSA to make particular security decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 38.  Thus, the Government says, we should conclude that Congress did not intend for Section 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover disclosures like MacLean\xe2\x80\x99s.</p><p>                    Those concerns are legitimate.  But they are concerns that must be addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court.  Congress could, for example, amend Section 114(r)(1) so that the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions on disclosure override the whistleblower protections in Section 2302(b)(8)(A)\xe2\x80\x94just as those prohibitions currently override FOIA.  See \xc2\xa7114(r)(1) (authorizing the TSA to prohibit disclosures \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding section 552 of title 5\xe2\x80\x9d); see also10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72640(h) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary of Defense may (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold from public disclosure safety-related information that is provided to the Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for the purposes of this section\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress could also exempt the TSA from the requirements of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) entirely, as Congress has already done for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office.  See5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I).</p><p>                    Likewise, the President could prohibit the disclosure of sensitive security information by Executive order.  Indeed, the Government suggested at oral argument that the President could \xe2\x80\x9centirely duplicate\xe2\x80\x9d the regulations that the TSA has issued under Section 114(r)(1).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\xe2\x80\x9320.  Such an action would undoubtedly create an exception to the whistleblower protections found in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p><p>                    Although Congress and the President each has the power to address the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, neither has done so.  It is not our role to do so for them.</p><p>                    The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is</p><p>Affirmed.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"><span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span><span class="opinion-footnote-text">*\xc2\xa0This statute has a complicated history.

I have no qualms with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically prohibited by law,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA),5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72302(b)(8)(A), does not encompass disclosures prohibited only by regulation.  See <i>ante</i>, at 7.  Nor do I see any problem in the distinction the Court draws between statutes that <i>prohibit</i> information from being disclosed, the violation of which may preclude application of the WPA, and statutes that simply <i>exempt</i> information from otherwise-applicable disclosure requirements, which do not trigger the WPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  See <i>ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</p><p>                    I part ways with the Court, however, when it concludes that49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7114(r)(1) does not itself prohibit the type of disclosure at issue here\xe2\x80\x94the release of information regarding the absence of federal air marshals on overnight flights.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  That statute provides, in relevant part, that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \xe2\x80\x9c<i>shall</i> prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7114(r)(1) (emphasis added).</p><p>                    The Court reasons, first, that Section 114(r)(1) does not \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit anything,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead simply \xe2\x80\x9c<i>authorizes</i>\xe2\x80\x9d the TSA to prescribe regulations.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  But this contention overlooks the statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall,\xe2\x80\x9d which, as we have observed, \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally means \xe2\x80\x98must.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gutierrez de Martinez </i>v. <i>Lamagno</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417,432, n.9 (1995); see also, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Federal.

Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 114 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the word <i>shall</i> can reasonably read as mandatory, it ought to be so read\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 114(r)(1) does not merely <i>authorize</i> the TSA to promulgate regulations; it directs it to do so, and describes what those regulations must accomplish.</p><p>                    The Court focuses, second, on the fact that Section 114(r) authorizes the TSA to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decid[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whether the disclosure of a particular item of information would in fact be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98detrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (emphasis deleted).  I certainly agree that this language vests some discretion in the agency.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  But the agency is required to prevent the disclosure of any information it determines is within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prohibition; its discretion pertains only to <i>identifying</i> whether a particular piece of information falls within the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 command.  In concluding that such residual agency discretion deprives Section 114(r) of prohibitory effect, the Court overlooks the degree of agency involvement that is necessary in the administration of many antidisclosure statutes.  Congress cannot be expected to identify with particularity each individual document or datum the release of which it wants to preclude.  Often, it will have to leave to an agency or other enforcing authority the tasks of defining\xe2\x80\x94perhaps through regulations\xe2\x80\x94exactly what type of information falls within the scope of the congressional prohibition, and of determining whether a particular item of information fits the bill.  The enforcing authority may, as the Court puts it, sometimes be required to make some \xe2\x80\x9cfine-grained distinction[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in fulfilling this charge, <i>ante</i>, at 12, but that does not change the fact that Congress itself is the source of the prohibition on disclosure.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>                    Indeed, Congress appears to have anticipated the need for agency involvement in the interpretation and enforcement of antidisclosure statutes at the time it enacted the WPA.  The Senate Report to the WPA identified only two statutes the violation of which would preclude whistleblower protection, the first being Section 102(d)(3) of the National Security Act of 1947,61Stat.498, which pro-vided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Director of Central Intelligence shall be re-sponsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d  See S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93969, pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (1978).  This example clearly suggests Congress contemplated that a statute directing an agency to protect against disclosures and delegating substantial authority to the agency should nevertheless be deemed to impose the relevant prohibition.  Section 114(r)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s delegation to the TSA to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide\xe2\x80\x9d whether the release of particular information would be \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the security of transportation\xe2\x80\x9d likewise simply reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition of the inevitable fact that the agency will be tasked, in the first instance, with enforcing its statutory mandate.</p><p>                    In sum, with Section 114(r)(1), Congress has required agency action that would preclude the release of information \xe2\x80\x9cdetrimental to the security of transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In so doing, Congress has expressed its clear intent to pro-hibit such disclosures.  I would respect its intent, and hold that a disclosure contravening that mandate is \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the WPA.</p><p>                    Having said all that, I appreciate the narrowness of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Section 114(r) does not itself prohibit any disclosures depends entirely on the statutory language directing the agency to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d and providing that the agency will \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[e]\xe2\x80\x9d what information falls within the statue\xe2\x80\x99s purview.  See <i>ante</i>, at 11.  From all that appears in the majority opinion, then, this case would likely have turned out differently if Section 114(r) instead provided: \xe2\x80\x9cThe disclosure of information detrimental to the security of transportation is prohibited, and the TSA shall promulgate regulations to that effect,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Under Secretary shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information detrimental to the security of transportation; and such disclosures are prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  I myself decline to surrender so fully to sheer formalism, especially where transportation security is at issue and there is little dispute that the disclosure of air marshals\xe2\x80\x99 locations is potentially dangerous and was proscribed by the relevant implementing regulation.  In so surrendering, however, the Court would appear to have enabled future courts and Con-gresses to avoid easily the consequences of its ruling, and thus to have limited much of the potential for adverse practical effects beyond this case.  But in the interim, at least, the Court has left important decisions regarding the disclosure of critical information completely to the whims of individual employees.</p><p>                    I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"><span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span><span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court does not address respondent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument, accepted by the Court of Appeals below, that Section 114(r)(1) describes the information encompassed in its prohibitory scope with insufficient particularity to qualify the disclosure here as \xe2\x80\x9c<i>specifically</i> prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the WPA.  Some of the legislative history of the WPA linked its specificity requirement to the criteria established in Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act,5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552(b)(3), and the Court of Appeals applied this standard.  See 714 F. 3d 1301, 1309 (CA Fed. 2013); see also S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93969, pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (1978).  MacLean has offered no argument that a WPA anti-disclosure statute must define the relevant category of information with any greater degree of particularity.  Assuming the Exemption 3 standard is applicable, I note that Section 114(r) is at least as \xe2\x80\x9cspecific\xe2\x80\x9d as the statutory provisions we have previously held to satisfy Exemption 3\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Department of Justice</i> v. <i>Julian</i>,486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,9 (1988) (holding that provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(3)(A) and former18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74208(c)(1982 ed.) prohibiting disclosure of portions of presentence reports \xe2\x80\x9crelat[ed] to confidential sources, diagnostic opinions, <i>and other information that may cause harm to the defendant or to third parties</i>\xe2\x80\x9d could justify withholding under Exemption 3 (emphasis added)).</span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"><span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2">2</a></span><span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0For the same reasons, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision that a disclosure contravened a statute may not necessarily be determinative in any given WPA case: Although an agency may no doubt receive deference in the interpretation and implementation of a prohibitory statute, ultimately WPA protection will not apply if the agency improperly concluded that a given disclosure was prohibited by that statute.
