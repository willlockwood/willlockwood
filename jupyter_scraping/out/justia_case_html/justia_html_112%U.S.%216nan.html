The claimant demurred to the information as not setting forth any facts warranting the seizure or forfeiture of the property.  The demurrer was overruled, the claimant filed an answer, and upon a trial a verdict was returned in this form "We, the jury, find a verdict for the government, evaluating the goods and machinery seized at a sum of one thousand dollars."  The claimant moved, in arrest of judgment, that several of the counts were insufficient, and that the verdict was general upon all the counts, and was vague and uncertain, and not responsive to the issue.

He stated the facts in the foregoing language, and continued:</p>\n<p>Informations under the revenue laws for the forfeiture of goods, seeking no judgment of fine or imprisonment against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 112 U. S. 217</a></p><p> any person, are not strictly criminal cases, in which the decisions of the circuit court are final unless a division of opinion is certified, but they are civil actions, of which this Court has jurisdiction in error without regard to the sum or value in dispute.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 699; <em>Pettigrew v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/385/case.html">97 U. S. 385</a></span>.  Yet, as has been expressly adjudged, they are so far in the nature of criminal proceedings as to come within the rule that a general verdict upon several counts, seeking in different forms one object, must be upheld if one count is good.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/242/case.html">Clifton v. United States,</a></span></em> 4 How. 242,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/242/case.html#250">45 U. S. 250</a></span>.  As one of the counts in this case is admitted to be good, it is unnecessary to consider the objections taken to the other counts.</p>\n<p>The verdict, though expressed in bad English, clearly manifested the intention and finding of the jury upon the issue submitted to them, and the court rightly gave judgment upon it.
