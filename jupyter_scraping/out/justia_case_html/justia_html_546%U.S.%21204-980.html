Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.2.  At the penalty phase, the jury was instructed to consider a list of sentencing factors, including \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he circumstances of the crime \xe2\x80\xa6 and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.3(a), and sentenced him to death.  The State Supreme Court invalidated two of the special circumstances on direct appeal, but nonetheless affirmed the conviction and sentence.  The Federal District Court subsequently denied Sanders habeas relief, rejecting his claim that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of invalid special circumstances rendered his death sentence unconstitutional.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit applied the rules for \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d States, see<em> Stringer</em> v. <em>Black,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/index.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cnon-weighing\xe2\x80\x9d States, see <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U.

S. 238</a> <em>(per curiam), </em>is usually met when the trier of fact finds at least one statutory eligibility factor at either the guilt or penalty phase.  Once this narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer must determine whether an eligible defendant should receive the death penalty; many States channel this function by specifying aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  In answering the question confronted here\xe2\x80\x94what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after finding a valid eligibility factor, but under a scheme in which another eligibility factor is later held invalid\xe2\x80\x94this Court has set forth different rules for so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  In a weighing State, the sentencer could consider as aggravation only specified eligibility factors.  Where the sentencer relied on an eligibility factor that was later invalidated, the sentencer was erroneously invited to count the invalid factor as weighing in favor of death, thus \xe2\x80\x9cskewing\xe2\x80\x9d the weighing process, <em>Stringer</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 232.  Such automatic skewing would not necessarily occur in a non-weighing State, however, which permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factors.  This weighing/non-weighing scheme seems needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of variations.  This Court is henceforth guided by the following rule: An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process unless one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02. The jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of invalid special circumstances in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case gave rise to no constitutional violation.  In California, the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d listed in \xc2\xa7190.2 are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy <em>Furman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrowing requirement<em>.  </em>If the jury finds the existence of one of those circumstances, it must \xe2\x80\x9ctake into account\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>separate</em> list of sentencing factors, including \xc2\xa7190.3(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d factor.  That factor has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus making California (in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Setting aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and applying the more direct analysis set out here, two of the four special circumstances were invalidated, but the remaining two are sufficient to satisfy <em>Furman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrowing requirement and alone rendered Sanders death eligible.  Moreover, all of the facts and circumstances admissible to prove the invalid eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts and circumstances under the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing factor.  Even if \xc2\xa7190.3(a)\xe2\x80\x99s direction to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of any special circumstances found to be true\xe2\x80\x9d placed special emphasis upon the facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid factors, that impact \xe2\x80\x9ccannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zant, supra,</em> at 889.

See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.2 (West Supp. 1995).  The trial then moved to a penalty phase, at which the jury was instructed to consider a list of sentencing factors relating to Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 background and the nature of the crime, one of which was \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7190.3(a) (West 1999).

S. 238</a> (1972) <em>(per curiam)</em>, we have required States to limit the class of murderers to which the death penalty may be applied.  This narrowing requirement is usually met when the trier of fact finds at least one statutorily defined eligibility factor at either the guilt or penalty phase.  See <em>Tuilaepa</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/967/index.html">512 U. S. 967</a>, 971\xe2\x80\x93972 (1994).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in <em>all </em>capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mitigating evidence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 110 (1982).  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as \xe2\x80\x9cweighing State[s]\xe2\x80\x9d those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Dugger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/308/index.html">498 U. S. 308</a>, 313, 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (1991) (citing Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(3)(b) (1985)); <em>Richmond</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/40/index.html">506 U. S. 40</a>, 47 (1992) (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacity\xe2\x80\x94for example, as relevant to an omnibus \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, <em>Stringer</em>, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, in a non-weighing State\xe2\x80\x94a State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factors\xe2\x80\x94this automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors <em>added</em> to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it \xe2\x80\x9cauthorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected,\xe2\x80\x9d or that it \xe2\x80\x9cattache[s] the \xe2\x80\x98aggravating\xe2\x80\x99 label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, \xe2\x80\xa6 or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zant,</em> 462 U. S., at 885.  Second, the death sentence must be set aside if the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the invalidated eligibility factor allowed it to hear evidence that would not otherwise have been before it.  See <em>id.</em>, at 886; see also <em>Tuggle</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/10/index.html">516 U. S. 10</a>, 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (1995) <em>(per curiam)</em>.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and <em>not </em>an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie \xe2\x80\x9cskewed,\xe2\x80\x9d and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the <em>other </em>aggravating factors, usually an omnibus factor but conceivably another one, made it entirely proper for the jury to consider as aggravating the facts and circumstances underlying the invalidated factor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think it will clarify the analysis, and simplify the sentence-invalidating factors we have hitherto applied to non-weighing States, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936<em>, </em>if we are henceforth guided by the following rule: An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] <em>unless</em> one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This test is not, as Justice Breyer describes it, \xe2\x80\x9can inquiry based solely on the admissibility of the underlying evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 15 (dissenting opinion).  If the presence of the invalid sentencing factor allowed the sentencer to consider evidence that would not otherwise have been before it, due process would mandate reversal without regard to the rule we apply here.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6; see also n.\xc2\xa06, this page.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The issue we confront is the skewing that could result from the jury\xe2\x80\x99s considering <em>as aggravation</em> properly admitted evidence that should not have weighed in favor of the death penalty.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Stringer</em>, 503 U. S., at 232 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale.\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we have explained, such skewing will occur, and give rise to constitutional error, only where the jury could not have given aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances under the rubric of some other, valid sentencing factor.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy <em>Furman</em>.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Bacigalupo</em>, 6 Cal. 4th 457, 467\xe2\x80\x93468, 862 P.\xc2\xa02d 808, 813 (1993)<em>.</em>  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to \xe2\x80\x9ctake into account\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>separate</em> list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he circumstances of the crime\nof which the defendant was convicted in the present\nproceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the sentencer [is] restricted to a \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d of aggravation against mitigation\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Calderon</em>, 52 F. 3d 1465, 1478 (CA9 1995)).  The last statement is inaccurate.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d factor can hardly be called \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete.\xe2\x80\x9d  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 contention, and Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.  The erroneous factor could not have \xe2\x80\x9cskewed\xe2\x80\x9d the sentence, and no constitutional violation occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More specifically, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 jury found four special circumstances to be true: that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in \xe2\x80\xa6 Robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted while the defendant was engaged in \xe2\x80\xa6 Burglary in the first or second degree,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(17)(G); that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing \xe2\x80\xa6 her testimony in any criminal \xe2\x80\xa6 proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(10); and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see <em>People</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 1 Cal. 3d 431, 439\xe2\x80\x93440, 462 P.\xc2\xa02d 22, 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (1969) (in banc).  51 Cal. 3d, at 517, 797 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 587.  The court invalidated the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d special circumstance because it had previously found that to be unconstitutionally vague.  <em>Id.</em>, at 520, 797 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 589 (citing <em>People</em> v. <em>Superior Court</em>, 31 Cal. 3d 797, 647 P.\xc2\xa02d 76 (1982)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the California Supreme Court noted, however, \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury properly considered two special circumstances [eligibility factors] (robbery-murder and witness-killing).\xe2\x80\x9d  51 Cal. 3d, at 520, 797 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 589\xe2\x80\x93590.  These are sufficient to satisfy <em>Furman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing factor.  They were properly considered whether or not they bore upon the invalidated eligibility factors.  See 51 Cal. 3d, at 521, 797 P. 2d, at 590.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sanders argues that the weighing process was skewed by the fact that the jury was asked to consider, as one of the sentencing factors, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3(a) (West 1999).  In Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 view, that placed special emphasis upon those facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid eligibility factor.  Virtually the same thing happened in <em>Zant.</em>  There the Georgia jury was permitted to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conside[r] all evidence in extenuation, mitigation and aggravation of punishment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 462 U. S., at 871\xe2\x80\x93872 (quoting <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens</em>, 250 Ga. 97, 99\xe2\x80\x93100, 297 S. E. 2d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (1982)), but also instructed specifically that it could consider \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances which you find are supported by the evidence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 462 U.

Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial history of serious assaultive convictions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 867) was later invalidated, we upheld the sentence.  We acknowledged that the erroneous instruction \xe2\x80\x9cmight have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 888; indeed, we <em>assumed </em>such an effect, <em>ibid.  </em>But the effect was \xe2\x80\x9cmerely a consequence of the statutory label \xe2\x80\x9caggravating circumstanc[e].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  We agreed with the Georgia Supreme Court that any such impact was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inconsequential,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 889, and held that it \xe2\x80\x9ccannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  The same is true here.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the invalid \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d gave rise to no constitutional violation, the Court of Appeals erred in ordering habeas relief.

See <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9312 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Stringer</em> v. <em>Black,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/index.html"></a><a href="/us/503/222/index.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, 232 (1992) (weighing/non-weighing distinction is \xe2\x80\x9cof critical importance\xe2\x80\x9d).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sanders</em> v. <em>Woodford</em>, 373 F.\xc2\xa03d 1054, 1059\xe2\x80\x931060 (CA9 2004); <em>Flamer</em> v. <em>Delaware</em>, 68 F.\xc2\xa03d 736, 746\xe2\x80\x93749 (CA3 1995); <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, <em>post</em>, at 8, <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/862/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/862/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/862/index.html">462 U.

But the core holding is what we said next:  \xe2\x80\x9cMore importantly, \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>any possible impact </em>cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added); see also <em>post</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  <em>Zant</em> must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim of constitutional error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Clemons</em> v. <em>Mississippi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/738/index.html">494 U.

Justice Breyer points out that <em>Clemons</em>\xe2\x80\x99 harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of <em>how</em> harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from <em>Clemons</em> that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753\xe2\x80\x93754) says nothing about <em>when</em> that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, <em>Clemons</em> maintains the distinction envisioned in <em>Zant</em>, see 462 U. S., at 890\xe2\x80\x93891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see <em>Clemons</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 745.  Likewise, <em>Stringer</em> specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d 503 U.

Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see \xc2\xa799\xe2\x80\x9319\xe2\x80\x93101(3)(b) (1993 Cum.

In the former, the sole function of an aggravating circumstance finding is to make the defendant eligible for the death penalty.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U. S. 862</a>, 874 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n Georgia, the finding of an aggravating circumstance does not play any role in guiding the sentencing body in the exercise of its discretion [to impose the death penalty], apart from its function of narrowing the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the latter, such a finding performs a second function\xe2\x80\x94it provides a reason for deciding to impose that sentence on an eligible defendant.  See, <em>e.g., Clemons </em>v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/738/index.html">494 U. S. 738</a>, 745 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Mississippi, unlike the Georgia scheme considered in <em>Zant</em>, the finding of aggravating factors is part of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing determination, and the jury is required to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, in a nonweighing State, the finding of four aggravating circumstances has the same legal significance as a finding of three, and invalidation of one is presumptively harmless.  See <em>Stringer</em> v. <em>Black</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/index.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, 232 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, when a jury is told to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in making its penalty decision, four aggravators presumptively are more weighty than three.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale\xe2\x80\x9d).  For example, when a jury, as here, is incorrectly informed that its finding that a killing was \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d provides a reason for imposing death, see generally Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), that error may well affect the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations.  Having been told to weigh \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he circumstances of the crime \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>and</em> the existence of any [aggravating] circumstances found to be true,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7190.3(a) (West 1999) (emphasis added), the jury may consider its conclusion that the killing was heinous separately from the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d underlying that erroneous conclusion, improperly counting the nature of the crime twice in determining whether a sentence of death is warranted.  Or the jury, recognizing that the legislature has decided that a \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d murder, without more, can be worthy of the death penalty, may consider this a legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding than the circumstances of the crime would otherwise dictate.<font b="1">  Under either scenario a weight has been added to death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale, and one cannot presume that this weight made no difference to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion. </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are, of course, different weighing systems.  If a jury is told that only those specific aggravating circumstances making the defendant eligible for the death penalty may provide reasons for imposing that penalty, its consideration of an invalid factor is obviously more prejudicial than if the jury is told that it may also consider all of the circumstances of the crime.  The fact that California sentencing juries may consider these circumstances increases the likelihood that their consideration of a subsequently invalidated aggravating circumstance will be harmless, but it does not take California out of the \xe2\x80\x9cweighing State\xe2\x80\x9d category.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, has decided to convert the weighing/nonweighing distinction from one focused on the </p>\n<p>\n\nrole aggravating circumstances play in a jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing deliberations to one focused on the evidence the jury may consider during those deliberations. Compare <em>Stringer</em>, 503 U. S., at 229 (explaining that Mississippi is a weighing State because the jury must weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in choosing whether to impose the death penalty, while Georgia is a nonweighing State because \xe2\x80\x9caggravating factors as such have no specific function in [that] decision\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process <em>unless</em> one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  But whether an aggravating circumstance finding plays a role in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose the death penalty has nothing to do with whether the jury may separately consider \xe2\x80\x9call the \xe2\x80\x98circumstances of the crime.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, if the question had been presented to us, I might well have concluded that the error here was harmless.  See generally <em>Brecht </em>v. <em>Abrahamson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/index.html">507 U. S. 619</a>, 638 (1993).  But the State has merely asked us to decide whether California is a weighing State, see Pet. for Cert. i, and the Court of Appeals correctly decided that the statutory text has unambiguously answered that question.  Cf. \xc2\xa7190.3 (enumerating aggravating and mitigating circumstances and requiring \xe2\x80\x9cthe trier of fact [to] impose a sentence of death if [it] concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of heeding this plain language, the Court has chosen to modify our settled law, ignoring the dual role played by aggravating circumstances in California\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty regime.  Because this decision is more likely to complicate than to clarify our capital sentencing jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962018">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBROWN V.

In my view, it does not matter whether California is a \xe2\x80\x9cweighing\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cnonweighing\xe2\x80\x9d State, as ordinary rules of appellate review should apply.  A reviewing court must find that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an invalid aggravator was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the form a State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty law takes.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand my answer, one must fully understand the question, including the somewhat misleading terminology in which the question is phrased.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Death penalty proceedings take place in two stages.  At the first stage, the jury must determine whether there is something especially wrongful, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9caggravating,\xe2\x80\x9d about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  State statutes typically list these specific \xe2\x80\x9caggravating\xe2\x80\x9d factors, and the jury typically must find at least one such factor present for the defendant to become eligible for the death penalty.  \xe2\x80\x9cBy doing so, the jury narrows the class of persons eligible for the death penalty according to an objective legislative definition,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by the Eighth Amendment.  <em>Lowenfield</em> v. <em>Phelps,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/231/index.html">484 U. S. 231</a>, 244 (1988).  If the jury finds that an aggravating factor is present and the defendant is consequently eligible for the death penalty, it proceeds to Stage Two.  At Stage Two, the jury (or sometimes the judge) must determine whether to sentence the defendant to death or to provide a different sentence (usually, life imprisonment).  At this stage, this Court has said, States divide as to their approach.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Weighing States</em>.  Some States tell the jury: \xe2\x80\x9cConsider all the mitigating factors and weigh them against the <em>specific aggravating factors </em>that you found, at Stage One, made the defendant eligible for the death penalty.  If the aggravating factors predominate, you must sentence the defendant to death; otherwise, you may not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the law in these States tells the jury to weigh <em>only</em> statutory aggravating factors (typically the same factors considered at Stage One)<em> </em>against the mitigating factors, this Court has called these States \xe2\x80\x9cweighing States.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is something of a misnomer because the jury cannot weigh everything but is instead limited to weighing certain statutorily defined aggravating factors.  The Court has identified Mississippi as a classic example of a weighing State.  See <em>Stringer</em> v. <em>Black,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/index.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, 229 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Nonweighing States. </em> Other States tell the jury: \xe2\x80\x9cConsider all the mitigating factors and weigh them, not simply against the statutory<em> </em>aggravating factors you previously found at Stage One, but against <em>any and all</em> factors you consider aggravating.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the balance includes <em>all </em>aggravating factors and not only those on the Stage One eligibility list, this Court has called such States \xe2\x80\x9cnonweighing States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although it might be clearer to call these States \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete weighing\xe2\x80\x9d States (for the jury can weigh <em>everything</em> that is properly admissible), I shall continue to use the traditional terminology.  The Court has identified Georgia as the prototypical example of a State that has adopted this complete weighing approach.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in this case arises under the following circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) At Stage One, a jury found several aggravating factors, the presence of any one of which would make the defendant eligible for the death penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2) At least one of those aggravating factors was an \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d factor, <em>i.e.</em>, a factor that the law forbids the jury from considering as aggravating and that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s use of which (for this purpose) was later invalidated on appeal.  The sentencing court made a mistake, indeed a mistake of constitutional dimensions, when it listed the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d, Cal.\xc2\xa0Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), aggravating factor as one of the several factors for the jury to consider at Stage One.  See<em> Godfrey</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/index.html">446 U. S. 420</a>, 433 (1980) (plurality opinion).  But that mistake did not, in and of itself, forbid application of the death penalty.  After all, the jury also found <em>other</em> listed aggravating factors, the presence of any one of which made the defendant <em>eligible </em>for the death penalty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3) All the evidence before the sentencing jury at Stage Two was properly<em> </em>admitted.  The evidence that supported the improper<em> </em>heinousness factor, for example, also showed how the crime was committed, and the jury is clearly entitled to consider it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this outline of the problem, two questions follow.  <em>Question One: </em>Is it possible that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s legal mistake at Stage One\xe2\x80\x94telling the jury that it could determine that the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravator was present\xe2\x80\x94prejudiced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking at Stage Two?  In other words, could that mistake create harmful error, causing the jury to impose a death sentence due to the fact that it was told to give special weight to its heinousness finding?  The lower courts have read this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions to say that in a nonweighing State the answer <em>must</em> be \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d; but in a weighing State the answer <em>might </em>be \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Question Two:</em> Given the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 answer to Question One, is California a nonweighing State?  If so, the reviewing court can assume, without going further, that the error arising out of the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s having listed an invalid aggravator was harmless.  Or is California a weighing State?  If so, the reviewing court should have gone further and determined whether the error was <em>in fact</em> harmless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would answer Question Two by holding that the lower courts have misunderstood this Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Question One.  Despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s occasional suggestion to the contrary, the weighing/nonweighing distinction has little to do with the need to determine whether the error was harmless.  Moreover, given \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98acute need\xe2\x80\x99 for reliable decisionmaking when the death penalty is at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Deck </em>v. <em>Missouri</em>, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 10), reviewing courts should decide if that error was harmful, regardless of the form a State\xe2\x80\x99s death penalty law takes.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To distinguish between weighing and nonweighing<em> </em>States for purposes of determining whether to apply harmless-error analysis is unrealistic, impractical, and legally unnecessary.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Use of the distinction is unrealistic because it is unrelated to any plausible conception of how a capital sentencing jury actually reaches its decision.  First, consider the kind of error here at issue.  It is not an error about the improper admission of evidence.  See <em>infra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  It is an error about the importance a jury might attach to certain admissible evidence.  Using the metaphor of a \xe2\x80\x9cthumb on death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale,\xe2\x80\x9d we have identified the error as the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility not only of randomness but also of bias in favor of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stringer</em> v. <em>Black,</em> 503 U. S., at 236; see <em>Sochor</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/527/index.html">504 U. S. 527</a>, 532 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cEmploying an invalid aggravating factor in the weighing process creates the possibility of randomness by placing a thumb on death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale, thus creating the risk of treating the defendant as more deserving of the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d (citations and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, consider why that error could affect a decision to impose death.  If the error causes harm, it is because a jury has given special weight to its finding of (or the evidence that shows) the invalid \xe2\x80\x9caggravating factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury might do so because the judge or prosecutor led it to believe that state law attaches particular importance to that factor: Indeed, why else would the State call that factor an \xe2\x80\x9caggravator\xe2\x80\x9d and/or permit it to render a defendant death eligible? See <em>Zant</em> v. <em>Stephens,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/862/index.html">462 U. S. 862</a>, 888 (1983) (recognizing that statutory label \xe2\x80\x9carguably might have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that jury may consider the aggravating label \xe2\x80\x9ca legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Clemons</em> v. <em>Mississippi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/738/index.html">494 U. S. 738</a>, 753, 755 (1990) (noting that the prosecutor \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly emphasized and argued the \xe2\x80\x98especially heinous\xe2\x80\x99 factor during the sentencing hearing\xe2\x80\x9d and remanding for the Mississippi Supreme Court to conduct harmless-error review).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The risk that the jury will give greater weight at Stage Two to its Stage One finding of an aggravating factor\xe2\x80\x94a factor that, it turns out, never should have been found in the first instance\xe2\x80\x94is significant in a weighing State, for the judge will explicitly tell the jury to consider that particular aggravating factor in its decisionmaking process.  That risk may<em> </em>prove significant in a nonweighing State as well, for there too the judge may tell the jury to consider that aggravating factor in its decisionmaking process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only difference between the two kinds of States is that, in the nonweighing State, the jury can also consider other aggravating factors (which are usually not enumerated by statute).  Cf. Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa717\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x9330(b) (2004) (judge or jury \xe2\x80\x9cshall consider \xe2\x80\xa6 any mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law <em>and any of the following statutory aggravating circumstances </em>which may be supported by the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  But the potential for the same kind of constitutional harm exists in both kinds of States, namely that the jury will attach special weight to that aggravator on the scale, the aggravator that the law says should not have been there.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To illustrate this point, consider the following two statements.  <em>Statement One</em>\xe2\x80\x94The judge tells the jury in a  weighing State: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can sentence the defendant to death only if you find one, or more, of the following three aggravating circumstances, X, Y, or Z.  If you do, the law requires you to consider those aggravators and weigh them against the mitigators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Statement Two</em>\xe2\x80\x94The judge tells the jury in a nonweighing State: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can sentence the defendant to death only if you find one, or more, of the following three aggravating circumstances, X, Y, or Z.  If you do, the law permits you to consider all mitigating and aggravating evidence, including X, Y, and Z, in reaching your decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What meaningful difference is there between these two statements?  The decisionmaking process of the first jury and that of the second jury will not differ significantly: Both juries will weigh the evidence offered in aggravation and the evidence offered in mitigation.  Cf. Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn reality, all sentencers \xe2\x80\x98weigh\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  If Statement One amounts to harmful error because the prosecutor emphasized the importance of wrongfully listed factor Y, why would Statement Two not amount to similarly harmful error?  In both instances, a jury <em>might</em> put special weight upon its previous finding of factor Y.  It is not surprising that commentators have found unsatisfactory the Court\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to distinguish between the two statements for harmless-error purposes.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Steiker &amp; Steiker, Sober Second Thoughts: Reflections on Two Decades of Constitutional Regulation of Capital Punishment, 109 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 355, 386\xe2\x80\x93387 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he different doctrinal approaches to \xe2\x80\x98weighing\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98non-weighing\xe2\x80\x99 schemes are difficult to justify given that the sentencer\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process is likely to be similar under either scheme\xe2\x80\x9d); Widder, Hanging Life in the Balance: The Supreme Court and the Metaphor of Weighing in the Penalty Phase of the Capital Trial, 68 Tulane L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1341, 1363\xe2\x80\x931364, 1365 (1994) (arguing that the distinction is largely an \xe2\x80\x9cillusion\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cappears to be derived from a fixation on the literal meaning of the metaphor of weighing, [which] remains a common means of describing the capital sentencing process even in decisions of state courts that rely on the non-weighing status of their statutory schemes to uphold death sentences resting on invalid factors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinction is impractical to administer for it creates only two paradigms\xe2\x80\x94States that weigh <em>only </em>statutory aggravators and States that weigh any and all circumstances (<em>i.e.</em>, statutory and nonstatutory aggravators).  Many States, however, fall somewhere in between the two paradigms.  A State, for example, might have a set of aggravating factors making a defendant eligible for the death penalty and an additional set of sentencing factors (unrelated to the eligibility determination) designed to channel the jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  California is such a State, as it requires the jury to take into account the eligibility-related aggravating factors and 11 other sentencing factors\xe2\x80\x94including an omnibus factor that permits consideration of all of the circumstances of the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7190.3 (West 1999).  And because many States collapse Stage One (eligibility) and Stage Two (sentence selection) into a single proceeding in which the jury hears all of the evidence at the same time, those States permit the prosecution to introduce and argue any relevant evidence, including evidence related to the statutory aggravators.  Indeed, one State the Court has characterized as a weighing<em> </em>State (Mississippi) and one State the Court has characterized as a nonweighing<em> </em>State (Virginia) both fall into this intermediate category.  Miss. Code Ann. \xc2\xa799\xe2\x80\x9319\xe2\x80\x93101 (2000); Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa719.2\xe2\x80\x93264.4(B) (Lexis 2004).  Efforts to classify these varied schemes, for purposes of applying harmless-error analysis, produce much legal heat while casting little light.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedents, read in detail, do not require us to maintain this unrealistic and impractical distinction.  The Court has discussed the matter in three key cases.  In the first case, <em>Zant </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>the Court considered an error that arose in Georgia, a nonweighing State.  The Georgia Supreme Court had held that one of several statutory aggravating circumstances found by the jury\xe2\x80\x94that the defendant had a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was unconstitutionally vague.  462 U. S., at 867, and n.\xc2\xa05.  The jury, however, had also found other aggravators present, so the defendant remained eligible for death.  The Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction on the unconstitutional factor, though erroneous, \xe2\x80\x9chad \xe2\x80\x98an inconsequential impact on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision regarding the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id</em>., at 889 (quoting <em>Zant </em>v. <em>Stephens</em>, 250 Ga. 97, 100, 297 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1, 4 (1982)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court agreed with the Georgia Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  The Court conceded that the label\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9caggravating circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94created the risk that the jury <em>might </em>place too much weight on the evidence that showed that aggravator.  Indeed, it said that the statutory label \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98aggravating circumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d might \xe2\x80\x9carguably \xe2\x80\xa6 have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U. S., at 888.  But the Court concluded that, under the circumstances<em>, </em>the error was harmless.  For one thing, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s statute permitted the jury to consider more than just the specific aggravators related to Stage One.  See <em>id.</em>, at 886.  For another thing, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions did not place particular emphasis on the role of statutory aggravating circumstances in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 889 (citation omitted).  In fact, it specifically told the jury to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consider <em>all </em>facts and circumstances presented in ext[e]nuation \xe2\x80\xa6, mitigation and aggravation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Finally, there was no indication at all that either the judge or the prosecutor tried to single out the erroneous aggravator for special weight.  Because under the circumstances there was no real harm, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cany possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court in <em>Zant</em> did not say that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an improper aggravator is <em>never</em> harmless in a State like Georgia.  It did say that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the improper aggravator was harmless <em>under the circumstances of that case</em>.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed discussion of the jury instructions is inconsistent with a rule of law that would require an <em>automatic </em>conclusion of \xe2\x80\x9charmless error\xe2\x80\x9d in States with death penalty laws like Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s.  See <em>id.</em>, at 888\xe2\x80\x93889, and n.\xc2\xa025; see also <em>id.</em>, at 891 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing scheme, <em>and under the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions in this case</em>, no suggestion is made that the presence of more than one aggravating circumstance should be given special weight\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent in <em>Zant </em>also clearly understood the principal opinion to have conducted a harmless-error analysis.  <em>Id.</em>, at 904\xe2\x80\x93905 (opinion of Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J.).  And the Court repeated this same understanding in a case decided<em> </em>only<em> two weeks</em> <em>later</em>.  <em>Barclay</em> v. <em>Florida,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/939/index.html">463 U. S. 939</a>, 951, n.\xc2\xa08 (1983) (plurality opinion) (upholding death sentence and concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cwe need not apply the type of federal harmless-error analysis that was necessary in <em>Zant\xe2\x80\x9d</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second case, <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>Mississippi,</em> involved a weighing State, Mississippi.  The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence \xe2\x80\x9ceven though the jury instruction regarding one of the aggravating factors pressed by the State, that the murder was \xe2\x80\x98especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\xe2\x80\x99 was constitutionally invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 741.  Finding it unclear whether the state court reweighed the aggravating and mitigating evidence or conducted harmless-error review, the Court vacated and remanded to the Mississippi Supreme Court to conduct either procedure (or to remand to a sentencing jury) in the first instance.  <em>Id.</em>, at 754.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As far as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d analysis reveals, the reason the Court remanded\xe2\x80\x94the reason it thought the error might not be harmless\xe2\x80\x94had nothing to do with the fact that Mississippi was a so-called weighing State.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa03.  Rather, the Court thought the error might be harmful because \xe2\x80\x9cthe State repeatedly emphasized and argued the \xe2\x80\x98especially heinous\xe2\x80\x99 factor during the sentencing hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d in stark contrast to the \xe2\x80\x9clittle emphasis\xe2\x80\x9d it gave to the other valid aggravator found by the jury.  494  U.

S. 288</a> (1989), does the rule that a vague aggravating circumstance violates the Eighth Amendment apply to a weighing State like Mississippi in the same way it applies to a nonweighing State like Georgia?  The Court answered this question \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  In so doing, it described the difference between Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s system and Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s system as follows:</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn a nonweighing State so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty.  Assuming a determination by the state appellate court that the invalid factor would not have made a difference to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination, there is no constitutional violation resulting from the introduction of the invalid factor in an earlier stage of the proceedings</em>.  But when the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale.  When the weighing process itself has been skewed, only constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level suffices to guarantee that the defendant received an individualized sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 232 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first sentence in this statement is the first and only suggestion in our cases that the submission of a vague aggravating circumstance to a jury can <em>never </em>result in constitutional error in a nonweighing State.  Indeed, the term \xe2\x80\x9cnonweighing State,\xe2\x80\x9d and the significance attached to it, does not appear in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence prior to <em>Stringer</em>.  The second sentence in the statement is less categorical than the first.  It suggests that a state appellate court would have to make some form of a harmless-error inquiry to satisfy itself that the invalidated factor \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have made a difference to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination\xe2\x80\x9d before it could conclude that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno constitutional violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Given this errant language in <em>Stringer</em>, I agree that it is \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot surprisin[g]\xe2\x80\x9d that the lower courts have since operated under the assumption \xe2\x80\x9cthat different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States,\xe2\x80\x9d and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa03.  My point is simply that such an assumption is unfounded based on our prior cases. And regardless of the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of our precedents, I think it more important that our own decisions have not repeated <em>Stringer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of those precedents.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Tuggle</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/10/index.html">516 U. S. 10</a>, 11 (1995) <em>(per curiam)</em> (characterizing <em>Zant</em> as holding \xe2\x80\x9cthat a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances <em>need not always</em> be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated in Parts II\xe2\x80\x93A and II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>, I would not take a single ambiguous sentence of dicta and derive from it a rule of law that is unjustified and that, in cases where the error is in fact harmful, would deprive a defendant of a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that I would require a reviewing court to examine whether the jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an unconstitutional aggravating factor was harmful, regardless of whether the State is a weighing State or a nonweighing State. <em> </em>I would hold that the fact that a State is a nonweighing State may make the possibility of harmful error less likely, but it does not excuse a reviewing court from ensuring that the error was <em>in fact </em>harmless.  Our cases in this area do not require a different result.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches a somewhat similar conclusion.  It, too, would abolish (or at least diminish the importance of) the weighing/nonweighing distinction for purposes of harmless-error analysis.  But then, surprisingly, it also diminishes the need to conduct any harmless-error review at all.  If all the evidence was properly admitted and if the jury can use that evidence when it considers other aggravating factors, any error, the Court announces, must be harmless.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7 (holding that when \xe2\x80\x9cone of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that underlie the invalidated aggravating factor, a reviewing court need not apply harmless-error review).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common sense suggests, however, and this Court has explicitly held, that the problem before us is <em>not </em>a problem of the admissibility of certain evidence.  It is a problem of the emphasis given to that evidence by the State or the trial court.  If that improper emphasis is strong enough, it can wrongly place a \xe2\x80\x9cthumb on death\xe2\x80\x99s side of the scale\xe2\x80\x9d at Stage Two (sentencing).  That is what the Court <em>said</em> in <em>Stringer, </em>that is what the Court <em>necessarily implied</em> in <em>Zant, </em>and that is what the Court <em>held </em>in <em>Clemons. </em> I believe the Court is right to depart from the implication of an errant sentence in <em>Stringer</em>.  But it is wrong to depart without explanation from <em>Clemons\xe2\x80\x99 </em>unanimous holding\xe2\x80\x94a holding that at least two Members of this Court have explicitly recognized as such.  See <em>Pensinger</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/930/index.html">502 U. S. 930</a>, 931 (1991) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., joined by Kennedy, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98especially heinous\xe2\x80\x99 instruction did not change the mix of evidence presented to the jury in <em>[Clemons]</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat fact alone did not support a finding of harmlessness\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court cannot reconcile its holding with <em>Clemons</em>.  That opinion makes clear that the issue is one of emphasis, not of evidence.  Indeed, the Court explicitly disavowed the suggestion that Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creliance on the \xe2\x80\x98especially heinous\xe2\x80\x99 factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding.  All of the circumstances surrounding the murder already had been aired during the guilt phase of the trial and a jury clearly is entitled to consider such evidence in imposing [the] sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 754\xe2\x80\x93755, n.\xc2\xa05.  And the entire Court agreed that the potentially improper emphasis consisted of the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State repeatedly emphasized and argued the \xe2\x80\x98especially heinous\xe2\x80\x99 factor during the sentencing hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d while placing \xe2\x80\x9clittle emphasis\xe2\x80\x9d on the sole valid aggravator of robbery for pecuniary gain.  <em>Id</em>., at 753\xe2\x80\x93754; see also <em>id</em>., at 773, n.\xc2\xa023 (Blackmun, J., joined by Marshall and Stevens, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only answer is to assert that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Clemons</em> maintains the distinction envisioned in <em>Zant</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03 (citing <em>Clemons</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 745).  But <em>Clemons</em> did no such thing.  Although the Court did observe the differences between the statutory schemes of Georgia and Mississippi, it certainly did not, as the Court claims, suggest that harmless-error analysis should <em>never </em>be conducted in the former and <em>always</em> be conducted in the latter.  Rather, the Court made the unremarkable statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a State like Georgia, where aggravating circumstances serve only to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty and not to determine the punishment, the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance <em>does not</em> <em>necessarily</em> require  an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clemons</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 744\xe2\x80\x93745 (emphasis added).  Of course, the implication of the qualifier \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d is that, in some cases, a jury\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of an invalidated aggravating circumstance <em>might</em> require that a death sentence be vacated, even \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a State like Georgia.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, an inquiry based solely on the admissibility of the underlying evidence is inconsistent with our previous cases.  And as explained above, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937, the potential for a tilting of the scales toward death is present even in those States (like Georgia and Virginia) that permit a jury to consider all of the circumstances of the crime.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may well be that the errors at issue in this case were harmless.  The State of California did not ask us to consider the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view, and I have not done so.  Given the fact that I (like the Court in this respect) would abolish the weighing/nonweighing distinction, and in light of the explanation of the kind of error at issue, I would remand this case and require the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its entire decision in light of the considerations I have described.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
