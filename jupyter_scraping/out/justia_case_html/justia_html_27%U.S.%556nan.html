S. 564</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>As an objection was made to the jurisdiction of the Court in this case, it may be proper, in order to prevent a possible misunderstanding of the principle on which jurisdiction is sustained, briefly to state it.</p>\n<p>The bill is filed in the Court of the United States sitting in Kentucky by aliens and by a citizen of Pennsylvania.  The defendants are citizens of Kentucky, except one who is a citizen of Ohio, on whom process was served in Ohio.  The jurisdiction of the court cannot be questioned so far as respects the alien plaintiffs.  As between the citizen of Pennsylvania and of Ohio, neither of them being a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought, the court could exercise no jurisdiction.  Had the cause come on for a hearing in this state of parties, a decree could not have been made in it for the want of jurisdiction.  The name of the citizen plaintiff, however, was struck out of the bill before the cause was brought before the court, and the question is whether the original defect was cured by this circumstance, whether the court, having jurisdiction over all the parties then in the cause, could make a decree.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the defendants maintain the negative of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 27 U. S. 565</a></p><p> this question.  They contend that jurisdiction depends on the state of the parties at the commencement of the suit, and that no subsequent change can give or take it away.  They say that if an alien becomes a citizen pending the suit, the jurisdiction which was once vested is not divested by this circumstance.  So if a citizen sue a citizen of the same state, he cannot give jurisdiction by removing himself and becoming a citizen of a different state.</p>\n<p>This is true, but the Court does not understand the principle to be applicable to the case at bar.  Where there is no change of party, a jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit.  The court in the first case had complete original jurisdiction; in the last, it had no jurisdiction either in form or substance.  But if an alien should sue a citizen, and should omit to state the character of the parties in the bill, though the court could not exercise its jurisdiction while this defect in the bill remained, yet it might, as is every day\'s practice, be corrected at any time before the hearing, and the court would not hesitate to decree in the cause.</p>\n<p>So in this case.  The substantial parties plaintiffs, those for whose benefit the decree is sought, are aliens, and the court has original jurisdiction between them and all the defendants.  But they prevented the exercise of this jurisdiction by uniting with themselves a person between whom and one of the defendants the court cannot take jurisdiction.  Strike out his name as a complainant, and the impediment is removed to the exercise of that original jurisdiction which the court possessed between the alien plaintiffs and all the citizen defendants.  We can perceive no objection founded in convenience or in law to this course.</p>\n<p>Upon examining the record, the judges are divided in opinion on the question whether the defendants, who are purchasers, have taken the lands charged with the equity which was attached to it while in possession of Campbell and his heirs or are to be considered as purchasers without notice. It would be useless to state the arguments and facts in support of each opinion.  The decree is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed by a divided Court.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
