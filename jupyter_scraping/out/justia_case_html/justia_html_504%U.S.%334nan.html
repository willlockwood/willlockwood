An Alabama Act imposes, <i>inter alia, </i>a fee on hazardous wastes disposed of at in-state commercial facilities, and an additional fee on hazardous wastes generated outside, but disposed of inside, the State. Petitioner filed suit in state court, requesting declaratory relief against respondent state officials and seeking to enjoin the Act\'s enforcement. The trial court declared, among other things, that the additional fee violated the Commerce Clause, finding that the only basis for the fee is the waste\'s origin. The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that the fee advanced legitimate local purposes that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.</p><p>Held:</p><p>1.

The State Act\'s additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated outside Alabama, and the Act has plainly discouraged the full operation of petitioner\'s facility. Such a burdensome tax imposed on interstate commerce alone is generally forbidden and is typically struck down without further inquiry.

Alabama\'s concern about the volume of waste entering the Emelle facility could be alleviated by less discriminatory means-such as applying an additional fee on all hazardous waste disposed of within Alabama, a per-mile tax on all vehicles transporting such waste across state roads, or an evenhanded cap on the total ton-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="335">335</a></p><p>nage landfilled at Emelle-which would curtail volume from all sources.

Even possible future financial and environmental risks to be borne by Alabama do not vary with the waste\'s State of origin in a way allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened. Pp. 343-346.</p><p>(c) This Court\'s decisions regarding quarantine laws do not counsel a different conclusion. The additional fee may not legitimately be deemed a quarantine law because Alabama permits both the generation and landfilling of hazardous waste within its borders and the importation of additional hazardous waste.

We reverse.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Petitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Oak Brook, Illinois, owns and operates one of the Nation\'s oldest commercial hazardous waste land disposal facilities, located in Emelle, Alabama. Opened in 1977 and acquired by petitioner in 1978, the Emelle facility is a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operating pursuant to permits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EP A) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2795, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6901 <i>et seq., </i>and the Toxic Substances Control Act, 90 Stat. 2003, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2601 <i>et seq. </i>(1988 ed. and Supp. II), and by the State of Alabama under Ala. Code \xc2\xa7 22-30-12(i) (1990). Alabama is 1 of only 16 States that have commercial hazardous waste landfills, and the Emelle facility is the largest of the 21 landfills of this kind located in these 16 States. Brief for National Governors\' Assn. et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>3, citing E. Smith, EI Digest 26-27 (Mar. 1992).</p><p>The parties do not dispute that the wastes and substances being landfilled at the Emelle facility "include substances that are inherently dangerous to human health and safety and to the environment. Such waste consists of ignitable, corrosive, toxic and reactive wastes which contain poisonous and cancer causing chemicals and which can cause birth defects, genetic damage, blindness, crippling and death." 1 584</p><p>1 As used in RCRA, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 6903(5), the term "hazardous waste" means:</p><p>"a solid waste, or combination of solid wastes, which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may-</p><p>"(A) cause, or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="338">338</a></p><p>So. 2d 1367, 1373 (Ala. 1991). Increasing amounts of out-ofstate hazardous wastes are shipped to the Emelle facility for permanent storage each year. From 1985 through 1989, the tonnage of hazardous waste received per year has more than doubled, increasing from 341,000 tons in 1985 to 788,000 tons by 1989. Of this, up to 90% of the tonnage permanently buried each year is shipped in from other States.</p><p>Against this backdrop Alabama enacted Act No. 90-326 (Act). Ala. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722-30B-l to 22-30B-18 (1990 and Supp. 1991). Among other provisions, the Act includes a "cap" that generally limits the amount of hazardous wastes or substances2 that may be disposed of in any i-year period, and the amount of hazardous waste disposed of during the first year under the Act\'s new fees becomes the permanent ceiling in subsequent years. Ala. Code \xc2\xa7 22-30B-2.3 (1990). The cap applies to commercial facilities that dispose of over 100,000 tons of hazardous wastes or substances per year, but only the Emelle facility, as the only commercial facility operating within Alabama, meets this description. The Act also imposes a "base fee" of $25.60 per ton on all hazardous wastes and substances disposed of at commercial facilities, to be paid by the operator of the facility. Ala. Code \xc2\xa7 2230B-2(a) (Supp. 1991). Finally, the Act imposes the "additional fee" at issue here, which states in full:</p><blockquote><p>\n"For waste and substances which are generated outside of Alabama and disposed of at a commercial site for</p></blockquote><p>"(B) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed."</p><p>RCRA directs the EPA to establish a comprehensive "cradle to grave" system regulating the generation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6921-6939b, which includes identification and listing of hazardous wastes, \xc2\xa7 6921. At present, there are more than 500 such listed wastes. See 40 CFR pt. 261, subpt. D (1991).</p><p>2 "Hazardous substance(s)" and "hazardous waste(s)" are defined terms in the Act, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa722-30B-1(3) and 22-30B-1(4), but these definitions largely parallel the meanings given under federal law.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="339">339</a></p><blockquote><p>\nthe disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances in Alabama, an additional fee shall be levied at the rate of $72.00 per ton." \xc2\xa7 22-30B-2(b).</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner filed suit in state court requesting declaratory relief against respondents and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Act. In addition to state-law claims, petitioner contended that the Act violated the Commerce, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, and was pre-empted by various federal statutes. The trial court declared the base fee and the cap provisions of the Act to be valid and constitutional; but, finding the only basis for the additional fee to be the origin of the waste, the trial court declared it to be in violation of the Commerce Clause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-88a. Both sides appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the rulings concerning the base fee and cap provisions but reversed the decision regarding the additional fee. The court held that the fee at issue advanced legitimate local purposes that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives and was therefore valid under the Commerce Clause. 584 So. 2d, at 1390.</p><p>Chemical Waste Management, Inc., petitioned for writ of certiorari, challenging all aspects of the Act. Because of the importance of the federal question and the likelihood that it had been decided in a way conflicting with applicable decisions of this Court, this Court\'s Rule 10.1(c), we granted certiorari limited to petitioner\'s Commerce Clause challenge to the additional fee. 502 U. S. 1070 (1992). We now reverse.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>No State may attempt to isolate itself from a problem common to the several States by raising barriers to the free flow</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="340">340</a></p><p>of interstate trade.3 Today, in <i>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, </i>p. 353, we have also considered a Commerce Clause challenge to a Michigan law prohibiting private landfill operators from accepting solid waste originating outside the county in which their facilities operate. In striking down that law, we adhered to our decision in <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, 437 </i>U. S. 617 (1978), where we found New Jersey\'s prohibition of solid waste from outside that State to amount to economic protectionism barred by the Commerce Clause:</p><blockquote><p>\n"\'[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends. Thus, it does not matter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reduce the waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or to save remaining open lands from pollution, for we assume New Jersey has every right to protect its residents\'</p></blockquote><p>3 The Alabama Supreme Court assumed that the disposal of hazardous waste constituted an article of commerce, and the State does not explicitly argue here to the contrary. In <i>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, </i>at 359, we have reaffirmed the idea that "[s]olid waste, even if it has no value, is an article of commerce." As stated in <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a>,622-623 (1978): "All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection; none is excluded by definition at the outset .... Just as Congress has power to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are not free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement." The definition of "hazardous waste" makes clear that it is simply a grade of solid waste, albeit one of particularly noxious and dangerous propensities, see n. 1, <i>supra, </i>but whether the business arrangements between outof-state generators of hazardous waste and the Alabama operator of a hazardous waste landfill are viewed as "sales" of hazardous waste or "purchases" of transportation and disposal services, "the commercial transactions unquestionably have an interstate character. The Commerce Clause thus imposes some constraints on [Alabama\'s] ability to regulate these transactions." <i>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, </i>at 359. See <i>National Solid Wastes Management Assn. </i>v. <i>Alabama Dept. of Environmental Mgmt., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/910/713/">910 F.2d 713</a>, 718-719 (CAll 1990), modified, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/924/1001/">924 F.2d 1001</a>, cert. denied, 501 U.

And it may be assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue those ends by slowing the flow of <i>all </i>waste into the State\'s remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce may incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey\'s ultimate purpose, it may not be accompanied by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently. Both on its face and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of nondiscrimination.</p><p>"\'The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whether the ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steady supply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinous outside competition, <i>Baldwin </i>v.

Here, the additional fee applies only to interstate hazardous waste, but at all points from its entrance into Alabama until it is landfilled at the Emelle facility, every concern related to quarantine applies perforce to local hazardous waste, which pays no additional fee.

See <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a>, 629 (1978) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting). In a case also decided today, I express my further view that States may take actions legitimately directed at the preservation of the State\'s natural resources, even if those actions incidentally work to disadvantage some out-of-state waste generators. See <i>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, </i>p. 368 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). I dissent today, largely for the reasons I have set out in those two cases. Several additional comments that pertain specifically to this case, though, are in order.</p><p>Taxes are a recognized and effective means for discouraging the consumption of scarce commodities-in this case the safe environment that attends appropriate disposal of hazardous wastes. Cf. 26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4681, 4682 (1988 ed., Supp. III) (tax on ozone-depleting chemicals); 26 U. S. C. \xc2\xa74064 (gas guzzler excise tax). I therefore see nothing unconstitutional in Alabama\'s use of a tax to discourage the export of this commodity to other States, when the commodity is a public good that Alabama has helped to produce. Cf. <i>Fort Gratiot, post, </i>at 372 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). Nor do I see any significance in the fact that Alabama has chosen to adopt a differential tax rather than an outright ban. Nothing in the Commerce Clause requires Alabama to adopt an "all or nothing" regulatory approach to noxious materials coming</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="350">350</a></p><p>from without the State. See <i>Mintz </i>v. <i>Baldwin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/346/case.html">289 U. S. 346</a> (1933) (upholding State\'s <i>partial </i>ban on cattle importation).</p><p>In short, the Court continues to err by its failure to recognize that waste-in this case admittedly <i>hazardous </i>wastepresents risks to the public health and environment that a State may legitimately wish to avoid, and that the State may pursue such an objective by means less Draconian than an outright ban. Under force of this Court\'s precedent, though, it increasingly appears that the only avenue by which a State may avoid the importation of hazardous wastes is to ban such waste disposal altogether, regardless of the waste\'s source of origin. I see little logic in creating, and nothing in the Commerce Clause that requires us to create, such perverse regulatory incentives. The Court errs in substantial measure because it refuses to acknowledge that a safe and attractive environment is the commodity really at issue in cases such as this. See <i>Fort Gratiot, post, </i>at 369, n. (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). The result is that the Court today gets it exactly backward when it suggests that Alabama is attempting to "isolate itself from a problem common to the several States." <i>Ante, </i>at 339. To the contrary, it is the 34 States that have no hazardous waste facility whatsoever, not to mention the remaining 15 States with facilities all smaller than Emelle, that have isolated themselves.</p><p>There is some solace to be taken in the Court\'s conclusion, <i>ante, </i>at 344-345, that Alabama may impose a substantial fee on the disposal of all hazardous waste, or a per-mile fee on all vehicles transporting such waste, or a cap on total disposals at the Emelle facility. None of these approaches provide Alabama the ability to tailor its regulations in a way that the State will be solving only that portion of the problem that it has created. See <i>Fort Gratiot, post, </i>at 370-371 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting). But they do at least give Alabama some mechanisms for requiring waste-generating States to compensate Alabama for the risks the Court declares Alabama must run.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="351">351</a></p><p>Of course, the costs of any of the proposals that the Court today approves will be less than fairly apportioned. For example, should Alabama adopt a fiat transportation or disposal tax, Alabama citizens will be forced to pay a disposal tax equal to that faced by dumpers from outside the State. As the Court acknowledges, such taxes are a permissible effort to recoup compensation for the risks imposed on the State. Yet Alabama\'s general tax revenues presumably already support the State\'s various inspection and regulatory efforts designed to ensure the Emelle facility\'s safe operation. Thus, Alabamians will be made to pay twice, once through general taxation and a second time through a specific disposal fee. Permitting differential taxation would, in part, do no more than recognize that, having been made to bear all the risks from such hazardous waste sites, Alabama should not in addition be made to pay <i>more </i>than others in supporting activities that will help to minimize the risk.</p><p>Other mechanisms also appear open to Alabama to achieve results similar to those that are seemingly foreclosed today. There seems to be nothing, for example, that would prevent Alabama from providing subsidies or other tax breaks to domestic industries that generate hazardous wastes. Or Alabama may, under the market participant doctrine, open its own facility catering only to Alabama customers. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>White </i>v. <i>Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/204/case.html">460 U. S. 204</a>, 206-208 (1983); <i>Reeves, Inc. </i>v. <i>Stake, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U. S. 429</a>, 436-437 (1980); <i>Hughes </i>v. <i>Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 </i>U. S. 794, 810 (1976). But certainly we have lost our way when we require States to perform such gymnastics, when such performances will in turn produce little difference in ultimate effects. In sum, the only sure byproduct of today\'s decision is additional litigation. Assuming that those States that are currently the targets for large volumes of hazardous waste do not simply ban hazardous waste sites altogether, they will undoubtedly continue to search for a way to limit their risk from sites in operation. And each new arrange-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="352">352</a></p><p>ment will generate a new legal challenge, one that will work to the principal advantage only of those States that refuse to contribute to a solution.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
