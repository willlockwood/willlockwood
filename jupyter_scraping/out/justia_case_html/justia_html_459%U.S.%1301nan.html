The trial judge had, pursuant to state statute, informed the sentencing jury that a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole may be commuted by the Governor to a sentence that permits parole.  The California Supreme Court vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding on the ground that respondent was denied due process in violation of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  30 Cal.3d 553, 639 P.2d 908.</p>\n<p>In March 1982, the State of California applied for a stay of the California Supreme Court\'s judgment.  I referred the application to the full Court, which denied the stay.  455 U.S. 1011.  In April, the State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.  On October 4, 1982, the Court granted the petition for certiorari, <em>ante</em> p. 821, and California now has reapplied for a stay.  It states that the new penalty proceeding is scheduled to begin on November 8, 1982.  Respondent has stated that he does not object to issuance of a stay.</p>\n<p>I have therefore decided that petitioner\'s reapplication for a stay pending disposition of the case by this Court should be granted.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
