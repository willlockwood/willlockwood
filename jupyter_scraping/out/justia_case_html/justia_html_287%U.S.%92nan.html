JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit in equity brought by respondent in the District Court for Southern New York to recover from Morris Schoenthal $500 and from Fannie Schoenthal $1,000 paid them by the bankrupt.  The bill alleged facts sufficient to show that each of these payments operated as a preference under \xc2\xa7 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 96(b), asserted that plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, and prayed decree declaring the payments preferential and directing defendants to account for and pay to plaintiff the amounts so received with interest and costs.  October 27, 1930, defendants separately answered and put in issue all the allegations of the bill.</p>\n<p>The case was advanced to the February, 1931, calendar.  February 13, invoking equity rule 22, defendants, on petition and notice of motion to be heard four days </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 287 U. S. 94</a></p><p> later, applied for an order transferring the suit to the law side of the court and for a trial by jury.  On the return day, the application was referred to the judge sitting in equity, and was taken up February 24.  After hearing counsel, the court denied the motion and immediately proceeded to trial in equity.  It heard evidence, filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered judgment that plaintiff recover from Morris Schoenthal $538.74 and from Fannie Schoenthal $1,075.84, and have executions therefor.  The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>The principal question is whether, assuming they made timely application under Rule 22, defendants were entitled to have the suit tried at law.</p>\n<p>Section 267 of the Judicial Code provides:</p>\n<p>"Suits in equity shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 384.  That rule has always been followed in courts of equity.  The enactment gives it emphasis, and indicates legislative purpose that it shall not be relaxed.  <em>New York Guaranty Co. v.

In England, long prior to the enactment of our first Judiciary Act, common law actions of trover and money had and received were resorted to for the recovery of preferential payments by bankrupts. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Suits to recover preferences constitute no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 287 U. S. 95</a></p><p> part of the proceedings in bankruptcy, but concern controversies arising out of it.  <em>Taylor v.

And, in absence of a clear showing that a court of law lacks capacity to give the relief which the allegations show plaintiff entitled to have, a suit in equity cannot be maintained.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/28/210/case.html">Boyce v.

The preferences sued for were money payments of ascertained and definite amounts.  The bill discloses no facts that call for an accounting or other equitable relief.  It is clear that there may be had at law a remedy "as practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration, as the remedy in equity."  <em>Boyce v. Grundy, ubi supra.</em>  The contention that \xc2\xa7 267 prohibits the maintenance of this suit in equity is sustained in principle by numerous decisions of this Court. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And, upon the very question here presented, the weight of judicial opinion in the lower federal courts [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and in the state courts [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] is that suits such as this cannot be sustained in equity. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 287 U.

Undoubtedly they might have waived that right.  <em>Reynes v. Dumont,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/130/354/case.html">130 U.

But the record discloses no act or omission of theirs at all inconsistent with their denial by answer of the assertion in the bill that plaintiff had no remedy at law or, to suggest that they were willing that the case should be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 287 U. S. 97</a></p><p> tried in equity.  Their application was noticed to be heard about a week before the case was reached for trial.  It is not shown that they delayed the hearing of the motion.  Presumably the matter was referred to the judge sitting in equity to serve the convenience of the court.  The rule directs the transfer if "at any time" it shall appear that the suit should have been brought as an action at law.  An application for transfer brought on for hearing before the commencement of the trial is not too late.  <em>Parkerson v. Borst,</em> 251 F. 242, 245.
