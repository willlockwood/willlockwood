United States, 495 U.S.  423 (1990)</h3><p><b>North Dakota v. United States</b></p><p><b>No. 88-926</b></p><p><b>Argued Oct. 31, 1989</b></p><p><b>Decided May 21, 1990</b></p><p><b>495 U.S. 423</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The United States and North Dakota exercise concurrent jurisdiction over two military bases on which the Department of Defense (DoD) operates clubs and package stores.  In 1986, in order to reduce the price the military pays for alcoholic beverages sold on such bases, Congress passed a statute directing that distilled spirits be "procured from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered."  A DoD regulation also requires that alcohol purchases be made in such a manner as to obtain "the most advantageous contract, price and other considered factors."  Although the regulation promises cooperation with state officials, it denies any obligation to submit to state control or to make purchases from in-state or state-prescribed suppliers.  Since long before 1986, North Dakota has maintained a liquor importation and distribution system, under which, <em>inter alia,</em> out-of-state distillers/suppliers may sell only to state-licensed wholesalers or federal enclaves, while licensed wholesalers may sell to licensed retailers, other licensed wholesalers, and federal enclaves.  One state regulation requires that all persons bringing liquor into the State file monthly reports, and another requires that out-of-state distillers selling directly to a federal enclave affix a label to each individual item indicating that the liquor is for consumption only within the enclave.  After a number of out-of-state distillers and importers informed military officials that they would not deal with, or would increase prices to, the North Dakota bases because of the burden of complying with the two state regulations, the Government filed suit in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the regulations\' application to liquor destined for federal enclaves.  The court granted the State\'s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that there was no conflict between the state and federal regulations because the state regulations did not prevent the Government from obtaining beverages at the "lowest cost."  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the state regulations impermissibly made out-of-state distillers less competitive with local wholesalers.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em>  The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p>856 F.2d 1107 (CA8 1988), reversed.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice O\'CONNOR, concluded that the state regulations are not invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#430">495 U. S. 430</a></span>-444. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 495 U. S. 424</a></p><p></p>\n<p>(a) Under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment -- which prohibits the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquor into a State for delivery or use therein in violation of state law -- a State has no power to pass regulations that burden the Federal Government in an area or over a transaction that falls outside the State\'s jurisdiction, <em>see, e.g., Collins v. Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/518/case.html">304 U. S. 518</a></span>, but has "virtually complete control" over the importation and sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system within the State\'s jurisdiction, <em>see California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/97/case.html">445 U.

Since North Dakota\'s labeling and reporting regulations fall within the core of the State\'s power to regulate distribution under the Twenty-first Amendment, and unquestionably serve a valid state interest in prohibiting the diversion of liquor from military bases into the civilian market, they are supported by a strong presumption of validity, and should not be lightly set aside, <em>see, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/691/case.html">467 U. S. 691</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/691/case.html#714">467 U.

S. 430</a></span>-433.</p>\n<p>(b) The regulations do not violate the intergovernmental immunity doctrine.  Although they may indirectly affect the Federal Government\'s liquor costs, they do not regulate the Government directly, since they operate only against suppliers.  <em>See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/405/case.html">304 U. S. 405</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/405/case.html#422">304 U. S. 422</a></span>.  Nor do they discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals, since the regulatory regime of which they are a part actually favors the Government.  All other liquor retailers in the State are required to purchase from state-licensed wholesalers, whereas the Government alone has the <em>option</em> either to do so or to purchase from out-of-state wholesalers who have complied with the labeling and reporting requirements.  Thus, the regulatory system does not discriminate with regard to the economic burdens that result from it.  <em>See Washington v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/536/case.html">460 U. S. 536</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/536/case.html#544">460 U. S. 544</a></span>-545.

S. 434</a></span>-439.</p>\n<p>(c) Congress has not here spoken with sufficient clarity to preempt North Dakota\'s attempt to protect its liquor distribution system.  The language of the federal procurement statutes does not expressly preempt the state reporting and labeling regulations or address the problem of unlawful diversion.  The state regulations do not directly prevent the Government from obtaining covered liquor "from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered," but merely raise the price charged by the most competitive source, out-of-state shippers.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#439">495 U. S. 439</a></span>-441.</p>\n<p>(d) The state reporting and labeling requirements are not preempted by the DoD regulation.  That regulation does not purport to carry a greater preemptive power than the federal statutes.  Nor does the regulation\'s text purport to preempt any such laws.  Its command to the military to consider various factors in determining "the most advantageous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 495 U. S. 425</a></p><p> contract, price and other considered factors" cannot be understood to preempt state laws that merely have the incidental effect of raising costs for the military.  Although the regulation does admonish that military cooperation with local authorities should not be construed as admitting an obligation to submit to state control or to buy from in-state or state-prescribed suppliers, the North Dakota regulations do not require such actions.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#442">495 U. S. 442</a></span>-443.</p>\n<p>(e) The present record does not establish the precise burdens the reporting and labeling laws will impose on the Government, but there is no evidence that they will be substantial.  It is for Congress, not this Court, to decide whether the federal interest in procuring the most inexpensive liquor outweighs the State\'s legitimate interest in preventing diversion.  It would be an unwise and unwarranted extension of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine for the Court to hold that the burdens associated with the regulations -- no matter how trivial -- are sufficient to make them unconstitutional.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#443">495 U. S. 443</a></span>-444.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, although agreeing that the availability to the Government of the option of buying liquor from in-state distributors saves the labeling regulation from invalidity, concluded that it does so not because the Government is thereby relieved of the burden of having to pay higher prices than anyone else, but only because that option is not a course of action that the Government has a constitutional right to avoid.  The Twenty-first Amendment is binding on the Government, like everyone else, and empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler.  Since letting the Government choose between purchasing label-free bottles from such wholesalers and purchasing labeled bottles from out-of-state distillers provides the Government with greater, rather than lesser, prerogatives than those enjoyed by other liquor retailers, the labeling requirement does not discriminate against the United States, and thus does not violate any federal immunity.

Each sovereign has its own separate regulatory objectives with respect to the area over which it has authority.  The Department of Defense (DoD), which operates clubs and package stores located on those bases, has sought to reduce the price that it pays for alcoholic beverages sold on the bases by instituting a system of competitive bidding.  The State, which has established a liquor distribution system in order to promote temperance and ensure orderly market conditions, wishes to protect the integrity of that system by requiring out-of-state shippers to file monthly reports and to affix a label to each bottle of liquor sold to a federal enclave for domestic consumption.  The clash between the State\'s interest in preventing the diversion of liquor and the federal interest in obtaining the lowest possible price forms the basis for the Federal Government\'s Supremacy Clause and preemption challenges to the North Dakota regulations. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 495 U. S. 427</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The United States sells alcoholic beverages to military personnel and their families at clubs and package stores on its military bases.  The military uses revenue from these sales to support a morale, welfare, and recreation program for personnel and their families.  <em>See</em> 32 CFR \xc2\xa7 261.3 (1989); DoD Directive 1015.1 (Aug. 19, 1981).  Before December, 1985, no federal statute governed the purchase of liquor for these establishments.  From December 19, 1985, to October 19, 1986, federal law required military bases to purchase alcoholic beverages only within their home State.  <em>See</em> Pub.L. 99-190, \xc2\xa7 8099, 99 Stat. 1219.  Effective October 30, 1986, Congress eliminated the requirement that the military purchase liquor from within the State, and directed that distilled spirits be "procured from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered."  Pub.L. 99661, \xc2\xa7 313, 100 Stat. 3853, 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2488(a). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>In accordance with this statute, the Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a joint military purchasing program to buy liquor in bulk directly from the Nation\'s primary distributors who offer the lowest possible prices.  Purchases are made pursuant to a DoD regulation which provides that:</p>\n<p>"The Department of Defense shall cooperate with local, state, and federal officials to the degree that their duties relate to the provisions of this chapter.  However, the purchase of all alcoholic beverages for resale at any camp, post station, base, or other DoD installation within the United States shall be in such a manner and under such conditions as shall obtain for the government the most advantageous contract, price and other considered factors.  These other factors shall not be construed as meaning any submission to state control, nor shall cooperation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 495 U.

Under the State\'s regulatory system, there are three levels of liquor distributors:  out-of-State distillers/suppliers, state-licensed wholesalers, and state-licensed retailers.  Distillers/suppliers may sell to only licensed wholesalers or federal enclaves.  N.D.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 84-02-01-05(2) (1987).  Licensed wholesalers, in turn, may sell to licensed retailers, other licensed wholesalers, and federal enclaves.  N.D.Cent.Code 5-03-01 (1987).  Taxes are imposed at both levels of distribution.  N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 5-03-07 (1987); N.D.Cent.Code, ch. 5739.2 (Supp.1989).  In order to monitor the importation of liquor, the State since 1978 has required all persons bringing liquor into the State to file monthly reports documenting the volume of liquor they have imported.  The reporting regulation provides:</p>\n<p>"All persons sending or bringing liquor into North Dakota shall file a North Dakota Schedule A Report of all shipments and returns for each calendar month with the state treasurer.  The report must be postmarked on or before the fifteenth day of the following month."</p>\n<p>N.D.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 84-02-01-05(1) (1986).</p>\n<p>Since 1986, the State has also required out-of-state distillers who sell liquor directly to a federal enclave to affix labels to each individual item indicating that the liquor is for domestic consumption only within the federal enclave.  The labels may be purchased from the state treasurer for a small sum or printed by the distillers/suppliers themselves according </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 495 U. S. 429</a></p><p> to a state-approved format.  App. 34.  The labeling regulation provides:</p>\n<p>"All liquor destined for delivery to a federal enclave in North Dakota for domestic consumption and not transported through a licensed North Dakota wholesaler for delivery to such bona fide federal enclave in North Dakota shall have clearly identified on each individual item that such shall be for consumption within the federal enclave exclusively.

The court reasoned that there was no conflict between the state and federal regulations because the state regulations did not prevent the Government from obtaining beverages at the "lowest cost."  675 F.Supp. 555, 557 (N.D.1987).

In each of those cases, we concluded that the State has no authority to regulate in an area or over a transaction that fell outside of its jurisdiction.

In the interest of promoting temperance, ensuring orderly market conditions, and raising revenue, the State has established a comprehensive system for the distribution of liquor within its borders.  That system is unquestionably legitimate.  <em>See Carter v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/131/case.html">321 U. S. 131</a></span> (1944); <em>California Board of Equalization v. Young\'s Market Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/59/case.html">299 U. S. 59</a></span> (1936). The requirements that an out-of-state supplier which transports liquor into the State affix a label to each bottle of liquor destined for delivery to a federal enclave and that it report the volume of liquor it has transported are necessary components of the regulatory regime.  Because liquor sold at Grand Forks and Minot Air Force Bases has been purchased directly from out-of-state suppliers, neither the markup nor the state taxes paid by liquor wholesalers and retailers in North Dakota is reflected in the military purchase price.  Moreover, the federal enclaves are not governed by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 495 U. S. 433</a></p><p> state laws with respect to the sale of intoxicants; the military establishes the type of liquor it sells, the minimum age of buyers, and the days and times its package stores will be open.  The risk of diversion into the retail market and disruption of the liquor distribution system is thus both substantial and real. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  It is necessary for the State to record the volume of liquor shipped into the State and to identify those products which have not been distributed through the State\'s liquor distribution system.  The labeling and reporting requirements unquestionably serve valid state interests. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Given the special protection afforded to state liquor control policies by the Twenty-first Amendment, they are supported by a strong presumption of validity, and should not be set aside lightly.  <em>See, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v.

The Federal Government\'s attack on the regulations is based on both grounds of invalidity.</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the state provisions governing the distribution of liquor by out-of-state shippers "regulate" governmental actions, and are therefore invalid directly under the Supremacy Clause.  The argument is unavailing.  State tax laws, state licensing provisions, contract laws, even "a statute or ordinance regulating the mode of turning at the corner of streets," <em>Johnson v.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Since a regulation imposed on one who deals with the Government has as much potential to obstruct governmental functions as a regulation imposed on the Government itself, the Court has required that the regulation be one that is imposed on some basis unrelated to the object\'s status as a government contractor or supplier, that is, that it be imposed equally on other similarly situated constituents of the State.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Moreover, in analyzing the constitutionality of a state law, it is not appropriate to look to the most narrow provision addressing the Government or those with whom it deals.  A state provision that appears to treat the Government differently on the most specific level of analysis may, in its broader regulatory context, not be discriminatory.

The system applies to all liquor retailers in the State.  In this system, the Federal Government is favored over all those who sell liquor in the State.  All other liquor retailers are required to purchase from state-licensed wholesalers, who are legally bound to comply with the State\'s liquor distribution system.  N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 5-03-01.1 (1987).  The Government has the option, like the civilian retailers in the State, to purchase liquor from licensed wholesalers.  However, alone among retailers in the State, the Government also has the option to purchase liquor from out-of-state wholesalers if those wholesalers comply with the labeling and reporting regulations.

Congress has not here spoken with sufficient clarity to preempt North Dakota\'s attempt to protect its liquor distribution system.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s claim that the regulations are preempted rests upon federal statute and federal regulation.  The federal statute is 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2488, which governs the procurement of alcoholic beverages by nonappropriated fund instrumentalities.  It provides simply that purchases of alcoholic beverages for resale on military installations "shall be made from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered," \xc2\xa7 2488(a)(1), but that malt beverages and wine shall be purchased from sources within the State in which the installation is located.  It may be inferred from the latter provision as well as from the provision, elsewhere in the Code, that alcoholic beverages purchased for resale in Alaska and Hawaii must be purchased in-state, Act of Oct. 30, 1986, Pub.L. 99-591, \xc2\xa7 9090, 100 Stat. 3341-116, that Congress intended for the military to be free in the other 48 States to purchase liquor from out-of-state wholesalers.  It follows that the States may not directly restrict the military from purchasing liquor out-of-state.  That is the central lesson of our decisions in <em>Paul v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/245/case.html">371 U. S. 245</a></span> (1963); <em>United States v.

S. 441</a></p><p> another to say that they cannot pass regulations which incidentally raise the costs to the military.  Any number of state laws may make it more costly for the military to purchase liquor.  As Chief Judge Lay observed in dissent,</p>\n<p>"[c]ompliance with regulations regarding the importation of raw materials, general operations of the distillery or brewery, treatment of employees, bottling, and shipping necessarily increase the cost of liquor."</p>\n<p>856 F.2d at 1116.  Highway tax laws and safety laws may make it more costly for the military to purchase from out-of-state shippers.</p>\n<p>The language used in the 1986 procurement statute does not expressly preempt any of these state regulations or address the problem of unlawful diversion of liquor from military bases into the civilian market.  It simply states that covered alcoholic beverages shall be obtained from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered.  As the District Court observed, however, "<em>[l]owest cost\' is a relative term."  675 F.Supp. at 557.  The fact that the reporting and labeling regulations, like safety laws or minimum wage laws, increase the costs for out-of-state shippers does not prevent the Government from obtaining liquor at the most competitive price, but simply raises that price.  The procurement statute does not cut such a wide swath through state law as to invalidate the reporting and labeling regulations.\n</em></p>\n<p>In this case, the most competitive source for alcoholic beverages are out-of-state distributors, whose prices are lower than those charged by North Dakota wholesalers, regardless of whether or not the labeling and reporting requirements are enforced.  The North Dakota regulations, which do not restrict the parties from whom the Government may purchase liquor or its ability to engage in competitive bidding, but at worst raises the costs of selling to the military for certain shippers, do not directly conflict with the federal statute. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 495 U.

It is Congress -- not the Department of Defense -- that has the power to preempt otherwise valid state laws, and there is no language in the relevant statute that either preempts state liquor distribution laws or delegates to the Department of Defense the power to preempt such state laws. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor does the text of the DoD regulation itself purport to preempt any state laws.  <em>See California Coastal Comm\'n v. Granite Rock Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/572/case.html">480 U.

It directs the military to consider various factors in determining "the most advantageous contract, price and other considered factors," but that command cannot be understood to preempt state laws that have the incidental effect of raising costs for the military.  Indeed, the regulation specifically envisions some regulation by state law, for it provides that the Department "shall cooperate with local [and] state . . . officials . . . to the degree that their duties relate to the provisions of this chapter."  The regulation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 495 U. S. 443</a></p><p> does admonish that such cooperation should not be construed as an admission that the military is obligated to submit to state control or required to buy from suppliers located within the State or prescribed by the State.  The North Dakota regulations, however, do not require the military to submit to state control or to purchase alcoholic beverage from suppliers within the State or prescribed by the State.  The DoD regulation has nothing to say about labeling or reporting by out-of-state suppliers.</p>\n<p>When the Court is confronted with questions relating to military discipline and military operations, we properly defer to the judgment of those who must lead our armed forces in battle.  But in questions relating to the allocation of power between the Federal and State Government on civilian commercial issues, we heed the command of Congress without any special deference to the military\'s interpretation of that command.</p>\n<p>The present record does not establish the precise burdens the reporting and labeling regulations will impose on the Government, but there is no evidence that they will be substantial.  The reporting requirement has been in effect since 1978, and there is no evidence that it has caused any supplier to raise its costs or stop supplying the military.  Although the labeling regulation has caused a few suppliers either to adjust their prices or to cease direct shipments to the bases, there has been no showing that there are not other suppliers willing to enter the market, and there is no indication that the Government has made any attempt to secure other out-of-state suppliers.  The cost of the labels is approximately three to five cents if purchased from the state treasurer, and the distillers have the right to print their own labels if they prefer.  App. 34.  Even in the initial stage of enforcing the requirement for the two bases in North Dakota, various distillers and suppliers have already notified the state treasurer that they intend to comply with the new regulations.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 495 U.

Congress has already effected a compromise by excluding beer and wine and the States of Hawaii and Alaska from the 1986 statute.  It may also decide to prohibit labels entirely or prescribe their use on a nationwide basis.  It would be both an unwise and an unwarranted extension of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine for this Court to hold that the burdens associated with the labeling and reporting requirements -- no matter how trivial they may prove to be -- are sufficient to make them unconstitutional.

The principal point of contention is whether North Dakota\'s labeling requirement produces such discrimination.  I agree with Justice STEVENS that it does not, because the Federal Government can readily avoid that discrimination against its contractors by purchasing its liquor from in-state distributors, as everyone else in North Dakota must do.  I disagree with Justice STEVENS, however, as to <em>why</em> the availability of this option saves the regulation.</p>\n<p>If I understand Justice STEVENS correctly, the availability of the option suffices, in his view, whether or not North Dakota would have the power to prevent the Federal Government from purchasing liquor directly from out-of-state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 495 U. S. 445</a></p><p> suppliers.  So long as the Federal Government does not have to pay more tax than North Dakota citizens in order to obtain liquor, the principle of governmental immunity is not offended.

S. 536</a></span> (1983), in which we upheld a state scheme for taxing building materials in which the Federal Government\'s business partners paid a tax other market participants did not.  There the State normally imposed a tax upon the landowner for the purchase of construction materials.  Since it could not constitutionally do so where the Federal Government was the landowner, it imposed the tax instead upon the building contractor, though at a lower rate than the tax applicable to landowners.  We upheld the contractor tax on the ground that the net result accorded the Federal Government treatment no worse than that received by its private-sector counterparts; at worst, it would have to reimburse its contractors for the tax paid, in which event (because of the lower rate for the contractor tax) it would still be better off than the private landowner.  460 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/536/case.html#542">460 U. S. 542</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As an original matter, I am not sure I would have agreed with the approach we took in <em>Washington,</em> for reasons of both principle and practicality.  As a matter of principle, if (as we recognized in <em>Washington</em>) the Federal Government has a constitutional entitlement to its immunity from direct State taxation, then it seems to me the State cannot require it to "pay" for that entitlement by bearing the burden of an indirect tax directed at it alone.  And as a matter of practicality, a jurisdictional issue (the jurisdiction to tax) should not turn upon a factor that is, as a general matter, so difficult to calculate as the Federal Government\'s "net" position.  But today\'s case is, in any event, distinguishable from <em>Washington</em> in that the difficulty of calculation is not only an accurate general prediction, but a reality on the facts before us.  Unlike in <em>Washington,</em> where the relative burdens placed on the Federal Government and its private sector counterparts were easily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 495 U. S. 446</a></p><p> compared (one could simply look at the tax rates), North Dakota\'s labeling requirement cannot be directly measured against the taxes imposed on other participants in the State\'s liquor market.  One might, with some difficulty, determine the cost of compliance with the labeling requirement, and uphold the regulation if that cost is less than the taxes imposed upon non-federal purchasers.  But under that approach, the constitutionality of North Dakota\'s regulation might vary year to year as the cost of compliance (the cost of buying and affixing labels) fluctuates.  I do not think <em>Washington</em> compels us to uphold a regulatory requirement uniquely imposed on federal contractors that is so different from the offsetting burden on private market participants as to require difficult and periodic computation of relative burden.</p>\n<p>This problem of comparability of burden does not trouble Justice STEVENS because, he says, the rule of <em>Washington</em> is satisfied in this case because the Federal Government is given the option of purchasing label-free liquor from in-state distributors, and thus (by definition) the <em>option</em> of not carrying a higher financial burden than anyone else.  That approach carries <em>Washington</em> one step further (though, I must admit, a logical step further) down the line of analysis that troubled me about the case in the first place.  <em>Washington</em> said (erroneously, in my view) that you can impose a discriminatory indirect tax, so long as it is no higher than the general direct tax which the Federal Government has a constitutional right to avoid.  But if economic comparability is the touchstone, reasons Justice STEVENS -- that is, if everything is OK so long as the Federal Government pays no more taxes than anyone else -- then it should follow that you can impose a discriminatory indirect tax that is even <em>greater</em> than the constitutionally avoided direct tax so long as the Federal Government is given the <em>option</em> of paying the direct tax instead.  I would not make that extension, however reasonable it may be.  Suffering a discriminatory imposition in the precise amount of the constitutionally avoidable tax is not the same </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 495 U. S. 447</a></p><p> in kind (though it may well be the same in effect) as suffering a discriminatory imposition in a higher amount with the option of escaping it by paying the constitutionally avoidable tax.  If, therefore, in the present case, the State could not compel the Federal Government to purchase its liquor from in-state distributors, then I do not think it could force the Federal Government to choose between paying for a discriminatory labeling requirement and purchasing from in-state suppliers.</p>\n<p>I ultimately agree with Justice STEVENS, however, that the existence of the option in the present case saves the discriminatory regulation -- but only because the option of buying liquor from in-state distributors (unlike the option of paying a direct tax in <em>Washington</em>) is not a course of action that the Federal Government has a constitutional right to avoid.  The Twenty-First Amendment, which prohibits "the transportation or importation into any State . . . for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof," is binding on the Federal Government like everyone else, and empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler.  Nothing in our Twenty-First Amendment case law forecloses that conclusion.  In all but one of the cases in which we have invalidated state restrictions on liquor transactions between the Federal Government and its business partners, the liquor was found not to be for "delivery or use" in the State because its destination was an exclusive federal enclave.  <em>See United States v. Mississippi Tax Commission,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/363/case.html">412 U. S. 363</a></span> (1973) (<em>Mississippi Tax Commission I</em>); <em>Collins v.

S. 599</a></span> (1975) (<em>Mississippi Tax Commission II</em>), we held that the State could not impose a sales tax, the legal incidence of which fell on the Federal Government, on liquor supplied to a federal military base under concurrent state-federal jurisdiction.  That decision rested on the conclusion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 495 U. S. 448</a></p><p> that the Twenty-First Amendment had not abolished the federal government\'s traditional immunity from state taxation.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/599/case.html#612">421 U. S. 612</a></span>-613.  I do not believe one must also conclude that the Twenty-First Amendment did not abolish the federal government\'s immunity from state regulation.  Federal immunity from state taxation, which has been a bedrock principle of our federal system since <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), is at least arguably consistent with the text of the Twenty-First Amendment\'s prohibition on transportation or importation in violation of state law.  Federal immunity from state liquor import regulation is not.</p>\n<p>That is not to say, of course, that the State may enact regulations that discriminate against the Federal Government.  But for reasons already adverted to, the North Dakota regulations do not do so.  In giving the Federal Government a choice between purchasing label-free bottles from in-state wholesalers or purchasing labelled bottles from out-of-state distillers, North Dakota provides an option that no other retailer in the State enjoys.  That being so, the labeling requirement for liquor destined for sale or use on nonexclusive federal enclaves does not violate any federal immunity.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN and Justice KENNEDY join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court\'s judgment that North Dakota\'s reporting requirement is lawful, but cannot join the Court in upholding that State\'s labeling requirement.  I cannot join the plurality, because it underestimates the degree to which North Dakota\'s law interferes with federal operations and derogates the Federal Government\'s immunity from such interference, which is secured by the Supremacy Clause.  I cannot join Justice SCALIA, because his approach is at odds with our decision in <em>United States v. Mississippi Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/599/case.html">421 U. S. 599</a></span> (1975) (<em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II</em>). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 495 U. S. 449</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The labeling requirement imposed by North Dakota is not a trifling inconvenience necessary to the State\'s regulatory regime.  An importer or distiller supplying the United States military bases in North Dakota must not only purchase or manufacture special labels and affix one to each bottle, it also must segregate and then track those bottles throughout the remainder of its manufacturing and distribution process.  The special label requirement throws a wrench into the firm\'s entire production system.  The cost of complying with the regulation, therefore, is far greater than the few pennies per label acknowledged by the plurality.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#428">495 U. S. 428</a></span>-429.  Five of the Government\'s suppliers have declined to continue shipping to the military bases in North Dakota as a direct result.  The five firms are the primary United States distributors for nine popular brands of liquor:  Chivas Regal scotch, Johnnie Walker scotch, Tanqueray gin, Canadian Club whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Jim Beam bourbon, Seagrams 7 Crown whiskey, Smirnoff vodka, and Jose Cuervo tequila.  The U.S. importer of Beefeaters gin agreed to continue doing business, but only at a price increase of up to $20.50 per case.  The suppliers of these brands potentially still available to fill the military\'s needs are either companies operating further down the distribution chain than these distillers and importers, who might be willing to undertake the onerous labeling requirement and duly charge the Government for their trouble, or North Dakota\'s own liquor wholesalers, who are exempt from the requirement.</p>\n<p>The labeling requirement, furthermore, cannot be considered "necessary" to the State\'s liquor regulatory regime by any definition of the term.  The State could achieve the same result in its effort to "prevent the unlawful diversion of liquor into [its] regulated intrastate markets," <em>ante</em> at 431, by instead requiring special labels on liquor shipped to in-state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 495 U. S. 450</a></p><p> wholesalers.  Such labels would accomplish precisely the same goal -- providing a means for state police to distinguish legal bottles from illegal ones -- without interfering with federal operations.  The State is also free to enforce its reporting requirement and take any other action that does not interfere with federal activities, including negotiating a mutual enforcement program with the military, which is itself governed by a regulation prohibiting the kind of diversion that the State seeks to control.  <em>See</em> DoD Directive 1015.3-R, ch. 4(F)(3) (May 1982). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>That North Dakota\'s declared purpose for implementing the regulation is to discourage and police unlawful diversion of liquor into its domestic market does not prevent this Court from ruling on its constitutionality.  To be sure, this Court has twice said that the States retain police power to regulate shipments of liquor through their territory "insofar as necessary to prevent" unlawful diversion in the absence of conflicting federal regulation.  <em>United States v. Mississippi Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/363/case.html">412 U.

Such statements were indications that this Court believed that States are not rendered utterly powerless in this respect by the dormant Commerce Clause.  We have never held, however, that any regulation with this avowed purpose is insulated from review under the federal immunity doctrine or any other constitutional ground, including the dormant Commerce Clause.  Nor have we ever upheld such a regulation, or any state regulation of liquor that clashed with some federal law or operation, on the basis </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 495 U. S. 451</a></p><p> of a "presumption of validity."  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#433">495 U. S. 433</a></span>.  Indeed, our previous, limited statements -- that States are not prevented by the Commerce Clause from regulating shipments of liquor through their territory where necessary to prevent diversion -- recognized that the regulations must be consistent with other constitutional requirements.  <em>See Mississippi Tax Comm\'n I, supra,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/363/case.html#377">412 U. S. 377</a></span> (recognizing such state power only "in the absence of conflicting federal regulation").  Since the States\' power is limited by the doctrine of federal preemption, which flows from the Supremacy Clause, then that power must also be limited by the doctrine of federal immunity, which also flows from the Supremacy Clause. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The plurality characterizes the doctrine of federal immunity as invalidating state laws only if they regulate the Federal Government directly or discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#435">495 U.

But contrary to the plurality\'s view, the rule to be distilled from our prior cases is that those dealing with the Federal Government enjoy immunity from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 495 U.

North Dakota\'s labeling regulation violates the Supremacy Clause under both standards.  It substantially obstructs federal operations, and it discriminates against the Federal Government and its chosen business partners.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The plurality recognizes that we have consistently invalidated nondiscriminatory state regulations that interfere with affirmative federal policies, including those governing procurement, but designates these cases as resting on principles of preemption.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#435">495 U.

This characterization is not only at odds with the reasoning in the opinions themselves, but suggests a rigid demarcation between the two Supremacy Clause doctrines of federal immunity and preemption which is not present in our cases.  Whether a state regulation interferes with federal objectives is, of course, a central inquiry in our traditional preemption analysis.  But when we have evaluated the validity of an obligation imposed by a State on the Federal Government and its business partners, we have justly considered whether the obligation interferes with federal operations as part of our federal immunity analysis.</p>\n<p>In <em>Leslie Miller, Inc. v.

Georgia Public Service Comm\'n, supra,</em> and <em>Paul v. United States, supra.</em>  As in those cases, the state regulation threatens to scuttle the Federal Government\'s express determination to secure products and services in the most competitive manner possible.  Federal law requires military officials to purchase distilled spirits "from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered."  10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2488(a).  In enacting this standard, Congress made a deliberate choice to permit, and generally encourage, the military to buy liquor for its bases outside the States in which they are located.  The "competitive source" provision replaced an earlier statute requiring bases to purchase all alcoholic beverages in-state.   <em>See</em> Pub.L. 99-190, \xc2\xa7 8099, 99 Stat. 1219.  The statute\'s legislative history shows that Congress determined that the military should be free to purchase distilled spirits out-of-state from the most competitive source, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 495 U.

It is not only plausible that such companies would find it more trouble than it was worth to comply with North Dakota\'s labeling requirement, five companies have already refused to fill orders for the North Dakota bases.  At least one other firm has been willing to fill orders only at a substantially increased price.  The regulation would force the military to lose some of the advantages of a highly competitive nationwide market, either because it would be subjected to special surcharges by out-of-state suppliers or forced to pay high in-state prices -- or some combination of these.  Moreover, the difficulties presented by North Dakota\'s labeling requirement would increase exponentially if additional States adopt equivalent rules, a consideration we found dispositive in <em>Public Utilities Comm\'n of California, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/534/case.html#545">355 U.

The Court concluded that, although the legal incidence of the taxes was different -- one fell on the landowners directly and the other on the federal contractors -- the tax did not discriminate against federal contractors or the Federal Government because each tax would be reflected in the fees the contractors could charge.  As a result, the Court concluded that the tax on the federal contractors cost them no more than the equivalent tax borne indirectly by their private counterparts, and very likely cost them less.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/536/case.html#541">460 U. S. 541</a></span>-542.</p>\n<p>The conclusion to be drawn from <em>Washington v. United States</em> is that North Dakota would not violate the federal immunity doctrine by placing a labeling requirement on the out-of-state distillers who supply the military bases within the State if it also imposed the same labeling requirement directly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 495 U. S. 463</a></p><p> on the in-state wholesalers for all liquor purchased out-of-state.  The plurality\'s view, that the labeling regulation is not discriminatory unless the entire North Dakota liquor regulatory system places the Federal Government at a disadvantage competing with in-state wholesalers or retailers, is a different proposition altogether.  <em>See also</em> Justice SCALIA\'s opinion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#448">495 U. S. 448</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The plurality argues that, in this case, the State compensates the Federal Government for the discriminatory labeling requirement by prohibiting private retailers from buying liquor from out-of-state suppliers, and that therefore the Government is favored over other North Dakota retailers.  There are core difficulties with this comparison.  Since the regulation is imposed on out-of-state suppliers, the regulation would affect the Federal Government when it purchases liquor from those suppliers.  The private parties within the State who are comparable, therefore, are North Dakota wholesalers who purchase liquor outside the State and resell it to the distributors and retailers farther down the distribution chain within the State -- not North Dakota retailers.</p>\n<p>The appropriate comparison between the Federal Government and its actual private counterpart -- a North Dakota wholesaler -- cannot be made with confidence.  The regulations that the plurality presumes are economically equivalent are so entirely unlike that it is wholly speculative that the impositions on in-state wholesalers are comparable to the imposition on the Federal Government and its suppliers.  Such a comparison requires us to determine whether there is greater profit in buying from out-of-state distillers at a price that does not reflect the labeling requirement while reaping only the wholesaler\'s markup, or more lucrative to buy from whomever will sell specially labeled liquor at whatever price this costs, but to reap the margin on retail sales.  Even if the comparison could be made reliably at some set moment, there is no reason to expect the result to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 495 U. S. 464</a></p><p> be the same every year; it would vary depending on the business conditions affecting each half of the equation. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>As is obvious, there is simply no assurance that North Dakota is actually regulating even-handedly when it taxes and licenses some and requires special product labels for others.  The labeling regulation is not part of a larger scheme where like obligations are imposed, albeit at different stages of commerce, on federal and nonfederal suppliers.  It is that "different situation," that we identified in <em>Washington v. United States,</em> where unlike and hard-to-compare obligations are imposed.  Contrary to the plurality\'s assertion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#438">495 U. S. 438</a></span>, <em>Washington v. United States</em> does not require or even support a finding that the regulation is constitutional.  To the contrary, when a State imposes an obligation, triggered solely by a federal transaction, that cannot be found with confidence to place the Federal Government and its contractors in as good or better a position than its counterparts in the private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 495 U.

[<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, alone, agrees with petitioner that \xc2\xa7 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] saves the labeling regulation because the regulation governs the importation of liquor into the State.  I believe, however, that the question presented in this case, whether the Twenty-first Amendment empowers States to regulate liquor shipments to military bases over which the Federal Government and a State share concurrent jurisdiction, is one we have addressed before and answered in the negative.  In <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/599/case.html">421 U.

S. 609</a></span>.  Petitioners\' reliance on this distinction, however, is misplaced.  To be sure, a tax or regulation imposed directly on the Federal Government is invariably invalid under the doctrine of federal immunity whereas a tax </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 495 U. S. 467</a></p><p> or regulation imposed on those who deal with the Government is invalid only when it actually obstructs or discriminates against federal activity.  But the labeling regulation at issue here and the tax at issue in <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II, supra,</em> violate the doctrine of federal immunity for precisely the same reason:  they burden the Federal Government in its conduct of governmental operations.  A state regulation that obstructs federal activity is invalid no matter whom it regulates.  To the extent that petitioners assume that there are two doctrines of federal immunity -- one that protects the Government from direct taxation or regulation and one that protects the Government from the indirect effects of taxes or regulations imposed on those with whom it deals -- petitioners misconstrue the law.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA argues that <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II</em> holds only that the Twenty-first Amendment did not override the Government\'s immunity from state taxation, but did not reach the question whether the Amendment also overrode federal immunity from state regulation.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#447">495 U. S. 447</a></span>-448.  I agree that the Court had only a state tax question before it in that decision, but I do not agree that the Court intended to leave the question of state regulation open.  <em>See Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II, supra,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/599/case.html#613">421 U. S. 613</a></span> (concluding that its decision that States have no power to regulate the importation of liquor into exclusive jurisdiction federal enclaves is also applicable to concurrent jurisdiction enclaves).</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA\'s argument raises two separate questions.  First, how do we separate those State liquor importation laws that the Twenty-first Amendment permits to override federal laws and other constitutional prohibitions from those laws it does not?  Second, how do we determine whether liquor is being imported into North Dakota or into a federal island within the boundaries of the State?</p>\n<p>The first is perhaps the more difficult question.  It is clear from our decisions that the power of States over liquor transactions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 495 U. S. 468</a></p><p> is not plenary, [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] even when the State is attempting to regulate liquor importation. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  To the extent that Justice SCALIA concedes that <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II</em> is decided correctly, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#447">495 U. S. 447</a></span>-448, his assumption that concurrent jurisdiction federal enclaves are within the State for Twenty-first Amendment purposes requires him to concede that, under certain circumstances, the "transportation or importation" of liquor into a State "in violation of the laws" of the State in which the enclave is located is not prohibited by the Twenty-first Amendment.  This is true because we decided that out-of-state importers and distillers could ship liquor to military bases without collecting and remitting the use tax required by Mississippi law.  Thus, Justice SCALIA\'s approach is to draw a line between taxes and regulations which, while consistent with some of our cases, is inconsistent with others such as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 495 U. S. 469</a></p><p> <em>Healy v. The Beer Institute, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/324/case.html">491 U.

I continue to agree with the Court\'s position in <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n II</em> that concurrent jurisdiction federal enclaves, like exclusive jurisdiction federal enclaves, [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] are not within a "State" for purposes of the Twenty-first Amendment.   421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/599/case.html#613">421 U. S. 613</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In addition, North Dakota appears to have ceded all of its power concerning the two federal enclaves within its boundaries, and to enjoy concurrent jurisdiction only through the grace of the United States Air Force.  As noted by the plurality, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#429">495 U. S. 429</a></span>, n. 2, the parties offer no details concerning the terms of the concurrent jurisdiction on these two bases.  But the public record fills in some quite relevant data.  North Dakota has long ceded by statute to the Federal Government full jurisdiction over any tract of land that may be acquired by the Government for use as a military post (retaining only the power to serve process within).  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 495 U. S. 470</a></p><p> N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 54-01-08 (1989).  Thus, the State ceded its jurisdiction over the Air Force Bases long since. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Moreover, North Dakota defines its own jurisdiction as extending to all places within its boundaries except, where jurisdiction has been or is ceded to the United States, the State\'s jurisdiction is "qualified by the terms of such cession or the laws under which such purchase or condemnation has been or may be made."  <em>See</em> N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 54-01-06 (1989).  Since 1970, Congress has provided that the branches of the armed services could retrocede some or all of the United States\' jurisdiction over any property administered by them if exclusive jurisdiction is considered unnecessary.  <em>See</em> 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2683.  North Dakota\'s laws permit the Governor to consent to any retrocession of jurisdiction offered.   <em>See</em> N.D.Cent.Code \xc2\xa7 54-01-09.3 (1989).</p>\n<p>Contrary to the plurality\'s suggestion, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#429">495 U. S. 429</a></span>, n. 2, we have never held that "concurrent jurisdiction" always means that the State and Federal Government each have plenary authority over the territory in question.  To the contrary, each decision cited by the plurality either does not address the question, <em>see, e.g., Mississippi Tax Comm\'n I,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/363/case.html#380">412 U.

S. 471</a></p><p> the terms of the cession of jurisdiction by the State.  <em>See James v.

Therefore, even were I to accept the proposition that a concurrent jurisdiction federal enclave might be a "State" for purposes of the Twenty-first Amendment, I would regard the State\'s authority over the North Dakota bases as an open question for which remand for further proceedings, not reversal, is the appropriate action.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because I find that North Dakota\'s labeling requirement both discriminates against the Federal Government and its suppliers and obstructs the operations of the Federal Government, I cannot agree with the Court that it is valid.

This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the constitution has declared") (invalidating a State tax that fell solely on notes issued by the Bank of the United States).  Without such immunity, Chief Justice Marshall reasoned, any State held the power to defeat federal operations because "the power to tax involves the power to destroy," <em>id.</em> at 431, and the Federal Government, unlike the state\'s citizens, has no voice in the state legislature with which to guard against abuse.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#428">17 U.

The California regulation could not have been characterized as discriminatory.  Carriers were permitted to contract with the United States on the same terms as with any other customer; they were just required to obtain state permission before giving the government special treatment.  355 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/534/case.html#537">355 U.

This danger would never arise, however, if the tax is also imposed on the income and property interests of all other residents and voters of the State."</p>\n<p>A "political check" "has been thought necessary because the United States does not have a direct voice in the state legislatures."  <em>Washington v.

In contrast, there is no one represented in the North Dakota state legislature to provide a political check on that State\'s liquor labeling regulation, because it affects solely out-of-state companies and the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Even if the plurality were correct that the appropriate comparison were to a North Dakota retailer, so long as the Government continues to purchase liquor out-of-state, its relative position turns on another apples-and-oranges comparison.  Is it economically advantageous to reimburse out-of-state distillers for the cost of compliance with the State\'s labeling requirement, but to avoid paying a wholesaler\'s mark-up?  Or is paying the wholesaler\'s mark-up less expensive, when the base price to the wholesaler need not reflect the cost of compliance?</p>\n<p>It is true that, if the Government simply purchased liquor from North Dakota\'s own wholesalers -- at an estimated increased cost of $200.000 to $250.000 in the next year -- it would avoid the labeling requirement, and thereby occupy the same position as North Dakota retailers.  But the regulation cannot be claimed to be nondiscriminatory on the ground that the Government has the option to do what the State may not force it to do directly -- <em>i.e.,</em> purchase liquor inside the State.  Even the plurality concedes that North Dakota may not permissibly restrict the Government from purchasing liquor out of state.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/423/case.html#440">495 U. S. 440</a></span>.  Thus, to be considered nondiscriminatory, the North Dakota regulatory scheme, even under the plurality\'s approach, must place the Federal Government and its suppliers in as good a position as their North Dakota counterparts, <em>even if the Government chooses not to purchase liquor in-state.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>By contrast, North Dakota\'s reporting requirement does not discriminate against either the military bases or the distillers and importers who supply them, nor does it obstruct federal operations.  By its terms, it is imposed on "[a]ll persons sending or bringing liquor into North Dakota."  N.D.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 84-02-01-05(1) (1986).  The regulation requires all out-of-state suppliers to make monthly reports to the State, whether they sell to the Federal Government or to private firms in North Dakota.  The military\'s suppliers are in no different a position <em>vis-a-vis</em> the reporting requirement than they would be if they were supplying the private sector.  The military is in no different a position than any private firm importing liquor into North Dakota.  Nor was there any evidence introduced showing that the regulation interferes with the military\'s ability to comply with the affirmative federal policy of purchasing liquor in bulk from the most competitive sources in the country.  The reporting requirement has been in effect since 1978, and, therefore, none of the suppliers\' refusals to deal or increase of prices announced in 1986 can be attributed plausibly to this requirement alone.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The two <em>Mississippi Tax Comm\'n</em> cases required us to decide whether Mississippi constitutionally could require out-of-state liquor suppliers to collect a tax from the Federal Government on liquor shipped to four military bases within the State\'s boundaries.
