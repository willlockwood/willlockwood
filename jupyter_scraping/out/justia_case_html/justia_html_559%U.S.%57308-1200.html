A debt collector who \xe2\x80\x9cfails to comply with any [FDCPA] provision \xe2\x80\xa6 with respect to any person is liable to such person\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damage[s],\xe2\x80\x9d costs, \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as determined by the court,\xe2\x80\x9d and statutory \xe2\x80\x9cadditional damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(a).  In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), \xc2\xa741 <em>et seq</em>., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  See \xc2\xa71692<em>l</em>.  A debt collector who acts with \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to civil penalties enforced by the FTC.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A), (C).  A debt collector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however, if it \xe2\x80\x9cshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Carlisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage company to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner Jerman.  The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.  Jerman\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mortgage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Carlisle withdrew the suit.  Jerman then filed this action, contending that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writing, Carlisle had violated \xc2\xa71692g(a) of the FDCPA, which governs the contents of notices to debtors.  The District Court, acknowledging a division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated \xc2\xa71692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under \xc2\xa71692k(c)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error\xe2\x80\x9d defense.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c) is not limited to clerical or factual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The bona fide error defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c) does not apply to a violation resulting from a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A violation resulting from a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s misinterpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71692k(c).  It is a common maxim that \xe2\x80\x9cignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barlow</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 7 Pet. 404, 411.  When Congress has intended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more explicitly than here.  In particular, the administrative-penalty provisions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that the FDCPA prohibited its action.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A), (C).  Given the absence of similar language in \xc2\xa71692k(c), it is fair to infer that Congress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for \xe2\x80\x9cintentional\xe2\x80\x9d conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited.  Congress also did not confine FDCPA liability to \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d violations, a term more often understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thurston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/111/index.html">469 U. S. 111</a>, 125\xe2\x80\x93126.  Section 1692k(c)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a debt collector maintain \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error\xe2\x80\x9d also more naturally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual errors.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s context and history.  The FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s separate protection from liability for \xe2\x80\x9cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC] advisory opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense.  Moreover, in enacting the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), \xc2\xa71640(c).  At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILA\xe2\x80\x99s language into the FDCPA.  Although in 1980 Congress amended the defense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial interpretation of that provision.  It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s defense to be broader than TILA\xe2\x80\x99s, and Congress has not expressly <em>included </em>mistakes of law in any of the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.  Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s reading is not supported by <em>Heintz</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a>, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA would fall under that provision.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt-collecting lawyers.  The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in calculating additional damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Lawyers have recourse to the bona fide error defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c) when a violation results from a qualifying factual error.  To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.  Numerous state consumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.  To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its <em>amici</em> have not shown that \xe2\x80\x9cthe result [will be] so absurd as to warrant\xe2\x80\x9d disregarding the weight of textual authority.  <em>Heintz, supra</em>, at 295.  Absent such a showing, arguments that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.

Section 813(c) of the Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(c), provides that a debt collector is not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can show \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  This case presents the question whether the \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error\xe2\x80\x9d defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c) applies to a violation resulting from a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA.  We conclude it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to eliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692(e).  The Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors and \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collector[s],\xe2\x80\x9d defined to include any person who \xe2\x80\x9cregularly collects \xe2\x80\xa6 debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71692a(5), (6).  Among other things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false representations as to a debt\xe2\x80\x99s character, amount, or legal status, \xc2\xa71692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an \xe2\x80\x9cunusual time or place\xe2\x80\x9d likely to be inconvenient to the consumer, \xc2\xa71692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane language or violence or the threat thereof, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71692d(1), (2).  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71692b\xe2\x80\x931692j; <em>Heintz</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a>, 292\xe2\x80\x93293 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act is enforced through administrative action and private lawsuits.  With some exceptions not relevant here, violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741 <em>et seq</em>., and are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  See \xc2\xa71692<em>l</em>.  As a result, a debt collector who acts with \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16 CFR \xc2\xa71.98(d)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDCPA also provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with respect to any person is liable to such person.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(a).  Successful plaintiffs are entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cactual damage[s],\xe2\x80\x9d plus costs and \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as determined by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  A court may also award \xe2\x80\x9cadditional damages,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to a statutory cap of $1,000 for individual actions, or, for class actions, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(a)(2).  In awarding additional damages, the court must consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe frequency and persistence of [the debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s] noncompliance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of such noncompliance,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent to which such noncompliance was intentional.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing liability on debt collectors.

P. A., and one of its attorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle).  In April 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court on behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.  Carlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Countrywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L. Jerman.  The complaint included a \xe2\x80\x9cNotice,\xe2\x80\x9d later served on Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be assumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.  Jerman\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and Carlisle sought verification from Countrywide.  When Countrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact, already paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the foreclosure lawsuit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certification and damages under the FDCPA, contending that Carlisle violated \xc2\xa71692g by stating that her debt would be assumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  While acknowledging a division of authority on the question, the District Court held that Carlisle had violated \xc2\xa71692g by requiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing.  464 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 720, 722\xe2\x80\x93725 (ND Ohio 2006).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The court ultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, however, concluding that \xc2\xa71692k(c) shielded it from liability because the violation was not intentional, resulted from a bona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.  502 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 686, 695\xe2\x80\x93697 (ND Ohio 2007).  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  538 F.\xc2\xa03d 469 (2008).  Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are divided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cmajority view is that the defense is available for clerical and factual errors only,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held that \xc2\xa71692k(c) extends to \xe2\x80\x9cmistakes of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 473\xe2\x80\x93476 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court of Appeals found \xe2\x80\x9cnothing unusual\xe2\x80\x9d about attorney debt collectors maintaining \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law.  <em>Id.,</em> at 476.  Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(c), expressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that Congress has amended the FDCPA several times since 1977 without excluding mistakes of law from \xc2\xa71692k(c).  538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 476.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority as to the scope of the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] 557 U.

Jerman contends that when a debt collector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the violation (here, sending a notice that included the \xe2\x80\x9cin writing\xe2\x80\x9d language), a misunderstanding about what the Act requires cannot render the violation \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional,\xe2\x80\x9d given the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is no defense.  Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue that nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors from the category of \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error[s]\xe2\x80\x9d covered by \xc2\xa71692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an unintentional \xe2\x80\x9cact\xe2\x80\x9d but rather an unintentional \xe2\x80\x9cviolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The latter term, they contend, evinces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to impose liability only when a party knows its conduct is unlawful.  Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read \xc2\xa71692k(c) to encompass \xe2\x80\x9call types of error,\xe2\x80\x9d including mistakes of law.  Brief for Respondents 7.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decline to adopt the expansive reading of \xc2\xa71692k(c) that Carlisle proposes.  We have long recognized the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barlow</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see also <em>Cheek</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/192/index.html"></a><a href="/us/498/192/index.html">498 U. S. 192</a>, 199 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American legal system\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Our law is therefore no stranger to the possibility that an act may be \xe2\x80\x9cintentional\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of civil liability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge that her conduct violated the law.  In <em>Kolstad</em> v. <em>American Dental Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/526/index.html">527 U. S. 526</a> (1999), for instance, we addressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 authorizing compensatory and punitive damages for \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.

We observed that in some circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d could occur without giving rise to punitive damages liability, such as where an employer is \xe2\x80\x9cunaware of the relevant federal prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d or acts with the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct belief that its discrimination is lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U.

Such a rule would be remarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many scores of civil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code that employ such a combination of terms.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s theory draws no distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cknowing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintentional,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d and would abandon the care we have traditionally taken to construe such words in their particular statutory context.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Safeco</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 57.  More fundamentally, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rule is at odds with precedents such as <em>Bryan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 192, and <em>International Minerals</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 559, 563, in which we rejected a mistake-of-law defense when a statute imposed liability for a \xe2\x80\x9cknowing violation\xe2\x80\x9d or on those who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly violat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the law.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent posits that the word \xe2\x80\x9cintentional,\xe2\x80\x9d in the civil context, requires a higher showing of <em>mens rea</em> than \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d and thus that it should be easier to avoid liability for intentional, rather than willful, violations.  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  Even if the dissent is correct that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cintentional violation,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone in a civil liability statute, might be read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes the term \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71692k(c) with the more specific language of \xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A), which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that particular conduct was unlawful.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading gives short shrift to that textual distinction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona fide errors in \xc2\xa71692k(c) do not include mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt collector maintain \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The dictionary defines \xe2\x80\x9cprocedure\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976).  In that light, the statutory phrase is more naturally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or other such \xe2\x80\x9cregular orderly\xe2\x80\x9d steps to avoid mistakes\xe2\x80\x94for instance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector might adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate with consumers at the wrong time of day, \xc2\xa71692c(a)(1), or make false representations as to the amount of a debt, \xc2\xa71692e(2).  The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds nothing unusual in attorney debt collectors maintaining procedures to avoid legal error.  <em>Post</em>, at 18; 538 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 476.  We do not dispute that some entities may maintain procedures to avoid legal errors.  But legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process.  For this reason, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as <em>amicus curiae </em>supporting Jerman) that the broad statutory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d bona fide error indicates that the relevant procedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical or factual mistakes.  Such procedures are more likely to avoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, particularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex federal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open-ended prohibitions on, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cfalse, deceptive,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71692e, or \xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d practices, \xc2\xa71692f.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the text of \xc2\xa71692k(c), read in isolation, leaves room for doubt, the context and history of the FDCPA provide further reinforcement for construing that provision not to shield violations resulting from misinterpretations of the requirements of the Act.  See <em>Dada</em> v. <em>Mukasey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/554/1/index.html">554 U. S. 1</a>, __ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn reading a statute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but consider in connection with it the whole statute\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As described above, Congress included in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error defense but also a separate protection from liability for \xe2\x80\x9cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [FTC].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(e).  In our view, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reading is at odds with the role Congress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving ambiguities in the Act.  Debt collectors would rarely need to consult the FTC if \xc2\xa71692k(c) were read to offer immunity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel.  Indeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the law, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from claiming good-faith immunity for violations and would potentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations under the FTC Act.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  More importantly, the existence of a separate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liability when the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs against stretching the language of the bona fide error defense to accommodate Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any remaining doubt about the proper interpretation of \xc2\xa71692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning attached to the language Congress copied into the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense from a parallel provision in an existing statute.  TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several statutes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA.  As enacted in 1968, \xc2\xa7130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that was in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress later enacted into the FDCPA: \xe2\x80\x9cA creditor may not be held liable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  82 Stat. 157 (codified at 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(c)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the 9-year period between the enactment of TILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no such court interpreted TILA to extend to violations resulting from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We have often observed that when \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial interpretations as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bragdon</em> v. <em>Abbott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/624/index.html">524 U. S. 624</a>, 645 (1998); see also <em>Rowe</em> v. <em>New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/364/index.html">552 U. S. 364</a>, 370 (2008).  While the interpretations of three Federal Courts of Appeals may not have \xe2\x80\x9csettled\xe2\x80\x9d the meaning of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense, there is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it enacted the FDCPA.  Congress copied verbatim the pertinent portions of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense into the FDCPA.  Compare 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(c) (1976 ed.) with \xc2\xa7813(c), 91 Stat. 881.  This close textual correspondence supports an inference that Congress understood the statutory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance, consistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a 1980 amendment to TILA that added the following sentence to that statute\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense: \xe2\x80\x9cExamples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and program[m]ing, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under [TILA] is not a bona fide error.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, \xc2\xa7615, 94 Stat. 181.  The absence of a corresponding amendment to the FDCPA, Carlisle reasons, is evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to give a more expansive scope to the FDCPA defense.  For several reasons, we decline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpretative weight.  For one, it is not obvious that the amendment changed the scope of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense in a way material to our analysis, given the uniform interpretations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA defense does not extend to mistakes of law.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  (Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>post</em>, at 21, this reading does not render the 1980 amendment surplusage.  Congress may simply have intended to codify existing judicial interpretations to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions where courts had not yet addressed the issue.)  It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which presents at least as significant a set of concerns about imposing liability for uncertain legal obligations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ford Motor Credit Co.</em> v. <em>Milhollin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/555/index.html"></a><a href="/us/444/555/index.html">444 U. S. 555</a>, 566 (1980) (TILA is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98highly technical\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Our reluctance to give controlling weight to the TILA amendment in construing the FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not expressly <em>included </em>mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \xc2\xa71692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code.  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in Expedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding \xe2\x80\x9can error of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under that Act]\xe2\x80\x9d) with 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona fide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act that are silent as to errors of legal judgment).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Although Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the FDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting the scope of \xc2\xa71692k(c), that does not suggest Congress viewed the statute as having the expansive reading Carlisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake of law.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Riddle</em>, 305 F.\xc2\xa03d 1107, 1121\xe2\x80\x931124, and nn.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315 (CA10 2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Heintz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a>, is also unavailing.  We held in that case that the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collector\xe2\x80\x9d includes lawyers who regularly, through litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts.  <em>Id.,</em> at 292.  We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner (as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client) that our reading would automatically render liable \xe2\x80\x9cany litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim against a debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that \xc2\xa71692e(5) prohibits a debt collector from making any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98threat to take action that cannot legally be taken.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 295.  We expressed skepticism that \xc2\xa71692e(5) itself demanded such a result.  But even assuming the correctness of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona fide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for litigating lawyers was not \xe2\x80\x9cso absurd\xe2\x80\x9d as to warrant implying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statutory text.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We had no occasion in <em>Heintz</em> to address the overall scope of the bona fide error defense.  Our discussion of \xc2\xa71692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall under the bona fide error defense.  In the mine-run lawsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful because of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.  Lawyers can, of course, invoke \xc2\xa71692k(c) for violations resulting from qualifying factual errors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s remaining arguments do not change our view of \xc2\xa71692k(c).  Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between our reading of the term \xe2\x80\x9cintentional\xe2\x80\x9d in that provision and the instruction in \xc2\xa71692k(b) that a court look to whether \xe2\x80\x9cnoncompliance was intentional\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing statutory additional damages.  But assuming \xc2\xa71692k(b) encompasses errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in reading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory damages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where a debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection of the bona fide error defense.  Carlisle is also concerned that under our reading, \xc2\xa71692k(c) would be unavailable to a debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA applying to acts taken with particular intent because in such instances the relevant act would not be unintentional.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector from \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ausing a telephone to ring \xe2\x80\xa6 continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass\xe2\x80\x9d).  Including mistakes as to the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would ensure that \xc2\xa71692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA.  We see no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense must cover every provision of the Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties and <em>amici</em> make arguments concerning the legislative history that we address for the sake of completeness.  Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Committee Report stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] debt collector has no liability \xe2\x80\xa6 if he violates the act in any manner, including with regard to the act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage, when such violation is unintentional and occurred despite procedures designed to avoid such violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93382, p. 5 (1977); see also <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (discussing report).  But by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unambiguously support Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  Even if a bona fide mistake \xe2\x80\x9cwith regard to the act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage\xe2\x80\x9d could be read in isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading does not exclude mistakes of fact.  A mistake \xe2\x80\x9cwith regard to the act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage\xe2\x80\x9d may derive wholly from a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s factually mistaken belief, for example, that a particular debt arose out of a nonconsumer transaction and was therefore not \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d by the Act.  There is no reason to read this passing statement in the Senate Report as contemplating an exemption for legal error that is the product of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x94particularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collector\xe2\x80\x9d until 1986.  100 Stat. 768.  Moreover, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany manner\xe2\x80\x9d of violation is expressly qualified by the requirements that the violation be \xe2\x80\x9cunintentional\xe2\x80\x9d and occur despite maintenance of appropriate procedures.  In any event, we need not choose between these possible readings of the Senate Report, as the legislative record taken as a whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s view.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We therefore decline to give controlling weight to this isolated passage.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carlisle, its <em>amici</em>, and the dissent raise the additional concern that our reading will have unworkable practical consequences for debt collecting lawyers.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondents 40\xe2\x80\x9341, 45\xe2\x80\x9348; NARCA Brief 4\xe2\x80\x9316; <em>post</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9314.  Carlisle claims the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s private enforcement provisions have fostered a \xe2\x80\x9ccottage industry\xe2\x80\x9d of professional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial violations of the Act.  See Brief for Respondents 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  If debt collecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their reasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the Act, Carlisle and its <em>amici</em> foresee a flood of lawsuits against creditors\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attorneys) seeking damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The threat of such liability, in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, creates an irreconcilable conflict between an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s personal financial interest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on behalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the FDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand, exposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving the legal ambiguity against her client\xe2\x80\x99s interest or advising the client to settle\xe2\x80\x94even where there is substantial legal authority for a position favoring the client.  <em>Post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9314.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not believe our holding today portends such grave consequences.  For one, the FDCPA contains several provisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits, thereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys.  When an alleged violation is trivial, the \xe2\x80\x9cactual damage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d sustained, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(1), will likely be <em>de minimis</em> or even zero.  The Act sets a cap on \xe2\x80\x9cadditional\xe2\x80\x9d damages, \xc2\xa71692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to adjust such damages where a violation is based on a good-faith error, \xc2\xa71692k(b).  One <em>amicus</em> suggests that attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees may shape financial incentives even where actual and statutory damages are modest.  NARCA Brief 11.  The statute does contemplate an award of costs and \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as determined by the court\xe2\x80\x9d in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cany successful action to enforce the foregoing liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3).  But courts have discretion in calculating reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under this statute,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the defendant if a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit \xe2\x80\x9cwas brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c).  Not every uncertainty presented in litigation stems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act itself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for instance, where a violation results from a qualifying factual error.  Jerman and the Government suggest that lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under \xc2\xa71692k(e).  Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not frequently issued such opinions, and that the average processing time may present practical difficulties.  Indeed, the Government informed us at oral argument that the FTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in response to seven requests), and the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s response time has typically been three or four months.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\xe2\x80\x9328, 30.  Without disregarding the possibility that the FTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some cases, evidence of present administrative practice makes us reluctant to place significant weight on \xc2\xa71692k(e) as a practical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise of Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.  We addressed a similar argument in <em>Heintz</em>, in which the petitioner urged that certain of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions would generate \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98anomalies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d if the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collector\xe2\x80\x9d was read to include litigating lawyers.  514 U. S., at 295.  Among other things, the petitioner in <em>Heintz</em> contended that \xc2\xa71692c(c)\xe2\x80\x99s bar on further communication with a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is refusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from filing a lawsuit to collect the debt.  <em>Id.,</em> at 296\xe2\x80\x93297.  We agreed it would be \xe2\x80\x9codd\xe2\x80\x9d if the Act interfered in this way with \xe2\x80\x9can ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit\xe2\x80\x9d but suggested \xc2\xa71692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several exceptions in the text of that provision itself.  <em>Ibid.</em>  As in <em>Heintz</em>, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act\xe2\x80\x99s conduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provisions should not be assumed to compel absurd results when applied to debt collecting attorneys.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique in our law.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ethical duty to advance the interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nix</em> v. <em>Whiteside</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/157/index.html">475 U. S. 157</a>, 168 (1986).  Lawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits presented \xe2\x80\x9cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11(b), (c).  Model rules of professional conduct adopted by many States impose outer bounds on an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of a client\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1 (2009) (requiring nonfrivolous basis in law and fact for claims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to third parties).  In some circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability for conduct undertaken during representation of a client.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html">511 U. S. 164</a>, 191 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny person or entity, including a lawyer, \xe2\x80\xa6 who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities and Exchange Commission Rule] 10b\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding FDCPA liability may not always be adverse to her client.  Some courts have held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 violations of the FDCPA.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Fox</em> v. <em>Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc.</em>, 15 F.\xc2\xa03d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also <em>First Interstate Bank of Fort Collins, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Soucie</em>, 924 P.\xc2\xa02d 1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The suggestion that our reading of \xc2\xa71692k(c) will create unworkable consequences is also undermined by the existence of numerous state consumer protection and debt collection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Several States have enacted debt collection statutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney debt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, \xc2\xa749 (West 2008); Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \xc2\xa714\xe2\x80\x93203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7646.641 (2007); Wis. Stat. \xc2\xa7427.105 (2007\xe2\x80\x932008).  More generally, a group of 21 States as <em>amici</em> supporting Jerman inform us they are aware of \xe2\x80\x9cno [judicial] decisions interpreting a parallel state bona fide error provision [in a civil regulatory statute] to immunize a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mistake of law,\xe2\x80\x9d except in a minority of statutes that expressly provide to the contrary.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  See Brief for State of New York et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11, and n.\xc2\xa06.  Neither Carlisle and its <em>amici</em> nor the dissent demonstrate that lawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these state regimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, these policy concerns are evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could not have intended\xe2\x80\x9d the reading we adopt today.  <em>Post</em>, at 5.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading raises concerns of its own.  The dissent focuses on the facts of this case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cacted reasonably at every step\xe2\x80\x9d and committed a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical violation\xe2\x80\x9d resulting in no \xe2\x80\x9cactual harm\xe2\x80\x9d to the debtor.  <em>Post,</em> at 12, 6, 8.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s legal theory does not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical\xe2\x80\x9d violations.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Under that approach, it appears, nonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.  Moreover, many debt collectors are compensated with a percentage of money recovered, and so will have a financial incentive to press the boundaries of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions on collection techniques.  It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collectors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of the law would be consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s broadly worded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct.  Jerman and her <em>amici</em> express further concern that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading would give a competitive advantage to debt collectors who press the boundaries of lawful conduct.  They foresee a \xe2\x80\x9crace to the bottom\xe2\x80\x9d driving ethical collectors out of business.  Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for Public Citizen et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  It is difficult to square such a result with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, [and] to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71692(e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading also invites litigation about a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and the adequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error.  Cf. <em>Barlow</em>, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the law will not excuse civil or criminal liability \xe2\x80\x9cresults from the extreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide, the interpretation of the party\xe2\x80\x9d).  Courts that read \xc2\xa71692k(c) to permit a mistake-of-law defense have adopted varying formulations of what legal procedures are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably adapted to avoid any [legal] error.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Among other uncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it would read \xc2\xa71692k(c) to impose a heightened standard for the procedures attorney debt collectors must maintain, as compared to nonattorney debt collectors.  The increased cost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty of outcome may chill private suits under the statutory right of action, undermining the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s calibrated scheme of statutory incentives to encourage self-enforcement.  Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The Challenge of Change 67 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the Commission receives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection complaints per year, it is not feasible for federal government law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary means of deterring all possible law violations\xe2\x80\x9d).  The state <em>amici </em>predict that, on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reading, consumers will have little incentive to bring enforcement actions \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such circumstances a debt collector could easily claim bona fide error of law\xe2\x80\x9d; in the States\xe2\x80\x99 view, the resulting \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement gap\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9cextensive\xe2\x80\x9d at both the federal and State levels.  See Brief for State of New York et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7\xe2\x80\x9310.  In short, the policy concerns identified by the dissent tell only half the story.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we do not foresee that our decision today will place unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the debt collection industry.  To the extent debt collecting lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the requirements of the FDCPA, Carlisle, its <em>amici</em>, and the dissent have not shown that \xe2\x80\x9cthe result [will be] so absurd as to warrant\xe2\x80\x9d disregarding the weight of textual authority discussed above.  <em>Heintz</em>, 514 U. S., at 295.  Absent such a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.  To the extent Congress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified by the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s liability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute accordingly.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to revise \xc2\xa71692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or grant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.  This Court may not, however, read more into \xc2\xa71692k(c) than the statutory language naturally supports.  We therefore hold that the bona fide error defense in \xc2\xa71692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect interpretation of the requirements of that statute.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an \xe2\x80\x9cinitial communication\xe2\x80\x9d about the collection of a debt, to send the consumer a written notice containing, <em>inter alia</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ca statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court distinguished, for instance, <em>Graziano</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, 950 F.\xc2\xa02d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s dispute of a debt under \xc2\xa71692g must be in writing to be effective.  Noting that district courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results, and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the court adopted the reasoning from <em>Camacho</em> v. <em>Bridgeport Financial, Inc.</em>, 430 F.\xc2\xa03d 1078, 1080\xe2\x80\x931082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain language of \xc2\xa71692g does not impose an \xe2\x80\x9cin writing\xe2\x80\x9d requirement on consumers.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Welmaker </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co.</em>, 365 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972).  But even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather than court of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the statutory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on those decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Turner</em> v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em>, 537 F.\xc2\xa02d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) <em>(per curiam)</em> (referring to \xc2\xa71640(c) as the \xe2\x80\x9cso-called clerical error defense\xe2\x80\x9d).  Carlisle also relies on the holding in <em>Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc.</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 274 So.\xc2\xa02d 150 (La. 1973).  But in that case, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded only that a lender\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken interpretation of <em>state</em> usury law did not \xe2\x80\x9camoun[t] to an intentional violation of [TILA\xe2\x80\x99s] disclosure requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 161.  The Louisiana court had no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we consider today: whether TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense extended to violations resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself.  See n. 4, <em>supra;</em> see also <em>Starks</em> v. <em>Orleans Motors, Inc.</em>, 372 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 928, 931 (ED La.)

Whether or not we would take that view when such an inference serves as a court\xe2\x80\x99s sole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on common principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.  Moreover, the inference is supported by the fact that TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary titles of the CCPA, a comprehensive consumer-protection statute.  While not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the legislative record demonstrates that some Members of Congress understood the relationship between the FDCPA and existing provisions of the CCPA.

No. 96\xe2\x80\x93368, p. 32 (1979)).</p>\n<p>\n\nThe concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency between these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references in the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n.\xc2\xa010, <em>supra</em>, and reading the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense to include factual mistakes.  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, and n.\xc2\xa02 (opinion of Scalia, J.); <em>post</em>, at 20 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  The quoted legislative history sources, however, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes <em>legal </em>errors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.  Similarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction between factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented with claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfactual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide.  See <em>Ives</em>, 522 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 756\xe2\x80\x93757; <em>Haynes</em>, 503 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1166\xe2\x80\x931167; <em>Palmer</em>, 502 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 861.  While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, constitute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71692k(c), we need not and do not decide today the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or what kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense.  Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection \xc2\xa77.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case law on scope of \xc2\xa71692k(c)).</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Government observes that several federal agencies have construed similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to exclude errors of law.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance, has promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72607(d)(3), does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n error of legal judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d 24 CFR \xc2\xa73500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009).  While administrative interpretations of other statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that no agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals.  Of course, nothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations or the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in other statutes to adopt a different reading.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U.

To similar effect, a House Report on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new legislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds that existing statutes \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently require[d]\xe2\x80\x9d a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cspecific intent[,] which is difficult to prove.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

In particular, a concern was raised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error defense had been interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cas only protecting against a mathematical error,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the FDCPA defense should \xe2\x80\x9cgo beyond\xe2\x80\x9d TILA to \xe2\x80\x9callow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a technical error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Markup 20.

As noted, in one of the statutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a mistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the \xe2\x80\x9chighly technical\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the scheme.

See Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9348; <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a> (1995).  Can those lawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face personal liability when they rely on good-faith interpretations of the Act that are later rejected by a court?  Or will that threat of personal liability lead them to do less than their best for those clients?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a way out of\xe2\x80\x94though not a panacea for\xe2\x80\x94this dilemma.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  Faced with legal uncertainty, a lawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) for an advisory opinion.  16 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71.1 to 1.4 (2009).  And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it the dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion, he has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable.  If he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any such liability.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(e) (debt collectors immune from liability for \xe2\x80\x9cany act done or omitted in \xe2\x80\xa6 conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal Trade] Commission\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also R. Hobbs et\xc2\xa0al., National Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76.12.2, 7.3 (6th ed. 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FTC, of course, may refuse to issue such an opinion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 16 CFR \xc2\xa71.1 (providing that the Commission will issue advisory opinions \xe2\x80\x9cwhere practicable\xe2\x80\x9d and only when \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he matter involves a substantial or novel question of fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court precedent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cis of significant public interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  Apparently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only seven requests and issued four opinions.  See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27\xe2\x80\x9328; see also Federal Trade Commis-\nsion,Commission FDCPA Advisory Opinions, online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpajump.shtm (as visited Apr. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Yet, should the dilemma I have described above prove serious, I would expect the FTC to receive more requests and to respond to them, thereby reducing the scope of the problem to the point where other available tools, <em>e.g.</em>, damages caps and vicarious liability, will prove adequate.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9327.  On this understanding, I agree with the Court and join its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963112">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF SCALIA, J.<br/>\nJERMAN V.

A portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning consists of this: The language in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) tracks language in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); and in the nine years between the enactment of TILA and the enactment of the FDCPA, three Courts of Appeals had \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreted TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Relying on our statement in <em>Bragdon</em> v. <em>Abbott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/624/index.html">524 U. S. 624</a>, 645 (1998), that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s repetition, in a new statute, of statutory language with a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98settled\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d judicial interpretation indicates \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the intent to incorporate its \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial interpretations as well,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concludes that these three Court of Appeals cases \xe2\x80\x9csuppor[t] an inference that Congress understood the statutory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what counts is what Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended,\xe2\x80\x9d even if that intent finds no expression in the enacted text.  When a large majority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time, have uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the meaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reasonable to assume that Congress was aware of those holdings, took them to be correct, and intended the same meaning in adopting that text.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  It seems to me unreasonable, however, to assume that, when Congress has a bill before it that contains language used in an earlier statute, it is aware of, and approves as correct, a mere three Court of Appeals decisions interpreting that earlier statute over the previous nine years.  Can one really believe that a majority in both Houses of Congress knew of those three cases, and accepted them as correct (even when, as was the case here, some District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court opinion had concluded, to the contrary, that the defense covered legal errors, see <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa010)?  This is a legal fiction, which has nothing to be said for it except that it can sometimes make our job easier.  The Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interpretations of three Federal Courts of Appeals may not have \xe2\x80\x98settled\xe2\x80\x99 the meaning of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense,\xe2\x80\x9d but says \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed with those interpretations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Perhaps not; but no reason to suppose that it knew of and agreed with them either\xe2\x80\x94which is presumably the proposition for which the Court cites them. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming, moreover, that Congress knew and approved of those cases, they would not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion today.  All three of them said that TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense covered only <em>clerical </em>errors<em>.</em>  See <em>Ives</em> v. <em>W. T. Grant Co.</em>, 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975) (\xe2\x80\x9conly available for clerical errors\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Haynes</em> v. <em>Logan Furniture Mart, Inc.</em>, 503 F.\xc2\xa02d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cbasically only clerical errors\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Palmer</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 502 F.\xc2\xa02d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]lerical errors . . . are the only violations this section was designed to excuse\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet the Court specifically interprets the identical language in the FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical errors, but also<em> </em>for <em>factual</em> errors.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19, 24; see also <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (suggesting the same).  If the Court really finds the three Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of TILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it should restrict its decision accordingly.  As for me, I support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of factual<em> </em>errors, because there is nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d violations to those based on clerical errors, and since there is a long tradition in the common law and in our construction of federal statutes distinguishing errors of fact from errors of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also makes fulsome use of that other legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a single Representative\xe2\x80\x99s floor remarks on the House bill that became the FDCPA, <em>ante</em>, at 16, n.\xc2\xa011, to a single Representative\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee hearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, <em>ibid.</em>, to two 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the FDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa012, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Senate bill on the FDCPA, <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, n.\xc2\xa014, to a House Report dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, <em>ibid.  </em>Is the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out such mini-nuggets of \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional intent\xe2\x80\x9d from floor remarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and committee reports covering many different bills over many years?  When the Court addresses such far-afield legislative history merely \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of completeness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful over-lawyering.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As it happens, moreover, one of the supposedly most \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritative\xe2\x80\x9d snippets of legislative history, a Senate Committee Report dealing with the meaning of TILA, states very clearly that the 1980 amendment to TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense \xe2\x80\x9cclarified\xe2\x80\x9d the defense \xe2\x80\x9cto make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x9373, pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938 (1979).  Likewise, the 1999 American Law Report the Court cites, <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa012, which relies on another Senate Committee Report, describes the amendment as clarifying the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing view\xe2\x80\x9d that the defense \xe2\x80\x9capplies to clerical errors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lockhart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211\xe2\x80\x93212, \xc2\xa72[a] (1999).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Once again, the legal fiction contradicts the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the language in the FDCPA, identical to the original TILA defense, applies to mistakes of fact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But if legislative history is to be used, it should be used impartially.  (Legislative history, after all, almost always has something for everyone!)  The Court dismisses with a wave of the hand what seems to me the most persuasive legislative history (if legislative history could ever be persuasive) in the case.  The respondents point to the Senate Committee Report on the FDCPA, which says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] debt collector has no liability . . . if he violates the act in any manner, <em>including with regard to the act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage</em>, when such violation is unintentional and occurred despite procedures designed to avoid such violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93382, p.\xc2\xa05 (1977) (emphasis added).  The Court claims that a mistake about \xe2\x80\x9cthe act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage\xe2\x80\x9d in this passage might refer to factual mistakes, such as a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken belief \xe2\x80\x9cthat a particular debt arose out of a nonconsumer transaction and was therefore not \xe2\x80\x98covered\xe2\x80\x99 by the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 21.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation seems to me inadequate.  No lawyer\xe2\x80\x94indeed, no one speaking accurately\xe2\x80\x94would equate a mistake regarding the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular fact situation falls within the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  What the Act covers (\xe2\x80\x9cthe act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage\xe2\x80\x9d) is one thing; whether a particular case falls <em>within </em>the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage is something else.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase <em>could </em>be used to refer to <em>both </em>these things, by what principle does the Court reject the more plausible meaning?  The fact that \xe2\x80\x9cattorneys were excluded from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98debt collector\xe2\x80\x99 until 1986,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, does not, as the Court contends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not covered.  Attorneys are not the only ones who would have been able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys make legal mistakes too.  They also sometimes receive and rely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys.  Indeed, if anyone could satisfy the defense\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of maintaining \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid\xe2\x80\x9d a legal error, it would be a non-attorney debt collector who fol-\nlows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his attorney.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also points to \xe2\x80\x9cequivocal\xe2\x80\x9d evidence from the Senate Committee\xe2\x80\x99s final markup session, <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, n.\xc2\xa014, but it minimizes a decidedly unhelpful discussion of the scope of the defense during the session.  In response to concern that the defense would be construed, like the TILA defense, as \xe2\x80\x9conly protecting against a mathematical error,\xe2\x80\x9d a staff member explained that, because of differences in the nature of the statutes, the FDCPA defense was broader than the TILA defense and \xe2\x80\x9cwould apply to <em>any</em> violation of the act which was unintentional.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup Session: S. 1130\xe2\x80\x94Debt Collection Legislation 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (July 26, 1977) (emphasis added).  The Chairman then asked: \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not simply a mathematical error but <em>any</em> bona fide error without intent?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 21 (emphasis added).  To which the staff member responded: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The repeated use of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cany violation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany bona fide error\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94supports the natural reading of the Committee Report\xe2\x80\x99s statement regarding \xe2\x80\x9cthe act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage\xe2\x80\x9d as including legal errors about the scope of the Act, rather than just factual errors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court ultimately dismisses the Senate Committee Report on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislative record taken as a whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  I think it more reasonable to give zero weight to the other snippets of legislative history that the Court relies upon, for the reason that the Senate Committee Report on the very bill that became the FDCPA flatly contradicts them.  It is almost invariably the case that our opinions benefit not at all from the make-weight use of legislative history.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion probably suffers from it.  Better to spare us the results of legislative-history research, however painfully and exhaustively conducted it might have been.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual analysis stands on its own, without need of (or indeed any assistance from) the two fictions I have discussed.  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course where so many federal courts have read the language that way, the text was probably clear enough that resort to unexpressed congressional intent would be unnecessary.  Or indeed it could be said that such uniform and longstanding judicial interpretation had established the public meaning of the text, whether the Members of Congress were aware of the cases or not.  That would be the understanding of the text by reasonable people familiar with its legal context.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The page cited in the Senate Committee Report does not actually support the American Law Report\xe2\x80\x99s statement.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692 <em>et seq.</em>  The statute excepts from liability a debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error[s],\xe2\x80\x9d provided that they were \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d and reasonable procedures have been maintained to avoid them.  \xc2\xa71692k(c).  The Court today interprets this exception to exclude legal errors.  In doing so, it adopts a questionable interpretation and rejects a straightforward, quite reasonable interpretation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms.  Its decision aligns the judicial system with those who would use litigation to enrich themselves at the expense of attorneys who strictly follow and adhere to professional and ethical standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the law is used to punish good-faith mistakes; when adopting reasonable safeguards is not enough to avoid liability; when the costs of discovery and litigation are used to force settlement even absent fault or injury; when class-action suits transform technical legal violations into windfalls for plaintiffs or their attorneys, the Court, by failing to adopt a reasonable interpretation to counter these excesses, risks compromising its own institutional responsibility to ensure a workable and just litigation system.  The interpretation of the FDCPA the Court today endorses will entrench, not eliminate, some of the most troubling aspects of our legal system.

An exception\nto liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error defense:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA debt collector may not be held liable in any action \xe2\x80\xa6 if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation<em> </em>was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71692k(c).</p>\n<p align="left">This language does not exclude mistakes of law and is most naturally read to include them.  Certainly a mistaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error\xe2\x80\x9d as that phrase is normally understood.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca belief that what is false is true or that what is true is false,\xe2\x80\x9d def. 1); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[a] mistake of law or of fact in a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, opinion, or order,\xe2\x80\x9d def. 2); <em>ibid.</em> (listing categories of legal errors).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The choice of words provides further reinforcement for this view.  The bona fide error exception in \xc2\xa71692k(c) applies if \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The term \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d specifically denotes a legal infraction.  See <em>id.,</em> at 1600 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn infraction or breach of the law; a transgression,\xe2\x80\x9d def. 1).  The statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d thus stands in direct contrast to other provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself.  This applies both to specific terms, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71692e (\xe2\x80\x9cA debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt\xe2\x80\x9d), and to more general ones, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71692k(e) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cany act done or omitted in good faith\xe2\x80\x9d).  By linking the <em>mens rea</em> requirement (\xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional\xe2\x80\x9d) with the word \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than with the conduct giving rise to the violation\xe2\x80\x94the Act by its terms indicates that the bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well as to factual ones.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents accord with this interpretation.  Federal statutes that link the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d with a <em>mens rea</em> requirement have been interpreted to excuse good-faith legal mistakes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McLaughlin</em> v. <em>Richland Shoe Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/128/index.html">486 U. S. 128</a>, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising out of a willful violation\xe2\x80\x9d in the Fair Labor Standards Act applies where an employer \xe2\x80\x9ceither knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thurston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/111/index.html">469 U. S. 111</a>, 125, 126 (1985) (damages provision under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which applies \xe2\x80\x9conly in cases of willful violations,\xe2\x80\x9d creates liability where an employer \xe2\x80\x9cknew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Liparota</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/419/index.html">471 U.

The FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d thus distinguishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the Court to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are disfavored.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (citing <em>Kolstad</em> v. <em>American Dental Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/526/index.html">527 U. S. 526</a> (1999)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s response is that there is something distinctive about the word \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d that suggests an excuse for mistakes of law.  This may well be true for criminal statutes, in which the terms \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowing,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98intentional\xe2\x80\x99 [and] \xe2\x80\x98willful\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d have been distinguished in this regard.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (citing <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/47/index.html">551 U. S. 47</a>, 57 (2007)).  But this distinction is specific to the criminal context:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is different in the criminal law.  When the term \xe2\x80\x98willful\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98willfully\xe2\x80\x99 has been used in a criminal statute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting liability to knowing violations.  This reading of the term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where it is characteristically used to require a criminal intent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt, or an additional \xe2\x80\x98bad purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 or specific intent to violate a known legal duty created by highly technical statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 57\xe2\x80\x9358, n.\xc2\xa09 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFor this reason, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s citation to criminal cases, which are themselves inconsistent, see <em>Ratzlaf</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/135/index.html">510 U. S. 135</a> (1994), is unavailing.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the civil context, by contrast, the word \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d has been used to impose a <em>mens rea</em> threshold for liability that is lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.  See <em>Safeco,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 57 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well\xe2\x80\x9d).  Avoiding liability under a statute aimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier, not harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed at willful violations.  And certainly there is nothing in <em>Thurston</em> or <em>McLaughlin</em>\xe2\x80\x94both civil cases\xe2\x80\x94suggesting that they would have come out differently had the relevant statutes used \xe2\x80\x9cintentional violation\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cwillful violation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations suffice to show that \xc2\xa71692k(c) is most reasonably read to include mistakes of law.  Even if this were merely a permissible reading, however, it should be adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must flow from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading leads to results Congress could not have intended.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Congress has enacted to protect consumers.  A number of these statutes authorize the filing of private suits against those who use unfair or improper practices.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k (FDCPA); \xc2\xa71640 (Truth in Lending Act); \xc2\xa71681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa732710 (Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7526(c)(2) (Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005).  Several of these provisions permit a successful plaintiff to recover\xe2\x80\x94in addition to actual damages\xe2\x80\x94statutory damages, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, and in some cases punitive damages.  <em>E.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a)(2) (statutory damages); \xc2\xa71640(a)(3) (attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs); \xc2\xa71681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages); \xc2\xa71681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees); 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa732710(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c3 times the actual damages or $1,500, whichever is greater\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa732710(b) (costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees); 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees).  Some also explicitly permit class-action suits.  <em>E.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(B); \xc2\xa71692k(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create incentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has occurred.  This happens when the plaintiff can recover statutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney will receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how slight the injury.  A favorable verdict after trial is not necessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as happy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who will receive fees regardless).  The defendant, meanwhile, may conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs of discovery and a protracted trial.  And if the suit attains class-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to \xe2\x80\x9cthe lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the [defendant]\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71692k(a)(2)(B) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present case offers an object lesson.  Respondents filed a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that mistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it.  Jerman\xe2\x80\x99s attorney then informed respondents that the debt had been paid in full.  Respondents confirmed this fact with the client and withdrew the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This might have been the end of the story.  But because respondents had informed Jerman that she was required to dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action complaint.  It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no harm as a result of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  Jerman sued for damages, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and costs\xe2\x80\x94including class damages of \xe2\x80\x9c$500,000 or 1% of defendants\xe2\x80\x99 net worth whichever is less.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amended Complaint in No. 1:06\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9301397 (ND Ohio), p. 4.  In addition to merits-related discovery, Jerman sought information from respondents concerning the income and net worth of each partner in the firm.  At some point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents for $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Amended Joint App. in No. 07\xe2\x80\x933964 (CA6), pp. 256\xe2\x80\x93262.  The case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex federal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incentives to settle simply to avoid attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding gives new impetus to this already troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the attorneys who conceive of the suit.  See <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</em> v. <em>Lamar</em>, 503 F.\xc2\xa03d 504, 513 (CA6 2007) (referring to the \xe2\x80\x9ccottage industry\xe2\x80\x9d of litigation that has arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks omitted)).  It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by this dynamic.  That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide error defense.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, however, endorses and drives forward this dynamic, for today\xe2\x80\x99s holding leaves attorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for adopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be mistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid mistakes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting that trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of actual damages and that trial courts \xe2\x80\x9chave discretion in calculating reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under [the] statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  It is not clear, however, that a court is permitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of the suit\xe2\x80\x99s utility.  Cf. <em>Perdue</em> v. <em>Kenny A.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 9 (noting a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strong presumption\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of reasonableness that attaches to a lodestar calculation of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees).  Though the Court, properly, does not address the question here, it acknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to victorious plaintiffs to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mandatory,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d even if the plaintiff suffered no damage.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, n.\xc2\xa016.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s second response is that the FDCPA guards against abusive suits and that suits brought \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d can lead to a fee award for the defendant.  <em>Ante,</em> at 24 (quoting \xc2\xa71692k(a)(3)).  Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits based on technical\xe2\x80\x94but harmless\xe2\x80\x94violations of the statute.  If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a settlement, then by definition the suit will not have been brought in bad faith.  See <em>Emanuel</em> v. <em>American Credit Exch.</em>, 870 F.\xc2\xa02d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim for malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the action subject of the claim is unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again the present case is instructive.  Jerman brought suit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  At the time her complaint was filed, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether a debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in writing, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached different answers.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  The trial court in this case happened to side with Jerman on the issue, 464 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 720, 722\xe2\x80\x93725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems unlikely that the court would have labeled her suit \xe2\x80\x9cabusive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin bad faith\xe2\x80\x9d even if it had gone the other way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one contemplates the practical consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16 CFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPA regulations), technical violations are likely to be common.  Indeed, the Court acknowledges that they are inevitable.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  As long as legal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will have an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It seems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system that encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over harmless violations committed in good faith despite reasonable safeguards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When construing a federal statute, courts should be mindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional purposes explicit in the statutory text.  The FDCPA states an objective that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision frustrates.  The statutory purpose was to \xe2\x80\x9celiminate abusive debt collection practices\xe2\x80\x9d and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain from using those practices \xe2\x80\x9care not competitively disadvantaged.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692(e) (\xe2\x80\x9cPurposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  The practices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is deliberate, see \xc2\xa71692(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cabusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71692(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cmisrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices\xe2\x80\x9d), or unreasonable, see \xc2\xa71692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from communicating with debtors at times \xe2\x80\x9cwhich should be known\xe2\x80\x9d to be inconvenient); \xc2\xa71692e(8) (prohibiting the communication of credit card information \xe2\x80\x9cwhich should be known to be false\xe2\x80\x9d).  That explains the statutory objective not to disadvantage debt collectors who \xe2\x80\x9crefrain\xe2\x80\x9d from abusive practices\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, debt collectors who do not intentionally or unreasonably adopt them.  It further explains why Congress included a good-faith error exception,\nwhich exempts violations that are not intentional or\nunreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In referring to \xe2\x80\x9cabusive debt collection practices,\xe2\x80\x9d however, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who act based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal interpretations.  A debt collector does not gain a competitive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more than by making good-faith factual errors.  This is expressly so if the debt collector has implemented \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid\xe2\x80\x9d them.  By reading \xc2\xa71692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court fails to align its interpretation with the statutory\nobjectives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy concerns on the other side.  The Court frets about debt collectors who \xe2\x80\x9cpress the boundaries of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions\xe2\x80\x9d and about a potential \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98race to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32).  For instance, in its view, interpreting \xc2\xa71692k(c) to encompass legal mistakes might mean that \xe2\x80\x9cnonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  It must be remembered, however, that \xc2\xa71692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector\xe2\x80\x99s error is \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide\xe2\x80\x9d and where \xe2\x80\x9creasonable procedures\xe2\x80\x9d have been adopted to avoid errors.  There is no valid or persuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to impose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith on the reasonable advice of counsel.  If anything, we should expect Congress to think that such behavior should be encouraged, not discouraged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also suggests that reading \xc2\xa71692k(c) to include legal errors would encourage litigation over a number of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liability; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes; what standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney debt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collectors.  Yet these questions are no different from ones already raised by the statute.  Whether the debt collector is an attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be assessed before liability can be determined.  Procedures to avoid mistakes\xe2\x80\x94whether legal or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94must be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d which is always a context-specific inquiry.  The Court provides no reason to think that legal errors raise concerns that differ in these respects from those raised by non-legal errors. </p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a further and most serious reason to interpret \xc2\xa71692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Heintz</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a> (1995), the Court held that attorneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collectors\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the FDCPA.  In reaching this conclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its interpretation would produce the anomalous result that attorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against debtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.  <em>Id.,</em> at 295.  The Court rejected this argument.  In doing so it said that \xc2\xa71692k(c) provides debt collectors with a defense for their bona fide errors.  <em>Id.,</em> at 295<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court relies on Heintz</em> to allay concerns about the practical implications of its decision.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25.  Yet the Court reads \xc2\xa71692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law, thereby producing the very result that <em>Heintz</em> said would not come about. Attorneys may now be held liable for taking reasonable legal positions in good faith if those positions are ultimately rejected.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attorneys are duty-bound to represent their clients with diligence, creativity, and painstaking care, all within the confines of the law.  When statutory provisions have not yet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advocacy is to be prized, not punished.  Surely this includes offering interpretations of a statute that are permissible, even if not yet settled.  The FDCPA is a complex statute, and its provisions are subject to different interpretations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 5, n.\xc2\xa04 (identifying splits of authority on two different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5\xe2\x80\x936 (identifying another split); see also <em>ante</em>, at 12.  Attorneys will often find themselves confronted with a statutory provision that is susceptible to different but still reasonable interpretations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An attorney\xe2\x80\x99s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to give the client his or her best professional assessment of the law\xe2\x80\x99s mandate.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney vulnerable to suit.  For if the attorney proceeds based on an interpretation later rejected by the courts, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision deems that to be actionable as an intentional \xe2\x80\x9cviolation,\xe2\x80\x9d with personal financial liability soon to follow.  Indeed, even where a particular practice is compelled by existing precedent, the attorney may be sued if that precedent is later overturned.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These adverse consequences are evident in the instant case.  When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint against Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no reason to doubt that the debt was valid.  They had every reason, furthermore, to believe that they were on solid legal ground in asking her to dispute the amount owed in writing.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Graziano</em> v. <em>Harrison</em>, 950 F.\xc2\xa02d 107, 112 (CA3 1991) (written objection is necessary for coherent statutory scheme and protects the debtor by \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[ing] a lasting record of the fact that the debt has been disputed\xe2\x80\x9d).  When Jerman disputed the debt, respondents verified that the debt had been satisfied and withdrew the lawsuit.  Respondents acted reasonably at every step, and yet may still find themselves liable for a harmless violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, attorneys can be punished for advocacy reasonably deemed to be in compliance with the law or even required by it.  This distorts the legal process.  Henceforth, creditors\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys of the highest ethical standing are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly interpretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves incur personal financial risk.  It is most disturbing that this Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will interject an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s personal financial interests into the professional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client relationship.  These consequences demonstrate how untenable the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory interpretation is and counsel in favor of a different reading.  See <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa05 (2010) (slip op., at 16, n.\xc2\xa05) (rejecting a reading of federal law that \xe2\x80\x9cwould seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s response is that this possibility is nothing new, because attorneys are already duty-bound to comply with the law and with standards of professional conduct.  Attorneys face sanctions for harassing behavior and frivolous litigation, and in some cases misconduct may give rise to personal liability.  <em>Ante, </em>at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This response only underscores the problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  By reading \xc2\xa71692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law, the Court ensures that attorneys will face liability even when they have done nothing wrong\xe2\x80\x94indeed, even when they have acted in accordance with their professional responsibilities.  Here respondents\xe2\x80\x99 law firm did not harass Jerman; it did not file a frivolous suit against her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused her no damages or injury.  The firm acted upon a reasonable legal interpretation that the District Court later thought to be mistaken.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s position, as all concede, was in conflict with other published, reasoned opinions.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4, n.\xc2\xa02.  (And in the instant case, neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the issue.  See <em>ante,</em> at 5, n.\xc2\xa03.)  If the law firm can be punished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe an attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly interpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow if some later decision adopts a different rule.  This dynamic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney-client relationship but also for First Amendment rights.  Cf. <em>Legal Services Corporation</em> v. <em>Velazquez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/533/index.html">531 U. S. 533</a>, 545 (2001) (law restricting arguments available to attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d).  We need not decide that these concerns rise to the level of an independent constitutional violation, see <em>ante</em>, at 29, n.\xc2\xa021, to recognize that they counsel against a problematic interpretation of the statute.  See <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x94although not the Court\xe2\x80\x94argues that an attorney faced with legal uncertainty only needs to turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for an advisory opinion.  An attorney\xe2\x80\x99s actions in conformity with the opinion will be shielded from liability.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion) (citing 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692k(e)).  This argument misconceives the practical realities of litigation.  Filings and motions are made under pressing time constraints; arguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic decisions must be taken in the face of incomplete information.  Lawyers in practice would not consider this alternative at all realistic, particularly where the defense is needed most.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And even were there time to generate a formal request to the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for a response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argument assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious, not latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that a conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be made.  But the problem in many instances is that interpretive alternatives are not at once apparent.  All this may explain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only four opinions in response to just seven requests.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\xe2\x80\x9328, 30.  The FTC advisory process does not remedy the difficulties that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethical dilemma of counsel is not resolved.  If the FTC adopts a position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still believe the FTC is mistaken.  Yet under today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the attorney who in good faith continues to assert a reasonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal liability.  This alters the ethical balance central to the adversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court to adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to avoid systemic disruption.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not assert that its interpretation is clearly commanded by the text.  Instead, its decision relies on an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are said to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.  This does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court relies on the maxim that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Barlow</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833)).  There is no doubt that this principle \xe2\x80\x9cis deeply rooted in the American legal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cheek</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/192/index.html">498 U. S. 192</a>, 199 (1991).  Yet it is unhelpful to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The maxim the Court cites is based on the premise \xe2\x80\x9cthat the law is definite and knowable,\xe2\x80\x9d so that all must be deemed to know its mandate.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know and obey\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, citizens cannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demonstrating a failure to learn it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most straightforward application of this principle is to statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohibited conduct.  These statutes will not be read to excuse legal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature meant to do so.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Armour Packing Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/56/index.html">209 U. S. 56</a>, 70, 85\xe2\x80\x9386 (1908) (rejecting the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a criminal statute forbidding shippers to \xe2\x80\x9cobtain or dispose of property at less than the regular rate established\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability for \xe2\x80\x9cintentional discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, however, the Court is not asked whether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from a general prohibition that would otherwise cover their conduct.  Rather, the issue is the scope of an express exception to a general prohibition.  There is good reason to think the distinction matters.  It is one thing to presume that Congress does not intend to create an exception to a general rule through silence; it is quite another to presume that an explicit statutory exception should be confined despite the existence of other sensible interpretations.  Cf. <em>Kosak</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/848/index.html">465 U. S. 848</a>, 853, n.\xc2\xa09 (1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper objective of a court attempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception\xe2\x80\x94no less and no more\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This is all the more true where the other possible interpretations are more consistent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme.  By its terms, \xc2\xa71692k(c) encompasses\xe2\x80\x94without limitation\xe2\x80\x94all violations that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot intentional and resul[t] from a bona fide error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court provides no reason to read this language narrowly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court responds that \xe2\x80\x9cour precedents have made clear for more than 175 years\xe2\x80\x9d that the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit statutory exceptions.  <em>Ante</em>, 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa05.  By this the Court means that one case applied the presumption to an exception more than 175 years ago.  In <em>Barlow</em>, the Court declined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statutory provision that excepted \xe2\x80\x9cfalse denomination[s] \xe2\x80\xa6 [that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to defraud the revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Pet., at 406.  In construing this language, the <em>Barlow</em> Court noted that it demonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of law:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe very association of mistake and accident, in this [connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume that the legislature had the same classes of cases in view \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Mistakes in the construction of the law, seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso, as accidents in the construction of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 411\xe2\x80\x93412. </p>\n<p align="left">\nUnlike the provision at issue in <em>Barlow</em>, \xc2\xa71692k(c) gives no indication that its broad reference to \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide error[s]\xe2\x80\x9d was meant to exclude legal mistakes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if statutory exceptions should normally be construed to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guideline would only apply absent intent to depart from the general rule.  There is no doubt that Congress may create a mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has done so here.  See <em>Ratzlaf</em>, 510 U. S. at 149.  As explained above, see Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>, Congress has made its choice plain by using the word \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71692k(c) to indicate that mistakes of law are to be included.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between \xc2\xa71692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa741 <em>et seq</em>.  Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that [an] act is\xe2\x80\x9d prohibited under the FDCPA.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16 CFR \xc2\xa71.98(d) (2009)).  The Court reasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide relatively harsh penalties for intentional violations.  By contrast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA itself must cover\xe2\x80\x94and hence \xc2\xa71692k(c) must not excuse\xe2\x80\x94unintentional violations.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument rests on a mistaken premise\xe2\x80\x94namely, that \xc2\xa71692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.  This misreads the statute.  As the text states, it applies only to \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide\xe2\x80\x9d errors committed despite \xe2\x80\x9cthe maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid\xe2\x80\x9d these mistakes.  So under a sensible reading of the statute, (1)\xc2\xa0intentional violations are punishable under the heightened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations are generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA; and (3)\xc2\xa0a defendant may escape liability altogether by proving that a violation was based on a bona fide error and that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in place.  There is nothing incongruous in this scheme.  Indeed, for the reasons described in Part I, <em>supra</em>, it is far less peculiar than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, which would subject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy, even advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then-existing case law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, in construing \xc2\xa71692k(c) to exclude legal errors, the Court points to the requirement that a debt collector maintain \xe2\x80\x9cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court asserts that this phrase most naturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual mistakes.  There is nothing natural in reading this phrase contrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish between different categories of mistakes.  Nor is there anything unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal mistakes.  The present case is again instructive.  According to the District Court, respondents designated a lead FDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended conferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodicals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys; trained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and held regular firm-wide meetings on FDCPA issues.  See 538 F.\xc2\xa03d 469, 477 (CA6 2008).  These procedures are not only \xe2\x80\x9creasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],\xe2\x80\x9d but also accord with the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contemplates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type of errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite way.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976)).  As made clear by the steps that respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compliance, this is simply not true.  The Court also speculates that procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be easier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors.  Even if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do with what the statute requires.  The statute does not talk about procedures that eliminate all\xe2\x80\x94or even most\xe2\x80\x94errors.  It merely requires procedures \xe2\x80\x9creasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute adopts the sensible approach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is to be avoided.  This approach, not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court argues that construing \xc2\xa71692k(c) to encompass a mistake-of-law defense \xe2\x80\x9cis at odds with\xe2\x80\x9d the role contemplated for the FTC.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  This is so, it contends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory opinions, and the statute shields from liability \xe2\x80\x9cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity\xe2\x80\x9d with such opinions.  \xc2\xa71692k(e).  But why, asks the Court, would a debt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity under \xc2\xa71692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in good faith on advice from private counsel?  Going further, the Court suggests that debt collectors might \xe2\x80\x9chave an affirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the law, which would then prevent them from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is little substance to this line of reasoning.  As the Court itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an incentive to invoke the FTC safe harbor even if \xc2\xa71692k(c) is construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because the safe harbor provides a \xe2\x80\x9cmore categorical immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa08.  Additionally, if a debt collector avoids seeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern that the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at odds with saying that his or her ignorance is \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should be noted further that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern about encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to \xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A).  That provision subjects a debt collector to harsh penalties for violating an FTC rule \xe2\x80\x9cwith actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive and is prohibited by such rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  No one contends that this will encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s rules.  Yet there is no doubt that \xc2\xa745(m)(1)(A) permits a mistake-of-law defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advisory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility.  For the reasons stated above, see Part I\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, <em>supra</em>, this is to be doubted.  Even the Court recognizes the limited role that the FTC has played.  <em>Ante</em>, at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]vidence of present administrative practice makes us reluctant to place significant weight on \xc2\xa71692k(e) as a practical remedy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the Court asserts that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny remaining doubt\xe2\x80\x9d about its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory history.  The Court points to the fact that \xc2\xa71692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision in the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), arguing that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA the view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense applied only to clerical errors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  As Justice Scalia points out, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claims of judicial uniformity are overstated.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  They rest on three Court of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by several District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court opinion\xe2\x80\x94hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which to divine legislative intent.  The Court also ignores the fact that those three Courts of Appeals had construed the TILA provision to apply only to clerical errors.  See <em>Ives</em> v. <em>W.\xc2\xa0T. Grant Co.</em>, 522 F.\xc2\xa02d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); <em>Haynes</em> v. <em>Logan Furniture Mart, Inc.</em>, 503 F.\xc2\xa02d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974); <em>Palmer</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 502 F.\xc2\xa02d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).  The Court therefore cannot explain why it reads \xc2\xa71692k(c) more broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress amended the TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error exception explicitly to exclude \xe2\x80\x9can error of legal judgment with respect to a person\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under [the TILA].\xe2\x80\x9d  See Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, \xc2\xa7615 (c), 94 Stat. 181.  This amendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had understood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.  The natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA language\xe2\x80\x94the same language later incorporated nearly verbatim into \xc2\xa71692k(c)\xe2\x80\x94was understood to cover those errors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s responses to this point are perplexing.  The Court first says that the 1980 amendment did not \xe2\x80\x9cobvious[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d change the scope of the TILA\xe2\x80\x99s bona fide error defense, given the \xe2\x80\x9cuniform interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d that the defense had been given in the Courts of Appeals.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory amendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious assumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court of Appeals consensus.  Cf. <em>Corley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; second alteration in original)).  (Without any evidence, the Court speculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to codify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal errors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  If those judicial interpretation were truly as uniform as the Court suggests\xe2\x80\x94and\n the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as ironclad\xe2\x80\x94there would have been no need for such a\nrecodification.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amendment weight because Congress \xe2\x80\x9chas not expressly <em>included</em> mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \xc2\xa71692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (emphasis in original).  In other words, the Court refuses to read \xc2\xa71692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide error statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes.  But the reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provisions included mistake-of-law language but \xc2\xa71692k(c) did not, we might think that the omission in \xc2\xa71692k(c) signaled Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent to exclude mistakes of law.  The absence of mistake-of-law language in \xc2\xa71692k(c) is consequently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit such language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error defenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA, expressly exclude legal errors from their scope.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (citing 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74010(c)(2)).  Yet this also can prove the opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide error defense were generally assumed not to include legal mistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to expressly exclude them.  It is only if the defense would otherwise include such errors that exclusionary language becomes necessary.  By writing explicit exclusionary language into the TILA (and some other federal provisions), Congress has indicated that those provisions would otherwise cover good-faith legal errors.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, \xc2\xa71692k(c) is best read to encompass mistakes of law.
