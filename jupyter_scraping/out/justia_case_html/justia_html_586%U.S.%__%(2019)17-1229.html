While Helsinn was developing its palonosetron product, it entered  into two agreements with another company granting that company the right to distribute, promote, market, and sell a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron in the United States.  The agreements required that the company keep confidential any proprietary information received  under the agreements.  Nearly two years later, in January 2003, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application covering a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron.  Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 2003 date.  Relevant here, Helsinn filed its fourth patent application in 2013.  That patent (the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent) covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution and is covered by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2011, respondents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively Teva), sought approval to market a generic 0.25 mg palonosetron product.  Helsinn sued Teva for infringing its patents, including the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent.  Teva countered that the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent was invalid under the \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d provision of the AIA\xe2\x80\x94which precludes a person from obtaining a patent on an invention that was \xe2\x80\x9cin public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94because the 0.25 mg dose was \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d more than one year before Helsinn filed the provisional patent application in 2003.  The District Court held that the AIA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d provision did not apply because the public disclosure of the agreements did not disclose the 0.25 mg dose.  The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the sale was publicly disclosed, regardless of whether the details of the invention were publicly disclosed in the terms of the sale agreements.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A commercial sale to a third party who is required to keep the invention confidential may place the invention \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7102(a).  The patent statute in force immediately before the AIA included an on-sale bar.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent interpreting that provision supports the view that a sale or offer of sale need not make an invention available to the public to constitute invalidating prior art.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pfaff</i> v. <i>Wells Electronics, Inc.</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/525/55/">525 U.S. 55</a>, 67.

Given this settled pre-AIA precedent, the Court applies the presumption that when Congress reenacted the same \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d language in the AIA, it adopted the earlier judicial construction of that phrase.  The addition of the catchall phrase \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise available to the public\xe2\x80\x9d is not enough of a change for the Court to conclude that Congress intended to alter the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9con sale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Paroline</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n572 U.S. 434, and <i>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Seatrain Lines, Inc.</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/411/726/">411 U.S. 726</a>, distinguished.

This case requires us to decide whether the sale of an invention to a third party who is contractually obligated to keep the invention confidential places the invention \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7102(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More than 20 years ago, this Court determined that an invention was \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of an earlier version of \xc2\xa7102(a) when it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe subject of a commercial offer for sale\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cready for patenting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pfaff</i> v. <i>Wells Electronics</i>,<i> Inc</i>.,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/525/55/">525 U.S. 55</a>, 67 (1998).  We did not further require that the sale make the details of the invention available to the public.  In light of this earlier construction, we determine that the reenactment of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d in the AIA did not alter this meaning.  Accordingly, a commercial sale to a third party who is required to keep the invention confidential may place the invention \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d under the AIA.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner Helsinn Healthcare S.\xc2\xa0A. (Helsinn) is a Swiss pharmaceutical company that makes Aloxi, a drug that treats chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Helsinn acquired the right to develop palonosetron, the active ingredient in Aloxi, in 1998.  In early 2000, it submitted protocols for Phase III clinical trials to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), proposing to study a 0.25 mg and a 0.75 mg dose of palonosetron.  In September 2000, Helsinn announced that it was beginning Phase III clinical trials and was seeking marketing partners for its palonosetron product.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Helsinn found its marketing partner in MGI Pharma, Inc. (MGI), a Minnesota pharmaceutical company that markets and distributes drugs in the United States.  Helsinn and MGI entered into two agreements: a license agreement and a supply and purchase agreement.  The license agreement granted MGI the right to distribute, promote, market, and sell the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron in the United States.  In return, MGI agreed to make upfront payments to Helsinn and to pay future royalties on distribution of those doses.  Under the supply and purchase agreement, MGI agreed to purchase exclusively from Helsinn any palonosetron product approved by the FDA.  Helsinn in turn agreed to supply MGI however much of the approved doses it required.  Both agreements included dosage information and required MGI to keep confidential any proprietary information received under the agreements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Helsinn and MGI announced the agreements in a joint press release, and MGI also reported the agreements in its Form 8\xe2\x80\x93K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the 8\xe2\x80\x93K filing included redacted copies of the agreements, neither the 8\xe2\x80\x93K filing nor the press releases disclosed the specific dosage formulations covered by the agreements.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On January 30, 2003, nearly two years after Helsinn and MGI entered into the agreements, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application covering the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron.  Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 30, 2003, date of the provisional application.  Helsinn filed its fourth patent application\xe2\x80\x94the one relevant here\xe2\x80\x94in May 2013, and it issued as U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent No. 8,598,219 (\xe2\x80\x99219 patent).  The \xe2\x80\x99219 patent covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution.  By virtue of its effective date, the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent is governed by the AIA.

In defense, Teva asserted that the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent was invalid because the 0.25 mg dose was \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d more than one year before Helsinn filed the provisional patent application covering that dose in January 2003.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The AIA precludes a person from obtaining a patent on an invention that was \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d before the effective filing date of the patent application:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cA person shall be entitled to a patent unless .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, <i>on sale</i>, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">See also \xc2\xa7102(b)(1) (exception for certain disclosures made within a year before the effective filing date).

The addition of \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise available to the public\xe2\x80\x9d is simply not enough of a change for us to conclude that Congress intended to alter the meaning of the reenacted term \xe2\x80\x9con sale.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <i>Holder</i> v. <i>Martinez Gutierrez</i>,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/566/583/">566 U.S. 583</a>, 593 (2012) (determining that a reenacted provision did not ratify an earlier judicial construction where the provision omitted the word on which the prior judicial constructions were based).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Helsinn disagrees, arguing that our construction reads \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d out of the statute.  Citing <i>Paroline</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n572 U.S. 434 (2014), and <i>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Seatrain Lines</i>,<i> Inc</i>.,\n\n<a class="related-case" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/411/726/">411 U.S. 726</a> (1973), Helsinn contends that the associated-words canon requires us to read \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise available to the public\xe2\x80\x9d to limit the preceding terms in \xc2\xa7102 to disclosures that make the claimed invention available to the public.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As an initial matter, neither of the cited decisions addresses the reenactment of terms that had acquired a well-settled judicial interpretation.  And Helsinn\xe2\x80\x99s argument places too much weight on \xc2\xa7102\xe2\x80\x99s catchall phrase.  Like other such phrases, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise available to the public\xe2\x80\x9d captures material that does not fit neatly into the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated categories but is nevertheless meant to be covered.  Given that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d had acquired a well-settled meaning when the AIA was enacted, we decline to read the addition of a broad catchall phrase to upset that body of precedent.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Helsinn does not ask us to revisit our pre-AIA interpretation of the on-sale bar.  Nor does it dispute the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the invention claimed in the \xe2\x80\x99219 patent was \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the pre-AIA statute.  Because we determine that Congress did not alter the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d when it enacted the AIA, we hold that an inventor\xe2\x80\x99s sale of an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential can qualify as prior art under \xc2\xa7102(a).  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered<i>.</i></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
