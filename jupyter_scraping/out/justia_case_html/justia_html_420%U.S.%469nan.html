The trial court, rejecting appellants\' claims that the broadcast was privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, held that the Georgia statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation and granted summary judgment for appellee.  On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court initially held that, while the trial court erred in construing the Georgia statute to extend a cause of action for invasion of privacy, the complaint stated a cause of action for common law invasion of privacy, and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not, as a matter of law, require judgment for appellants.  On a motion for rehearing, appellants contended that a rape victim\'s name was a matter of public interest, and hence could be published with impunity, but the Supreme Court denied the motion on the ground that the statute declared a state policy that a rape victim\'s name was not a matter of public concern, and sustained the statute as a legitimate limitation on the First Amendment\'s freedom of expression.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The issue before us in this case is whether, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a State may extend a cause of action for damages for invasion of privacy caused by the publication of the name of a deceased rape victim which was publicly revealed in connection with the prosecution of the crime.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In August, 1971, appellee\'s 17-year-old daughter was the victim of a rape, and did not survive the incident.  Six youths were soon indicted for murder and rape.  Although there was substantial press coverage of the crime and of subsequent developments, the identity of the victim was not disclosed pending trial, perhaps because of Ga.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 26-9901 (1972), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] which makes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 420 U. S. 472</a></p><p> it a misdemeanor to publish or broadcast the name or identity of a rape victim.  In April, 1972, some eight months later, the six defendants appeared in court.  Five pleaded guilty to rape or attempted rape, the charge of murder having been dropped.  The guilty pleas were accepted by the court, and the trial of the defendant pleading not guilty was set for a later date.</p>\n<p>In the course of the proceedings that day, appellant Wassell, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] a reporter covering the incident for his employer, learned the name of the victim from an examination of the indictments which were made available for his inspection in the courtroom. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  That the name of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 420 U. S. 473</a></p><p> victim appears in the indictments, and that the indictments were public records available for inspection are not disputed. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Later that day, Wassell broadcast over the facilities of station WSB-TV, a television station owned by appellant Cox Broadcasting Corp., a news report concerning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 420 U. S. 474</a></p><p> the court proceedings.  The report named the victim of the crime and was repeated the following day. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>In May, 1972, appellee brought an action for money damages against appellants, relying on \xc2\xa7 26-9901 and claiming that his right to privacy had been invaded by the television broadcasts giving the name of his deceased daughter.  Appellants admitted the broadcasts, but claimed that they were privileged under both state law and the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court, rejecting appellants\' constitutional claims and holding that the Georgia statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation, granted summary judgment to appellee as to liability, with the determination of. damages to await trial by jury.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court, in its initial opinion, held that the trial court had erred in construing 26-9901 to extend a civil cause of action for invasion of privacy, and thus found it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the statute.  231 Ga. 60, 200 S.E.2d 127 (1973).  The court went on to rule, however, that the complaint stated a cause of action "for the invasion of the appellee\'s right of privacy, or for the tort of public disclosure" -- a "common law tort exist[ing] in this jurisdiction without the help of the statute that the trial judge in this case relied on."  <em>Id.</em> at 62, 200 S.E.2d at 130.  Although the privacy invaded was not that of the deceased victim, the father was held to have stated a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 420 U. S. 475</a></p><p> claim for invasion of his own privacy by reason of the publication of his daughter\'s name.  The court explained, however, that liability did not follow as a matter of law, and that summary judgment was improper; whether the public disclosure of the name actually invaded appellee\'s "zone of privacy," and if so, to what extent, were issues to be determined by the trier of fact.  Also,</p>\n<p>"in formulating such an issue for determination by the factfinder, it is reasonable to require the appellee to prove that the appellants invaded his privacy with willful or negligent disregard for the fact that reasonable men would find the invasion highly offensive."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 64, 200 S.E.2d at 131.  The Georgia Supreme Court did agree with the trial court, however, that the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not, as a matter of law, require judgment for appellants.  The court concurred with the statement in <em>Briscoe v. Reader\'s Digest Assn., Inc.,</em> 4 Cal.3d 529, 541, 483 P.2d 34, 42 (1971), that</p>\n<p>"the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment do not require total abrogation of the right to privacy.  The goals sought by each may be achieved with a minimum of intrusion upon the other."</p>\n<p>Upon motion for rehearing, the Georgia court countered the argument that the victim\'s name was a matter of public interest, and could be published with impunity by relying on \xc2\xa7 26-9901 as an authoritative declaration of state policy that the name of a rape victim was not a matter of public concern.  This time the court felt compelled to determine the constitutionality of the statute, and sustained it as a "legitimate limitation on the right of freedom of expression contained in the First Amendment."  The court could discern</p>\n<p>"no public interest or general concern about the identity of the victim of such a crime as will make the right to disclose the identity of the victim rise to the level of First Amendment protection."</p>\n<p>231 Ga. at 68, 200 S.E.2d at 134. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 420 U. S. 476</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We postponed decision as to our jurisdiction over this appeal to the hearing on the merits.  415 U.S. 912 (1974).  We conclude that the Court has jurisdiction, and reverse the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2), and, if that jurisdictional basis is found to be absent, through a petition for certiorari under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2103.  Two questions concerning our jurisdiction must be resolved:  (1) whether the constitutional validity of \xc2\xa7 26-9901 was "drawn in question," with the Georgia Supreme Court upholding its validity, and (2) whether the decision from which this appeal has been taken is a "[f]inal judgment or decree."</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants clearly raised the issue of the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 26-9901 in their motion for rehearing in the Georgia Supreme Court.  In denying that motion, that court held:  "A majority of this court does not consider this statute to be in conflict with the First Amendment."  231 Ga. at 68, 200 S.E.2d at 134.  Since the court relied upon the statute as a declaration of the public policy of Georgia that the disclosure of a rape victim\'s name was not to be protected expression, the statute was drawn in question in a manner directly bearing upon the merits of the action, and the decision in favor of its constitutional validity invokes this Court\'s appellate jurisdiction.  <em>Cf. Garrity v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/493/case.html">385 U. S. 493</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/493/case.html#495">385 U. S. 495</a></span>-496 (1967).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Since 1789, Congress has granted this Court appellate jurisdiction with respect to state litigation only after the highest state court in which judgment could be had has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 420 U. S. 477</a></p><p> rendered a "[f]inal judgment or decree."  Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 retains this limitation on our power to review cases coming from state courts.  The Court has noted that "[c]onsiderations of English usage as well as those of judicial policy" would justify an interpretation of the final judgment rule to preclude review</p>\n<p>"where anything further remains to be determined by a State court, no matter how dissociated from the only federal issue that has finally been adjudicated by the highest court of the State."</p>\n<p><em>Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html">326 U. S. 120</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html#124">326 U. S. 124</a></span> (1945).  But the Court there observed that the rule had not been administered in such a mechanical fashion, and that there were circumstances in which there has been "a departure from this requirement of finality for federal appellate jurisdiction."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>These circumstances were said to be "very few," <em>ibid.;</em> but, as the cases have unfolded, the Court has recurringly encountered situations in which the highest court of a State has finally determined the federal issue present in a particular case, but in which there are further proceedings in the lower state courts to come.  There are now at least four categories of such cases in which the Court has treated the decision on the federal issue as a final judgment for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257 and has taken jurisdiction without awaiting the completion of the additional proceedings anticipated in the lower state courts.  In most, if not all, of the cases in these categories, these additional proceedings would not require the decision of other federal questions that might also require review by the Court at a later date, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and immediate, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 420 U. S. 478</a></p><p> rather than delayed, review would be the best way to avoid "the mischief of economic waste and of delayed justice," <em>Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html#124">326 U. S. 124</a></span>, as well as precipitate interference with state litigation. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In the cases in the first two categories considered below, the federal issue would not be mooted or otherwise affected by the proceedings yet to be had, because those proceedings have little substance, their outcome is certain, or they are wholly unrelated to the federal question.  In the other two categories, however, the federal issue would be mooted if the petitioner or appellant seeking to bring the action here prevailed on the merits in the later state court proceeding, but there is nevertheless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 420 U. S. 479</a></p><p> sufficient justification for immediate review of the federal question finally determined in the state courts.</p>\n<p>In the first category are those cases in which there are further proceedings -- even entire trials -- yet to occur in the state courts, but where, for one reason or another, the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained.  In these circumstances, because the case is, for all practical purposes, concluded, the judgment of the state court on the federal issue is deemed final.  In <em>Mills v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html">384 U. S. 214</a></span> (1966), for example, a demurrer to a criminal complaint was sustained on federal constitutional grounds by a state trial court.  The State Supreme Court reversed, remanding for jury trial.  This Court took jurisdiction on the reasoning that the appellant had no defense other than his federal claim, and could not prevail at trial on the facts or any nonfederal ground.  To dismiss the appeal</p>\n<p>"would not only be an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html#217">384 U. S. 217</a></span>-218 (footnote omitted). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 420 U. S. 480</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Second, there are cases such as <em>Radio Station WOW, supra,</em> and <em>Brady v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/case.html">373 U. S. 83</a></span> (1963), in which the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state court proceedings.  In <em>Radio Station WOW,</em> the Nebraska Supreme Court directed the transfer of the properties of a federally licensed radio station and ordered an accounting, rejecting the claim that the transfer order would interfere with the federal license.  The federal issue was held reviewable here despite the pending accounting on the</p>\n<p>"presupposition . . . that the federal questions that could come here have been adjudicated by the State court, and that the accounting which remains to be taken could not remotely give rise to a federal question . . . that may later come here. . . ."</p>\n<p>326 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html#127">326 U. S. 127</a></span>.  The judgment rejecting the federal claim and directing the transfer was deemed "dissociated from a provision for an accounting even though that is decreed in the same order."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html#126">326 U. S. 126</a></span>.  Nothing that could happen in the course of the accounting, short of settlement of the case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decision on the federal question.  Older cases in the Court had reached the same result on similar facts.  <em>Carondelet Canal &amp; Nav. Co. v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/362/case.html">233 U.

In the latter case, the Court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, stated that the Court had not understood the final judgment rule,</p>\n<p>"in this strict and technical sense, but has given [it] a more liberal, and, as we think, a more reasonable construction, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 420 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In the third category are those situations where the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case.  Thus, in these cases, if the party seeking interim review ultimately prevails on the merits, the federal issue will be mooted; if he were to lose on the merits, however, the governing state law would not permit him again to present his federal claims for review.  The Court has taken jurisdiction in these circumstances prior to completion of the case in the state courts.  <em>California v. Stewart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966) (decided with <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em>), epitomizes this category.  There, the state court reversed a conviction on federal constitutional grounds and remanded for a new trial.  Although the State might have prevailed at trial, we granted its petition for certiorari and affirmed, explaining that the state judgment was "final," since an acquittal of the defendant at trial would preclude, under state law, an appeal by the State.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#498">384 U.

The State Supreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 420 U. S. 482</a></p><p> Court held the statute unconstitutional and remanded the matter to the Board for further consideration of the application, freed from the constraints of the ownership statute.  The Board brought the case here, claiming that the statute was constitutionally acceptable under modern cases.  After reviewing the various circumstances under which the finality requirement has been deemed satisfied despite the fact that litigation had not terminated in the state courts, we entertained the case over claims that we had no jurisdiction.  The federal issue would not survive the remand, whatever the result of the state administrative proceedings.  The Board might deny the license on state law grounds, thus foreclosing the federal issue, and the Court also ascertained that, under state law, the Board could not bring the federal issue here in the event the applicant satisfied the requirements of state law except for the invalidated ownership statute.  Under these circumstances, the issue was ripe for review. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Lastly, there are those situations where the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 420 U. S. 483</a></p><p> litigation on the relevant cause of action, rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come.  In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the state court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.</p>\n<p>In <em>Construction Laborers v. Curry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/542/case.html">371 U. S. 542</a></span> (1963), the state courts temporarily enjoined labor union picketing over claims that the National Labor Relations Board had exclusive jurisdiction of the controversy.  The Court took jurisdiction for two independent reasons.  First, the power of the state court to proceed in the face of the preemption claim was deemed an issue separable from the merits and ripe for review in this Court, particularly</p>\n<p>"when postponing review would seriously erode the national labor policy requiring the subject matter of respondents\' cause to be heard by the . . .

Second, the Court was convinced that, in any event, the union had no defense to the entry of a permanent injunction other than the preemption claim that had already been ruled on in the state courts.  Hence, the case was, for all practical purposes, concluded in the state tribunals.</p>\n<p>In <em>Mercantile National Bank v.

The banks, as a preliminary matter, asserted that a special federal venue statute immunized them from suit in Travis County, and that they could properly be sued only in another county.  Although trial was still to be had and the banks might well prevail on the merits, the Court, relying on <em>Curry,</em> entertained the issue as a "separate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 420 U.

The State Supreme Court reversed, sustaining the statute against the challenge based upon the First and Fourteenth Amendments and remanding the case for a trial and appropriate relief, including damage.  The newspaper brought the case here.  We sustained our jurisdiction, relying on the principles elaborated in the North Dakota case and observing:</p>\n<p>"Whichever way we were to decide on the merits, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 420 U.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of the prior cases, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court rejecting the challenge under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the state law authorizing damage suits against the press for publishing the name of a rape victim whose identity is revealed in the course of a public prosecution.  The Georgia Supreme Court\'s judgment is plainly final on the federal issue, and is not subject to further review in the state courts.  Appellants will be liable for damages if the elements of the state cause of action are proved.  They may prevail at trial on nonfederal grounds, it is true, but if the Georgia court erroneously upheld the statute, there should be no trial at all.  Moreover, even if appellants prevailed at trial and made unnecessary further consideration of the constitutional question, there would remain in effect the unreviewed decision of the State Supreme Court that a civil action for publishing the name of a rape victim disclosed in a public judicial proceeding may go forward despite the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Delaying final </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 420 U.

S. 247</a></span> n. 6.  On the other hand, if we now hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments bar civil liability for broadcasting the victim\'s name, this litigation ends.  Given these factors -- that the litigation could be terminated by our decision on the merits [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and that a failure to decide the question now will leave the press in Georgia operating in the shadow of the civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and a statute the constitutionality of which is in serious doubt -- we find that reaching the merits is consistent with the pragmatic approach that we have followed in the past in determining finality.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 420 U.

Its claims are not without force, for powerful arguments can be made, and have been made, that however it may be ultimately defined, there s a zone of privacy surrounding every individual, a zone within which the State may protect him from intrusion by the press, with all its attendant publicity. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Indeed, the central thesis of the root article by Warren and Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv.L.Rev.193, 196 (1890), was that the press was overstepping its prerogatives by publishing essentially private information, and that there should be a remedy for the alleged abuses.

S. 488</a></p><p></p>\n<p>More compellingly, the century has experienced a strong tide running in favor of the so-called right of privacy.  In 1967, we noted that "[i]t has been said that a <em>right of privacy\' has been recognized at common law in 30 States plus the District of Columbia and by statute in four States."  <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html">385 U. S. 374</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html#383">385 U. S. 383</a></span> n. 7.  We there cited the 1964 edition of Prosser\'s Law of Torts.  The 1971 edition of that same source states that, "[i]n one form or another, the right of privacy is by this time recognized and accepted in all but a very few jurisdictions."  W. Prosser, Law of Torts 804 (4th ed.) (footnote omitted).  Nor is it irrelevant </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 420 U. S. 489</a></em></p><p><em> here that the right of privacy is no recent arrival in the jurisprudence of Georgia, which has embraced the right in some form since 1905, when the Georgia Supreme Court decided the leading case of <em>Pavesich v. New England Life Ins. Co.,</em> 122 Ga.190, 50 S.E. 68.\n</em></p>\n<p>These are impressive credentials for a right of privacy, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] but we should recognize that we do not have at issue here an action for the invasion of privacy involving the appropriation of one\'s name or photograph, a physical or other tangible intrusion into a private area, or a publication of otherwise private information that is also false, although perhaps not defamatory.  The version of the privacy tort now before US -- termed in Georgia "the tort of public disclosure" -- 231 Ga. at 60, 200 S.E.2d at 13, is that in which the plaintiff claims the right to be free from unwanted publicity about his private affairs, which, although wholly true, would be offensive to a person of ordinary sensibilities.  Because the gravamen of the claimed injury is the publication of information, whether true or not, the dissemination of which is embarrassing or otherwise painful to an individual, it is here that claims of privacy most directly confront the constitutional freedoms of speech and press.  The face-off is apparent, and the appellants urge upon us the broad holding that the press may not be made criminally or civilly liable for publishing information that is neither false nor misleading but absolutely accurate, however damaging it may be to reputation or individual sensibilities.</p>\n<p>It is true that, in defamation actions, where the protected interest is personal reputation, the prevailing view is that truth is a defense, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] and the message of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">New York</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 420 U.

What is more, the defamed public official or public figure must prove not only that the publication is false, but that it was knowingly so, or was circulated with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.  Similarly, where the interest at issue is privacy, rather than reputation, and the right claimed is to be free from the publication of false or misleading information about one\'s affairs, the target of the publication must prove knowing or reckless falsehood where the materials published, although assertedly private, are "matters of public interest."  <em>Time, Inc. v.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has nevertheless carefully left open the question whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that truth be recognized as a defense in a defamation action brought by a private person, as distinguished from a public official or public figure.  <em>Garrison</em> held that, where criticism is of a public official and his conduct of public business,</p>\n<p>"the interest in private reputation is overborne </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 420 U.

S. 383</a></span> n. 7.</p>\n<p>Those precedents, as well as other considerations, counsel similar caution here.  In this sphere of collision between claims of privacy and those of the free press, the interests on both sides are plainly rooted in the traditions and significant concerns of our society.  Rather than address the broader question whether truthful publications may ever be subjected to civil or criminal liability consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, or, to put it another way, whether the State may ever define and protect an area of privacy free from unwanted publicity in the press, it is appropriate to focus on the narrower interface between press and privacy that this case presents, namely, whether the State may impose sanctions on the accurate publication of the name of a rape victim obtained from public records -- more specifically, from judicial records which are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and which themselves are open to public inspection.  We are convinced that the State may not do so.</p>\n<p>In the first place, in a society in which each individual has but limited time and resources with which to observe at first hand the operations of his government, he relies necessarily upon the press to bring to him in convenient form the facts of those operations.  Great responsibility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 420 U. S. 492</a></p><p> is accordingly placed upon the news media to report fully and accurately the proceedings of government, and official records and documents open to the public are the basic data of governmental operations.  Without the information provided by the press, most of us and many of our representatives would be unable to vote intelligently or to register opinions on the administration of government generally.  With respect to judicial proceedings, in particular, the function of the press serves to guarantee the fairness of trials and to bring to bear the beneficial effects of public scrutiny upon the administration of justice.  <em>See Sheppard v. Maxwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/case.html">384 U. S. 333</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/case.html#350">384 U.

S. 252</a></span> (1941).</p>\n<p>The developing law surrounding the tort of invasion of privacy recognizes a privilege in the press to report the events of judicial proceedings.  The Warren and Brandeis article, <em>supra,</em> noted that the proposed new right would be limited in the same manner as actions for libel and slander where such a publication was a privileged communication:</p>\n<p>"the right to privacy is not invaded by any publication made in a court of justice . . . and (at least in many jurisdictions) reports of any such proceedings would, in some measure, be accorded a like privilege. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Restatement of Torts, \xc2\xa7 867, embraced an action for privacy. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Tentative Draft No. 13 of the Second Restatement of Torts, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 652A-652E, divides the privacy tort into four branches, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and, with respect to the wrong of giving unwanted publicity about private life, the commentary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 420 U. S. 494</a></p><p> to \xc2\xa7 652D states:</p>\n<p>"There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further publicity to information about the plaintiff which is already public.  Thus, there is no liability for giving publicity to facts about the plaintiff\'s life which are matters of public record. . . . [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]"</p>\n<p>The same is true of the separate tort of physically or otherwise intruding upon the seclusion or private affairs of another.  Section 652B, Comment , provides that</p>\n<p>"there is no liability for the examination of a public record concerning the plaintiff, or of documents which the plaintiff is required to keep and make available for public inspection. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]"</p>\n<p>According to this draft, ascertaining and publishing the contents of public records are simply not within the reach of these kinds of privacy actions. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, even the prevailing law of invasion of privacy generally recognizes that the interests in privacy fade </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 420 U. S. 495</a></p><p> when the information involved already appears on the public record.  The conclusion is compelling when viewed in terms of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and in light of the public interest in a vigorous press.  The Georgia cause of action for invasion of privacy through public disclosure of the name of a rape victim imposes sanctions on pure expression -- the content of a publication -- and not conduct or a combination of speech and nonspeech elements that might otherwise be open to regulation or prohibition.  <em>See United States v. O\'Brien,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html">391 U. S. 367</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#376">391 U. S. 376</a></span>-377 (1968).  The publication of truthful information available on the public record contains none of the indicia of those limited categories of expression, such as "fighting" words, which</p>\n<p>"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."</p>\n<p><em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html">315 U. S. 568</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html#572">315 U. S. 572</a></span> (1942) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>By placing the information in the public domain on official court records, the State must be presumed to have concluded that the public interest was thereby being served.  Public records, by their very nature, are of interest to those concerned with the administration of government, and a public benefit is performed by the reporting of the true contents of the records by the media.  The freedom of the press to publish that information appears to us to be of critical importance to our type of government, in which the citizenry is the final judge of the proper conduct of public business.  In preserving that form of government, the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 420 U. S. 496</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are reluctant to embark on a course that would make public records generally available to the media but forbid their publication if offensive to the sensibilities of the supposed reasonable man.  Such a rule would make it very difficult for the media to inform citizens about the public business and yet stay within the law.  The rule would invite timidity and self-censorship and very likely lead to the suppression of many items that would otherwise be published and that should be made available to the public.  At the very least, the First and Fourteenth Amendments will not allow exposing the press to liability for truthfully publishing information released to the public in official court records.  If there are privacy interests to be protected in judicial proceedings, the States must respond by means which avoid public documentation or other exposure of private information.  Their political institutions must weigh the interests in privacy with the interests of the public to know and of the press to publish. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Once true information is disclosed in public court documents open to public inspection, the press cannot be sanctioned for publishing it.

Such personal observations and notes were the primary and almost exclusive source of the information upon which the said news report was based.  Secondly, during a recess of the said trial, I approached the clerk of the court, who was sitting directly in front of the bench, and requested to see a copy of the indictments.  In open court, I was handed the indictments, both the murder and the rape indictments, and was allowed to examine fully this document.  As is shown by the said indictments . . . the name of the said Cynthia Cohn appears in clear type.

But it does so only to the extent of determining that the issue is substantial, and only in the context that, if the state court\'s final decision on the federal issue is incorrect, federal law forecloses further proceedings in the state court.  That the petitioner who protests against the state court\'s decision on the federal question might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds in the course of further proceedings anticipated in the state court, and hence obviate later review of the federal issue here, is not preclusive of our jurisdiction.  <em>Curry, Langdeau, North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy, California v.

The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency.  Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery.  To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers.  To occupy the indolent, column upon column is filled with idle gossip, which can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle.  The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.  Nor is the harm wrought by such invasions confined to the suffering of those who may be made the subjects of journalistic or other enterprise.  In this, as in other branches of commerce, the supply creates the demand.  Each crop of "</p>\n<p>brk:</p>\n<p>unseemly gossip, thus harvested, becomes the seed of more, and, in direct proportion to its circulation, results in a lowering of social standards and of morality.  Even gossip apparently harmless, when widely and persistently circulated, is potent for evil.  It both belittles and perverts.  It belittles by inverting the relative importance of things, thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of a people.  When personal gossip attains the dignity of print, and crowds the space available for matters of real interest to the community, what wonder that the ignorant and thoughtless mistake its relative importance.  Easy of comprehension, appealing to that weak side of human nature which is never wholly cast down by the misfortunes and frailties of our neighbors, no one can be surprised that it usurps the place of interest in brains capable of other things.  Triviality destroys at once robustness of thought and delicacy of feeling.  No enthusiasm can flourish, no generous impulse can survive under its blighting influence.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also Time, Inc. v.

JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in the Court\'s opinion, as I agree with the holding and most of its supporting rationale. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  My understanding of some of our decisions concerning the law of defamation, however, differs from that expressed in today\'s opinion.  Accordingly, I think it appropriate to state separately my views.</p>\n<p>I am in entire accord with the Court\'s determination that the First Amendment proscribes imposition of civil liability in a privacy action predicated on the truthful publication of matters contained in open judicial records.  But my impression of the role of truth in defamation actions brought by private citizens differs from the Court\'s.  The Court identifies as an "open" question the issue of</p>\n<p>"whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that truth be recognized as a defense in a defamation action brought by a private person, as distinguished </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 420 U. S. 498</a></p><p> from a public official or a public figure."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">420 U. S. 490</span>.  In my view, our recent decision in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html">418 U. S. 323</a></span> (1974), largely resolves that issue.</p>\n<p><em>Gertz</em> is the most recent of a line of cases in which this Court has sought to resolve the conflict between the State\'s desire to protect the reputational interests of its citizens and the competing commands of the First Amendment.  In each of the many defamation actions considered in the 10 years following <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span> (1964), state law provided that truth was a defense to the action. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Today\'s opinion reiterates what we previously have recognized, <em>see Garrison v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/64/case.html">379 U. S. 64</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/64/case.html#74">379 U. S. 74</a></span> (1964) -- that the defense of truth is constitutionally required when the subject of the alleged defamation is a public figure.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#489">420 U. S. 489</a></span>-490.  Indeed, even if not explicitly recognized, this determination is implicit in the Court\'s articulation of a standard of recovery that rests on knowing or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 420 U. S. 499</a></p><p> reckless disregard of the truth.  I think that the constitutional necessity of recognizing a defense of truth is equally implicit in our statement of the permissible standard of liability for the publication or broadcast of defamatory statements whose substance makes apparent the substantial danger of injury to the reputation of a private citizen.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gertz,</em> we held that the First Amendment prohibits the States from imposing strict liability for media publication of allegedly false statements that are claimed to defame a private individual.  While providing the required "breathing space" for First Amendment freedoms, the <em>Gertz</em> standard affords the States substantial latitude in compensating private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>"[S]o long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual."</p>\n<p>418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#347">418 U. S. 347</a></span>.  The requirement that the state standard of liability be related to the defendant\'s failure to avoid publication of "defamatory falsehood" limits the grounds on which a normal action for defamation can be brought.  It is fair to say that, if the statements are true, the standard contemplated by <em>Gertz</em> cannot be satisfied.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gertz,</em> we recognized the need to establish a broad rule of general applicability, acknowledging that such an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 420 U. S. 500</a></p><p> approach necessarily requires treating alike cases that involve differences, as well as similarities.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html#343">418 U. S. 343</a></span>-344.  Of course, no rule of law is infinitely elastic.  In some instances, State actions that are denominated actions in defamation may, in fact, seek to protect citizens from injuries that are quite different from the wrongful damage to reputation flowing from false statements of fact.  In such cases, the Constitution may permit a different balance to be struck.  And, as today\'s opinion properly recognizes, causes of action grounded in a State\'s desire to protect privacy generally implicate interests that are distinct from those protected by defamation actions.  But in cases in which the interests sought to be protected are similar to those considered in <em>Gertz,</em> I view that opinion as requiring that the truth be recognized as a complete defense.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>At the outset, I note my agreement that <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/case.html">418 U. S. 241</a></span> (1974), supports the conclusion that the issue presented in this appeal is final for review.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Time, Inc. v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html">385 U. S. 374</a></span> (1967), the Court considered a state cause of action that afforded protection against unwanted publicity, rather than damage to reputation through the publication of false statements of fact.  In such actions, however, the State also recognized that truth was an absolute defense against liability for publication of reports concerning newsworthy people or events.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html#383">385 U.

Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html">326 U.

S. 124</a></span>.  Over the years, however, and despite vigorous protest by Mr. Justice Harlan, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] this Court has steadily discovered new exceptions to the finality requirement, such that they can hardly any longer be described as "very few."  Whatever may be the unexpressed reasons for this process of expansion, <em>see, e.g., Hudson Distributors v. Eli Lilly,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/386/case.html">377 U. S. 386</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/386/case.html#401">377 U. S. 401</a></span> (1964) (Harlan, J., dissenting), it has frequently been the subject of no more formal an express explanation than cursory citations to preceding cases in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 420 U. S. 502</a></p><p> the line.  Especially is this true of cases in which the Court, as it does today, relies on <em>Construction Laborers v. Curry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/542/case.html">371 U. S. 542</a></span> (1963). [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Although the Court\'s opinion today does accord detailed consideration to this problem, I do not believe that the reasons it expresses can support its result.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court has taken what it terms a "pragmatic" approach to the finality problem presented in this ease.  In so doing, it has relied heavily on <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/148/case.html">379 U. S. 148</a></span> (194).  As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#478">420 U. S. 478</a></span> n. 7, <em>Gillespie</em> involved 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291, which restricts the appellate jurisdiction of the federal courts of appeals to "final decisions of the district court."  Although acknowledging this distinction, the Court accords it no importance, and adopts <em>Gillespie\'s</em> approach without any consideration of whether the finality requirement for this Court\'s jurisdiction over a "judgment or decree" of a state court is grounded on more serious concerns than is the limitation of court of appeals jurisdiction to final "decisions" of the district courts. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  I believe that the underlying concerns are different, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 420 U. S. 503</a></p><p> and that the difference counsels a more restrictive approach when \xc2\xa7 1257 finality is at issue.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Gillespie,</em> the finality requirement is imposed as a matter of minimizing "the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review."  This proposition is undoubtedly sound so long as one is considering the administration of the federal court system.  Were judicial efficiency the only interest at stake, there would be less inclination to challenge the Court\'s resolution in this case, although, as discussed below, I have serious reservations that the standards the Court has formulated are effective for achieving even this single goal.  The case before us, however, is an appeal from a state court, and this fact introduces additional interests which must be accommodated in fashioning any exception to the literal application of the finality requirement.  I consider \xc2\xa7 1257 finality to be but one of a number of congressional provisions reflecting concern that uncontrolled federal judicial interference with state administrative and judicial functions would have untoward consequences for our federal system. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  This is by no means a novel view of the \xc2\xa7 1257 finality requirement.  In <em>Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson,</em> 326 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/120/case.html#124">326 U. S. 124</a></span>, Mr. Justice Frankfurter\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 420 U. S. 504</a></p><p> opinion for the Court explained the finality requirement as follows:</p>\n<p>"This requirement has the support of considerations generally applicable to good judicial administration.  It avoids the mischief of economic waste and of delayed justice.  Only in very few situations, where intermediate rulings may carry serious public consequences, has there been a departure from this requirement of finality for federal appellate jurisdiction.  This prerequisite to review derives added force when the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked to upset the decision of a State court.  Here we are in the realm of potential conflict between the courts of two different governments.  And so, ever since 1789, Congress has granted this Court the power to intervene in State litigation only after \'the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had\' has rendered a \'final judgment or decree.\'  \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 344(a).  <em>This requirement is not one of those technicalities to be easily scorned.  It is an important factor in the smooth working of our federal system.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  In <em>Republic Gas Co. v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/62/case.html">334 U. S. 62</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/62/case.html#67">334 U. S. 67</a></span> (1948), Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court, again expressed this view:</p>\n<p>"This prerequisite for the exercise of the appellate powers of this Court is especially pertinent when a constitutional barrier is asserted against a State court\'s decision on matters peculiarly of local concern.  Close observance of this limitation upon the Court is not regard for a strangling technicality.  History bears ample testimony that it is an important factor in securing harmonious State-federal relations. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 420 U. S. 505</a></p><p></p>\n<p>That comity and federalism are significant elements of \xc2\xa7 1257 finality has been recognized by other members of the Court as well, perhaps most notably by Mr. Justice Harlan.  <em>See, e.g., Hudson Distributors v. Eli Lilly,</em> 377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/386/case.html#397">377 U. S. 397</a></span>-398 (dissenting); <em>Mercantile National Bank v.

In the latter dissent, he argued that one basis of the finality rule was that it foreclosed</p>\n<p>"this Court from passing on constitutional issues that may be dissipated by the final outcome of a case, thus helping to keep to a minimum undesirable federal-state conflicts."</p>\n<p>One need cast no doubt on the Court\'s decision in such cases as <em>Langdeau</em> to recognize that Mr. Justice Harlan was focusing on a consideration which should be of significance in the Court\'s disposition of this case.</p>\n<p>"Harmonious state-federal relations" are no less important today than when Mr. Justice Frankfurter penned <em>Radio Station WOW</em> and <em>Republic Gas Co.</em>  Indeed, we have in recent years emphasized and reemphasized the importance of comity and federalism in dealing with a related problem, that of district court interference with ongoing state judicial proceedings.  <em>See Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span> (1971); <em>Samuels v. Mackell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/66/case.html">401 U. S. 66</a></span> (1971).  Because these concerns are important, and because they provide "added force" to \xc2\xa7 1257\'s finality requirement, I believe that the Court has erred by simply importing the approach of cases in which the only concern is efficient judicial administration.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>But quite apart from the considerations of federalism which counsel against an expansive reading of our jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1257, the Court\'s holding today enunciates a virtually formless exception to the finality requirement, one which differs in kind from those previously carved out.  By contrast, <em>Construction Laborers v. Curry, supra,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 420 U. S. 506</a></p><p> and <em>Mercantile National Bank v. Langdeau, supra,</em> are based on the understandable principle that, where the proper forum for trying the issue joined in the state courts depends on the resolution of the federal question raised on appeal, sound judicial administration requires that such a question be decided by this Court, if it is to be decided at all, sooner, rather than later in the course of the litigation.  <em>Organization for a Better Austin v.

Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/case.html">373 U.

While the totality of these exceptions certainly indicates that the Court has been willing to impart to the language "final judgment or decree" a great deal of flexibility, each of them is arguably consistent with the intent of Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 1257, if not with the language it used, and each of them is relatively workable in practice.</p>\n<p>To those established exceptions is now added one so </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 420 U. S. 507</a></p><p> formless that it cannot be paraphrased, but instead must be quoted:</p>\n<p>"Given these factors -- that the litigation could be terminated by our decision on the merits and that a failure to decide the question now will leave the press in Georgia operating in the shadow of the civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and a statute the constitutionality of which is in serious doubt -- we find that reaching the merits is consistent with the pragmatic approach that we have followed in the past in determining finality."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#486">420 U. S. 486</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There are a number of difficulties with this test.  One of them is the Court\'s willingness to look to the merits.  It is not clear from the Court\'s opinion, however, exactly how great a look at the merits we are to take.  On the one hand, the Court emphasizes that, if we reverse the Supreme Court of Georgia, the litigation will end, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#485">420 U. S. 485</a></span>-486, and it refers to cases in which the federal issue has been decided "arguably wrongly."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#486">420 U. S. 486</a></span> n. 13.  On the other hand, it claims to look to the merits "only to the extent of determining that the issue is substantial."  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the latter is all the Court means, then the inquiry is no more extensive than is involved when we determine whether a case is appropriate for plenary consideration; but if no more is meant, our decision is just as likely to be a costly intermediate step in the litigation as it is to be the concluding event.  If, on the other hand, the Court really intends its doctrine to reach only so far as cases in which our decision in all probability will terminate the litigation, then the Court is reversing the traditional sequence of judicial decisionmaking.  Heretofore, it has generally been thought that a court first assumed jurisdiction of a case, and then went on to decide the merits of the questions it presented.  But henceforth, in determining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 420 U. S. 508</a></p><p> our own jurisdiction, we may be obliged to determine whether or not we agree with the merits of the decision of the highest court of a State.</p>\n<p>Yet another difficulty with the Court\'s formulation is the problem of transposing to any other case the requirement that</p>\n<p>"failure to decide the question now will leave the press in Georgia operating in the shadow of the civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and a statute the constitutionality of which is in serious doubt."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/469/case.html#486">420 U. S. 486</a></span>.  Assuming that we are to make this determination of "serious doubt" at the time we note probable jurisdiction of such an appeal, is it enough that the highest court of the State has ruled against any federal constitutional claim?  If that is the case, then because \xc2\xa7 1257, by other language, imposes that requirement, we will have completely read out of the statute the limitation of our jurisdiction to a "final judgment or decree."  Perhaps the Court\'s new standard for finality is limited to cases in which a First Amendment freedom is at issue.  The language used by Congress, however, certainly provides no basis for preferring the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, to the various other Amendments which are likewise "incorporated," or indeed for preferring any of the "incorporated" Amendments over the due process and equal protection provisions which are embodied literally in the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that, in applying the second prong of its test, the Court has not engaged in any independent inquiry as to the consequences of permitting the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia to remain undisturbed pending final state court resolution of the case.  This suggests that, in order to invoke the benefit of today\'s rule, the "shadow" in which an appellant must stand need be neither deep nor wide.  In this case, nothing more is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 420 U. S. 509</a></p><p> at issue than the right to report the name of the victim of a rape.  No hindrance of any sort has been imposed on reporting the fact of a rape or the circumstances surrounding it.  Yet the Court unquestioningly places this issue on a par with the core First Amendment interest involved in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/case.html">418 U. S. 241</a></span> (1974), and <em>Mills v. Alabama, supra,</em> that of protecting the press in its role of providing uninhibited political discourse. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>But the greatest difficulty with the test enunciated today is that it totally abandons the principle that constitutional issues are too important to be decided save when absolutely necessary, and are to be avoided if there are grounds for decision of lesser dimension. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  The long line of cases which established this rule makes clear that it is a principle primarily designed not to benefit the lower courts or state-federal relations, but rather to safeguard this Court\'s own process of constitutional adjudication.</p>\n<p>"Considerations of propriety, as well as long-established practice, demand that we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress unless obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 420 U.

In this case, there has yet to be an adjudication of liability against appellants, and, unlike the appellant in <em>Mills v. Alabama,</em> they do not concede that they have no nonfederal defenses.  Nonetheless, the Court rules on their constitutional defense.  Far from eschewing a constitutional holding in advance of the necessity for one, the Court construes \xc2\xa7 1257 so that it may virtually rush out and meet the prospective constitutional litigant as he approaches our doors.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This Court is obliged to make preliminary determinations of its jurisdiction at the time it votes to note probable jurisdiction.  At that stage of the proceedings, prior to briefing on the merits or oral argument, such determinations must of necessity be based on relatively cursory acquaintance with the record of the proceedings below.  The need for an understandable and workable application of a jurisdictional provision such as \xc2\xa7 1257 is therefore far greater than for a similar interpretation of statutes dealing with substantive law. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  We, of course, retain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 420 U. S. 511</a></p><p> the authority to dismiss a case for want of a final judgment after having studied briefs on the merits and having heard oral argument, but I can recall not a single instance of such a disposition during the last three Terms of the Court.  While in theory this may be explained by saying that, during these Terms, we have never accorded plenary consideration to a \xc2\xa7 1257 case which was not a "final judgment or decree," I would guess it just as accurate to say that, after the Court has studied briefs and heard oral argument, it has an understandable tendency to proceed to a decision on the merits in preference to dismissing for want of jurisdiction.  It is thus especially disturbing that the rule of this case, unlike the more workable and straightforward exceptions which the Court has previously formulated, will seriously compound the already difficult task of accurately determining, at a preliminary stage, whether an appeal from a state court judgment is a "final judgment or decree."</p>\n<p>A further aspect of the difficulties which the Court is generating is illustrated by a petition for certiorari recently filed in this Court, <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone,</em> No. 74-944.  The case was twice before the Florida Supreme Court.  That court\'s first decision was rendered in December, 1972; it rejected Time\'s First Amendment defense to a libel action and remanded for further proceedings on state law issues.  The second decision was rendered in 1974, and dealt with the state law issues litigated on remand.  Before this Court, Time seeks review of the First Amendment defense rejected by the Florida Supreme Court in December, 1972.  Under the Court\'s decision today, one could conclude that the 1972 judgment was itself a final decision from which review might </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 420 U. S. 512</a></p><p> have been had.  If it was, then petitioner Time is confronted by 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2101(c), which restricts this Court\'s jurisdiction over state civil cases to those in which review is sought within 90 days of the entry of a reviewable judgment.</p>\n<p>I in no way suggest either my own or the Court\'s views on our jurisdiction over <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone.</em>  This example is simply illustrative of the difficulties which today\'s decision poses not only for this Court, but also for a prudent counsel who is faced with an adverse interlocutory ruling by a State\'s highest court on a federal issue asserted as a dispositive bar to further litigation.  I suppose that such counsel would be unwilling to presume that this Court would flout both the meaning of words and the command of Congress by employing loose standards of finality to obtain jurisdiction, but strict ones to prevent its loss.  He thus would be compelled to judge his situation in light of today\'s formless, unworkable exception to the finality requirement.  I would expect him frequently to choose to seek immediate review in this Court, solely as a matter of assuring that his federal contentions are not lost for want of timely filing.  The inevitable result will be totally unnecessary additions to our docket and serious interruptions and delays of the state adjudicatory process.</p>\n<p>Although unable to persuade my Brethren that we do not have in this case a final judgment or decree of the Supreme Court of Georgia, I nonetheless take heart from the fact that we are concerned here with an area in which "<em>stare decisis</em> has historically been accorded considerably less than its usual weight."  <em>Gonzalez v.

Section 6 of that Act provided that courts of appeals should exercise appellate jurisdiction over "final decision" of the federal trial courts.  The House version of the Act had referred to "final judgment or decree," 21 Cong.Rec. 3402 (1890), but the Senate Judiciary Committee changed the wording without formal explanation.  <em>See id.</em> at 10218.  Perhaps significance can be attached to the fact that, under the House bill, the courts of appeals would have been independent of the federal trial courts, being manned by full-time appellate judges; the Senate version, on the other hand, generally provided that court of appeals duties would be performed by the trial judges within each circuit.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 3, 26 Stat. 827.</p>\n<p>The first Judiciary Act, Act of Sept. 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, used the terms "judgment" and "decree" in defining the appellate jurisdiction of both the Supreme Court, \xc2\xa7 25, and the original circuit courts.  \xc2\xa7 22.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/4" name="F3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341 (limitation on power of district courts to enjoin state taxing systems); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1739 (requiring that state judicial proceedings be accorded full faith and credit in federal courts); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2253-2254 (prescribing various restrictions on federal habeas corpus for state prisoners); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 (three-judge district court requirement); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283 (restricting power of federal courts to enjoin state court proceedings).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>As pointed out in <em>Tornillo,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/case.html#247">418 U.
