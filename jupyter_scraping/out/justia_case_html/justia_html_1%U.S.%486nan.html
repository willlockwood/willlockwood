Continental Money, at 70 for one have reduced the balance of L2455. 13, 4. Specie, due to Blair M\'Clenachan in 1776, by a scale of depreciation of 70 for one, so that instead of L2445. 13. 4. Blair M\'Clenachan has credit for about L35 .1. 8. specie. 3. For that in an item of L 6403. 17. 8. Continental Money, on a transaction of November 1778 to the debit of Blair M\'Clenachan, they have ommitted to charge him with that sum in November 1778, and reduce it by the scale of 70 for one, as they did the balance in August, but have taken that single item out of the general, mass of the account, which amounts to upwards of L360 000, Continental Money, and reduced it by a scale of 6 for one; which, upon their own principles, will turn to the disadvantage of Blair M\'Clenachan L 975. 16. 7. specie. 4. That Blair M\'Clenachan, in September 1777, drew a bill of exchange on Neury, payable in London, for L. 200 sterling, in favor of John Pringle, which was protested; and the Defendant, Blair M\'Clenachan, never had notice thereof, until the latter end of 1778, or beginning of 1779, and the Referees have charged the Defendant for the same, the sum of L.656. 19. 3. specie, and by reason of the Referees having scaled the aforesaid balance of L.21191 13. 0. at 70 for one, the said Blair M\'Clenachan, has to his credit for the said bill only the sum of L. 8. 11. 5. specie. After argument, the President delivered the opinion of the Court as follows: </p><p> Shippen, President. The court have deliberately considered this case, and are unanimously of opinion, that the Referees, although men of knowledge and integrity, have hastily adopted a principle not warranted by law, which, it sanctified by this court, would be productive of manifest injustice. The accounts that had been exhibited by one party to the other, were certainly evidence against him who exhibited them, as to the articles which they contained, but could not be considered as evidence, much less conclusive evidence, of what was not stated or distinguished in them; I mean, the value of the specie and depreciated money. This appears to have been a principal subject of dispute between the parties, and ought to have been open to discussion before the Referees. Yet, under the idea that this was conclusive evidence, they have totally refused to consider the items of the account as to their real value, or to exercise their judgments upon them; but, by applying a certain rate of depreciation to the balance of the whole account, they have involved a large sum of hard money in a depreciation of seventy for one. They have also sealed sums which had been omitted in the accounts, in a very different manner from what they have done other advances made about the same time, by which an unequal measure of justice is dealt out to the parties. <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="488">[1 U.S. 486, 488]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1907551">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> PRINGLE v.
