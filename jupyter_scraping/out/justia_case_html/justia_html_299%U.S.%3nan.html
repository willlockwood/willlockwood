The provision in the contract between the Chevrolet Motor Company and dealers is as follows:</p>\n<p>"Dealer agrees that he will not sell, offer for sale, or use in the repair of Chevrolet motor vehicles and chassis second-hand or used parts or any part or parts not manufactured by or authorized by the Chevrolet Motor Company.  It is agreed that Dealer is not granted any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 299 U. S. 4</a></p><p> exclusive selling rights in genuine new Chevrolet parts or accessories."</p>\n<p>There is a similar provision in contracts made by the Buick Company.</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the bill of complaint for want of equity, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.  80 F.2d 641.  Upon the evidence adduced at the trial, the District Court found that the effect of the clause had not been in any way substantially to lessen competition or to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.  This finding was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals.  80 F.2d 641 at 644.</p>\n<p>Under the established rule, this Court accepts the findings in which two courts concur unless clear error is shown.  <em>Stuart v.
