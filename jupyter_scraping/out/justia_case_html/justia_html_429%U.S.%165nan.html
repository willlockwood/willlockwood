Reported below:  511 F.2d 744.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Certiorari was granted to consider the question presented:  whether, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a Mississippi public school board may terminate the employment of teachers sending their children not to public schools, but to a private racially segregated school.  However, since the grant of certiorari, <em>Runyon v. McCrary,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/case.html">427 U. S. 160</a></span> (1976), held that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1981 prohibits private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are Negroes.  Moreover, a Mississippi statute, Miss.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 37-9-59 (Supp. 1976), enacted in 1974 after the school board action here complained of, prohibits school boards</p>\n<p>"from denying employment or reemployment to any person . . . for the single reason that any eligible child of such person </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 429 U. S. 166</a></p><p> does not attend the school system in which such [person] is employed."</p>\n<p>Though \xc2\xa7 37-9-59 was cited in the record at the time of granting the writ, examination of the merits on oral argument in light of <em>Runyon v. McCrary</em> and \xc2\xa7 379-59 satisfies us that the grant was improvident.  Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.  <em>Cf. Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/70/case.html">349 U. S. 70</a></span> (1955).</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>I join in the Court\'s disposition of this case.  In doing so, I emphasize that our decision to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted intimates no view on the question of when, if ever, public school teachers -- or any comparable public employees -- may be required, as a condition of their employment, to enroll their children in any particular school or refrain from sending them to a school which they, as parents, in their sole discretion, consider desirable.  Few familial decisions are as immune from governmental interference as parents\' choice of a school for their children, so long as the school chosen otherwise meets the educational standards imposed by the State.  <em>See Pierce v.
