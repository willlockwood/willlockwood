Hawkins for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and to the judges thereof, commanding them to receive and duly consider certain depositions or further proofs taken by petitioner on appeal in an action pending in that court wherein he is the libellant and appellee.  The depositions in question were suppressed by the court on motion and for reasons given.</p>\n<p>We cannot, by mandamus, review the judicial action thus had in the exercise of legitimate jurisdiction.  <em>In re Morrison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/147/14/case.html">147 U.
