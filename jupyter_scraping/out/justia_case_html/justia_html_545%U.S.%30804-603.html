Grable subsequently brought a quiet title action in state court, claiming that Darue\xe2\x80\x99s title was invalid because 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76335 required the IRS to give Grable notice of the sale by personal service, not certified mail.  Darue removed the case to Federal District Court as presenting a federal question because the title claim depended on an interpretation of federal tax law.  The District Court declined to remand the case, finding that it posed a significant federal-law question, and it granted Darue summary judgment on the merits.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari on the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The national interest in providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial to support the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction over the disputed issue on removal.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Darue was entitled to remove the quiet title action if Grable could have brought it in federal court originally, as a civil action \xe2\x80\x9carising under the \xe2\x80\xa6 laws \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  Federal-question jurisdiction is usually invoked by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law, but this Court has also long recognized that such jurisdiction will lie over some state-law claims that implicate significant federal issues, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/255/180/index.html">255 U. S. 180</a>.  Such federal jurisdiction demands not only a contested federal issue, but a substantial one.  And the jurisdiction must be consistent with congressional judgment about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts governing \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s application.  These considerations have kept the Court from adopting a single test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law claims between nondiverse parties.  Instead, the question is whether the state-law claim necessarily stated a federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing a congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This case warrants federal jurisdiction.  Grable premised its superior title claim on the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s failure to give adequate notice, as defined by federal law.  Whether Grable received notice is an essential element of its quiet title claim, and the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is actually disputed.  The meaning of a federal tax provision is an important federal-law issue that belongs in federal court.  The Government has a strong interest in promptly collecting delinquent taxes, and the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s ability to satisfy its claims from delinquents\xe2\x80\x99 property requires clear terms of notice to assure buyers like Darue that the IRS has good title.  Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a federal-law issue, federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.  This conclusion puts the Court in venerable company, quiet title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims.  <em>E.g., Hopkins</em> v. <em>Walker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/244/486/index.html">244 U. S. 486</a>, 490\xe2\x80\x93491.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/804/index.html">478 U. S. 804</a>, is not to the contrary.  There, in finding federal jurisdiction unavailable for a state tort claim resting in part on an allegation that the defendant drug company had violated a federal branding law, the Court noted that Congress had not provided a private federal cause of action for such violations.  <em>Merrell Dow </em>cannot be read to make a federal cause of action a necessary condition for federal-question jurisdiction.  It disclaimed the adoption of any bright-line rule and expressly approved the exercise of jurisdiction in <em>Smith, </em>where there was no federal cause of action.  Accordingly, <em>Merrell Dow</em> should be read in its entirety as treating the absence of such cause as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the \xe2\x80\x9csensitive judgments about congressional intent,\xe2\x80\x9d required by \xc2\xa71331.  <em>Id.,</em> at 810.  In <em>Merrell Dow</em>, the principal significance of this absence was its bearing on the consequences to the federal system.  If the federal labeling standard without a cause of action could get a state claim into federal court, so could any other federal standards without causes of action.  And that would mean an enormous number of cases.  A comparable analysis yields a different jurisdictional conclusion here, because state quiet title actions rarely involve contested federal-law issues.

We answer no, and hold that the national interest in providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial to support the exercise of federal question jurisdiction over the disputed issue on removal, which would not distort any division of labor between\nthe state and federal courts, provided or assumed by Congress.    </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994, the Internal Revenue Service seized Michigan real property belonging to petitioner Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc., to satisfy Grable\xe2\x80\x99s federal tax delinquency.  Title 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76335 required the IRS to give notice of the seizure, and there is no dispute that Grable received actual notice by certified mail before the IRS sold the property to respondent Darue Engineering &amp; Manufacturing.  Although Grable also received notice of the sale itself, it did not exercise its statutory right to redeem the property within 180 days of the sale, \xc2\xa76337(b)(1), and after that period had passed, the Government gave Darue a quitclaim deed.  \xc2\xa76339.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Five years later, Grable brought a quiet title action in state court, claiming that Darue\xe2\x80\x99s record title was invalid because the IRS had failed to notify Grable of its seizure of the property in the exact manner required by \xc2\xa76335(a), which provides that written notice must be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven by the Secretary to the owner of the property [or] left at his usual place of abode or business.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grable said that the statute required personal service, not service by certified mail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Darue removed the case to Federal District Court as presenting a federal question, because the claim of title depended on the interpretation of the notice statute in the federal tax law.  The District Court declined to remand the case at Grable\xe2\x80\x99s behest after finding that the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim does pose a significant question of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 17 (Apr. 2, 2001), and ruling that Grable\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a federal right of action to enforce its claim against Darue did not bar the exercise of federal jurisdiction.  On the merits, the court granted summary judgment to Darue, holding that although \xc2\xa76335 by its terms required personal service, substantial compliance with the statute was enough.  207 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 694 (WD Mich. 2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  377 F.\xc2\xa03d 592 (2004).  On the jurisdictional question, the panel thought it sufficed that the title claim raised an issue of federal law that had to be resolved, and implicated a substantial federal interest (in construing federal tax law).  The court went on to affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on the merits.  We granted certiorari on the jurisdictional question alone,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] 543 U.

S. 804</a> (1986), always requires a federal cause of action as a condition for exercising federal-question jurisdiction.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Darue was entitled to remove the quiet title action if Grable could have brought it in federal district court originally, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441(a), as a civil action \xe2\x80\x9carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71331.  This provision for federal-question jurisdiction is invoked by and large by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law (<em>e.g.</em>, claims under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983).  There is, however, another longstanding, if less frequently encountered, variety of federal \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, this Court having recognized for nearly 100 years that in certain cases federal question jurisdiction will lie over state-law claims that implicate significant federal issues.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Hopkins</em> v. <em>Walker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/244/486/index.html">244 U. S. 486</a>, 490\xe2\x80\x93491 (1917).  The doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federal court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law, and thus justify resort to the experience, solicitude, and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues, see ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts 164\xe2\x80\x93166 (1968).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The classic example is <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/255/180/index.html">255 U. S. 180</a> (1921), a suit by a shareholder claiming that the defendant corporation could not lawfully buy certain bonds of the National Government because their issuance was unconstitutional.  Although Missouri law provided the cause of action, the Court recognized federal-question jurisdiction because the principal issue in the case was the federal constitutionality of the bond issue.  <em>Smith</em> thus held, in a somewhat generous statement of the scope of the doctrine, that a state-law claim could give rise to federal-question jurisdiction so long as it \xe2\x80\x9cappears from the [complaint] that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of [federal law].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 199.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Smith</em> statement has been subject to some trimming to fit earlier and later cases recognizing the vitality of the basic doctrine, but shying away from the expansive view that mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will suffice to open the \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d door.  As early as 1912, this Court had confined federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims to those that \xe2\x80\x9creally and substantially involv[e] a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of [federal] law.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Shulthis</em> v. <em>McDougal,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/225/561/index.html"></a><a href="/us/225/561/index.html">225 U. S. 561</a>, 569 (1912).  This limitation was the ancestor of Justice Cardozo\xe2\x80\x99s later explanation that a request to exercise federal-question jurisdiction over a state action calls for a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations\xe2\x80\x9d that present a federal issue, in \xe2\x80\x9ca selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gully</em> v. <em>First Nat. Bank in Meridian,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/index.html">299 U. S. 109</a>, 117\xe2\x80\x93118 (1936).  It has in fact become a constant refrain in such cases that federal jurisdiction demands not only a contested federal issue, but a substantial one, indicating a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>International College of Surgeons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/156/index.html">522 U. S. 156</a>, 164 (1997); <em>Merrell Dow, supra, </em>at 814, and n.\xc2\xa012; <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1/index.html">463 U. S. 1</a>, 28 (1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even when the state action discloses a contested and substantial federal question, the exercise of federal jurisdiction is subject to a possible veto.  For the federal issue will ultimately qualify for a federal forum only if federal jurisdiction is consistent with congressional judgment about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts governing the application of \xc2\xa71331.  Thus, <em>Franchise Tax Bd.</em> explained that the appropriateness of a federal forum to hear an embedded issue could be evaluated only after considering the \xe2\x80\x9cwelter of issues regarding the interrelation of federal and state authority and the proper management of the federal judicial system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 8.  Because arising-under jurisdiction to hear a state-law claim always raises the possibility of upsetting the state-federal line drawn (or at least assumed) by Congress, the presence of a disputed federal issue and the ostensible importance of a federal forum are never necessarily dispositive; there must always be an assessment of any disruptive portent in exercising federal jurisdiction.  See also <em>Merrell Dow, supra, </em>at 810.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations have kept us from stating a \xe2\x80\x9csingle, precise, all-embracing\xe2\x80\x9d test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law claims between nondiverse parties.  <em>Christianson</em> v. <em>Colt Industries Operating Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/800/index.html">486 U. S. 800</a>, 821 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring).  We have not kept them out simply because they appeared in state raiment, as Justice Holmes would have done, see <em>Smith</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 214 (dissenting opinion), but neither have we treated \xe2\x80\x9cfederal issue\xe2\x80\x9d as a password opening federal courts to any state action embracing a point of federal law.  Instead, the question is, does a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case warrants federal jurisdiction.  Grable\xe2\x80\x99s state complaint must specify \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts establishing the superiority of [its] claim,\xe2\x80\x9d Mich. Ct. Rule 3.411(B)(2)(c) (West 2005), and Grable has premised its superior title claim on a failure by the IRS to give it adequate notice, as defined by federal law.  Whether Grable was given notice within the meaning of the federal statute is thus an essential element of its quiet title claim, and the meaning of the federal statute is actually in dispute; it appears to be the only legal or factual issue contested in the case.  The meaning of the federal tax provision is an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs in a federal court.  The Government has a strong interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cprompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rodgers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/677/index.html">461 U. S. 677</a>, 709 (1983), and the ability of the IRS to satisfy its claims from the property of delinquents requires clear terms of notice to allow buyers like Darue to satisfy themselves that the Service has touched the bases necessary for good title.  The Government thus has a direct interest in the availability of a federal forum to vindicate its own administrative action, and buyers (as well as tax delinquents) may find it valuable to come before judges used to federal tax matters.  Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a contested matter of federal law, federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.  See n.\xc2\xa03, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion puts us in venerable company, quiet title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims.  In <em>Hopkins,</em> 244 U. S., 490\xe2\x80\x93491, the question was federal jurisdiction over a quiet title action based on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegation that federal mining law gave them the superior claim.  Just as in this case, \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts showing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 title and the existence and invalidity of the instrument or record sought to be eliminated as a cloud upon the title are essential parts of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 490.  As in this case again, \xe2\x80\x9cit is plain that a controversy respecting the construction and effect of the [federal] laws is involved and is sufficiently real and substantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 489.  This Court therefore upheld federal jurisdiction in <em>Hopkins</em>, as well as in the similar quiet title matters of <em>Northern Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Soderberg,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/188/526/index.html">188 U. S. 526</a>, 528 (1903), and <em>Wilson Cypress Co.</em> v. <em>Del Pozo y Marcos,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/236/635/index.html">236 U. S. 635</a>, 643\xe2\x80\x93644 (1915).  Consistent with those cases, the recognition of federal jurisdiction is in order here.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/804/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/804/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/804/index.html">478 U. S. 804</a> (1986), on which Grable rests its position, is not to the contrary.  <em>Merrell Dow</em> considered a state tort claim resting in part on the allegation that the defendant drug company had violated a federal misbranding prohibition, and was thus presumptively negligent under Ohio law.  <em>Id.,</em> at 806.  The Court assumed that federal law would have to be applied to resolve the claim, but after closely examining the strength of the federal interest at stake and the implications of opening the federal forum, held federal jurisdiction unavailable.  Congress had not provided a private federal cause of action for violation of the federal branding requirement, and the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cit would \xe2\x80\xa6 flout, or at least undermine, congressional intent to conclude that federal courts might nevertheless exercise federal-question jurisdiction and provide remedies for violations of that federal statute solely because the violation \xe2\x80\xa6 is said to be a \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98proximate cause\xe2\x80\x99 under state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 812.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because federal law provides for no quiet title action that could be brought against Darue,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] Grable argues that there can be no federal jurisdiction here, stressing some broad language in <em>Merrell Dow</em> (including the passage just quoted) that on its face supports Grable\xe2\x80\x99s position, see Note, Mr. <em>Smith</em> Goes to Federal Court: Federal Question Jurisdiction over State Law Claims Post-<em>Merrell Dow</em>, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 2272, 2280\xe2\x80\x932282 (2002) (discussing split in Circuit Courts over private right of action requirement after <em>Merrell Dow</em>).  But an opinion is to be read as a whole, and <em>Merrell Dow</em> cannot be read whole as overturning decades of precedent, as it would have done by effectively adopting the Holmes dissent in <em>Smith</em>, see <em>supra,</em> at 5, and converting a federal cause of action from a sufficient condition for federal-question jurisdiction[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] into a necessary one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the first place, <em>Merrell Dow</em> disclaimed the adoption of any bright-line rule, as when the Court reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9cin exploring the outer reaches of \xc2\xa71331, determinations about federal jurisdiction require sensitive judgments about congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U. S., at 810.  The opinion included a lengthy footnote explaining that questions of jurisdiction over state-law claims require \xe2\x80\x9ccareful judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 814, about the \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the federal interest at stake,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 814, n.\xc2\xa012 (emphasis deleted).  And as a final indication that it did not mean to make a federal right of action mandatory, it expressly approved the exercise of jurisdiction sustained in <em>Smith</em>, despite the want of any federal cause of action available to <em>Smith</em>\xe2\x80\x99s shareholder plaintiff.  478 U. S., at 814, n.\xc2\xa012.  <em>Merrell Dow</em> then, did not toss out, but specifically retained the contextual enquiry that had been <em>Smith</em>\xe2\x80\x99s hallmark for over 60 years.  At the end of <em>Merrell Dow</em>, Justice Holmes was still dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, <em>Merrell Dow</em> should be read in its entirety as treating the absence of a federal private right of action as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the \xe2\x80\x9csensitive judgments about congressional intent\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa71331 requires.  The absence of any federal cause of action affected <em>Merrell Dow</em>\xe2\x80\x99s result two ways.  The Court saw the fact as worth some consideration in the assessment of substantiality.  But its primary importance emerged when the Court treated the combination of no federal cause of action and no preemption of state remedies for misbranding as an important clue to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s conception of the scope of jurisdiction to be exercised under \xc2\xa71331.  The Court saw the missing cause of action not as a missing federal door key, always required, but as a missing welcome mat, required in the circumstances, when exercising federal jurisdiction over a state misbranding action would have attracted a horde of original filings and removal cases raising other state claims with embedded federal issues.

A general rule of exercising federal jurisdiction over state claims resting on federal mislabeling and other statutory violations would thus have heralded a potentially enormous shift of traditionally state cases into federal courts.  Expressing concern over the \xe2\x80\x9cincreased volume of federal litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting the importance of adhering to \xe2\x80\x9clegislative intent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Merrell Dow </em>thought it improbable that the Congress, having made no provision for a federal cause of action, would have meant to welcome any state-law tort case implicating federal law \xe2\x80\x9csolely because the violation of the federal statute is said to [create] a rebuttable presumption [of negligence] \xe2\x80\xa6 under state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U.

In this situation, no welcome mat meant keep out.  <em>Merrell Dow</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis thus fits within the framework of examining the importance of having a federal forum for the issue, and the consistency of such a forum with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intended division of labor between state and federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As already indicated, however, a comparable analysis yields a different jurisdictional conclusion in this case.  Although Congress also indicated ambivalence in this case by providing no private right of action to Grable, it is the rare state quiet title action that involves contested issues of federal law, see n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>.  Consequently, jurisdiction over actions like Grable\xe2\x80\x99s would not materially affect, or threaten to affect, the normal currents of litigation.  Given the absence of threatening structural consequences and the clear interest the Government, its buyers, and its delinquents have in the availability of a federal forum, there is no good reason to shirk from federal jurisdiction over the dispositive and contested federal issue at the heart of the state-law title claim.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals, upholding federal jurisdiction over Grable\xe2\x80\x99s quiet title action, is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><right><em>It is so ordered.</em></right></p><em>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we have no occasion to pass upon the proper interpretation of the federal tax provision at issue here.  </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a></casctfnt></em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0Compare Seinfeld</em> v<em>.
