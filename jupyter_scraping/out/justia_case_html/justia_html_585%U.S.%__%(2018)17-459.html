Section 1229(a), in turn, provides that the Government shall serve noncitizens in removal proceedings with a written \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98notice to appear,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d specifying, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).

Reg. 10332, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), at least in recent years, almost always serves noncitizens with notices that fail to specify the time, place, or date of initial removal hearings whenever the agency deems it impracticable to include such information.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has held that such notices trigger the stop-time rule even if they do not specify the time and date of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioner Wescley Fonseca Pereira is a native and citizen of Brazil who came to the United States in 2000 and remained after his visa expired.  Following a 2006 arrest for operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, DHS served Pereira with a document titled \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that did not specify the date and time of his initial removal hearing, instead ordering him to appear at a time and date to be set in the future.  More than a year later, in 2007, the Immigration Court mailed Pereira a more specific notice setting the date and time for his initial hearing, but the notice was sent to the wrong address and was returned as undeliverable.  As a result, Pereira failed to appear, and the Immigration Court ordered him removed in absentia.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2013, Pereira was arrested for a minor motor vehicle violation and detained by DHS.  The Immigration Court reopened the removal proceedings after Pereira demonstrated that he never received the 2007 notice.  Pereira then applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that he had been continuously present in the United States for more than 10 years and that the stop-time rule was not triggered by DHS\xe2\x80\x99 initial 2006 notice because the document lacked information about the time and date of his removal hearing.  The Immigration Court disagreed and ordered Pereira removed.  The BIA agreed with the Immigration Court that the 2006 notice triggered the stop-time rule, even though it failed to specify the time and date of Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s initial removal hearing.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review of the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s order.  Applying the framework set forth in <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i>\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837, it held that the stop-time rule is ambiguous and that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the rule was a permissible reading of the statute.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: A putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceedings is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear under \xc2\xa71229(a),\xe2\x80\x9d and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Court need not resort to <i>Chevron</i> deference, for the unambiguous statutory text alone is enough to resolve this case.  Under the stop-time rule, \xe2\x80\x9cany period of . . . continuous physical presence\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed to end . . . when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1).  By expressly referencing \xc2\xa71229(a), the statute specifies where to look to find out what \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d means.  Section 1229(a), in turn, clarifies that the type of notice \xe2\x80\x9creferred to as a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d throughout the statutory section is a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice . . . specifying,\xe2\x80\x9d as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).  Thus, to trigger the stop-time rule, the Government must serve a notice to appear that, at the very least, \xe2\x80\x9cspecif[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place\xe2\x80\x9d of the removal hearing.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Government and dissent point out that the stop-time rule refers broadly to a notice to appear under \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which includes paragraph (1), as well as paragraphs (2) and (3).  But that does not matter, because only paragraph (1) bears on the meaning of a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  If anything, paragraph (2), which allows for a \xe2\x80\x9cchange or postponement\xe2\x80\x9d of the proceedings to a \xe2\x80\x9cnew time and place,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229(a)(2)(A)(i), bolsters the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute because the provision presumes that the Government has already served a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that specified a time and place as required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).  Another neighboring provision, \xc2\xa71229(b)(1), lends further support for the view that a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d must specify the time and place of removal proceedings to trigger the stop-time rule.  Section 1229(b)(1) gives a noncitizen \xe2\x80\x9cthe opportunity to secure counsel before the first [removal] hearing date\xe2\x80\x9d by mandating that such \xe2\x80\x9chearing date shall not be scheduled earlier than 10 days after the service of the notice to appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  For that provision to have any meaning, the \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d must specify the time and place that the noncitizen, and his counsel, must appear at the removal proceedings.  Finally, common sense reinforces the conclusion that a notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a removal proceeding is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that triggers the stop-time rule.  After all, an essential function of a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d is to provide noncitizens \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d of the information (<i>i.e.</i>, the \xe2\x80\x9ctime\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d) that would enable them \xe2\x80\x9cto appear\xe2\x80\x9d at the removal hearing in the first place.  Without conveying such information, the Government cannot reasonably expect noncitizens to appear for their removal proceedings.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Government and the dissent advance a litany of counterarguments, all of which are unpersuasive.  To begin, the Government mistakenly argues that \xc2\xa71229(a) is not definitional.  That is wrong.  Section 1229(a) speaks in definitional terms, requiring that a notice to appear specify, among other things, the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place at which the proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  As such, the dissent is misguided in arguing that a defective notice to appear, which fails to specify time-and-place information, is still a notice to appear for purposes of the stop-time rule.  Equally unavailing is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s (and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s) attempt to generate ambiguity in the statute based on the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  In light of the plain language and statutory context, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the stop-time rule, clearly means \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caccording to\xe2\x80\x9d because it connects the stop-time trigger in \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1) to a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that specifies the enumerated time-and-place information.  The Government fares no better in arguing that surrounding statutory provisions reinforce its preferred reading of the stop-time rule, as none of those provisions supports its atextual interpretation.  Unable to root its reading in the statutory text, the Government and dissent raise a number of practical concerns, but those concerns are meritless and do not justify departing from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear text.  In a final attempt to salvage its atextual interpretation, the Government turns to the alleged statutory purpose and legislative history of the stop-time rule.  Even for those who consider statutory purpose and legislative history, however, neither supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Requiring the Government to furnish time-and-place information in a notice to appear is entirely consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 stated objective of preventing noncitizens from exploiting administrative delays to accumulate lengthier periods of continuous precedent.

The Immigration Court thereafter attempted to mail Pereira a more specific notice setting the date and time for his initial removal hearing for October 31, 2007, at 9:30 a.m.  But that second notice was sent to Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s street address rather than his post office box (which he had provided to DHS), so it was returned as undeliverable.  Because Pe- reira never received notice of the time and date of his re- moval hearing, he failed to appear, and the Immigration Court ordered him removed in absentia.  Unaware of that re- moval order, Pereira remained in the United States.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, after Pereira had been in the country for more than 10 years, he was arrested for a minor motor vehicle violation (driving without his headlights on) and was subsequently detained by DHS.  The Immigration Court reopened the removal proceedings after Pereira demonstrated that he never received the Immigration Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 notice setting out the specific date and time of his hearing.  Pereira then applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that the stop-time rule was not triggered by DHS\xe2\x80\x99 initial 2006 notice because the document lacked information about the time and date of his removal hearing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Immigration Court disagreed, finding the law \xe2\x80\x9cquite settled that DHS need not put a date certain on the Notice to Appear in order to make that document effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a.  The Immigration Court therefore concluded that Pereira could not meet the 10-year physical-presence requirement under \xc2\xa71229b(b), thereby render- ing him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, and ordered Pereira removed from the country.  The  BIA dismissed Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  Adhering to its precedent in <i>Camarillo</i>,<i> </i>the BIA agreed with the Immigration Court that the 2006 notice triggered the stop-time rule and that Pereira thus failed to satisfy the 10-year physical-presence requirement and was ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review of the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s order.  866 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (2017).

Although the time-and-place information in a notice to appear will vary from case to case, the Government acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]uch of the information Section 1229(a)(1) calls for does not\xe2\x80\x9d change and is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cincluded in standardized language on the I\xe2\x80\x93862 notice-to-appear form.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 36 (referencing 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B), (E)\xe2\x80\x93(F), and (G)(ii)).  In fact, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 notice to Pereira included all of the information required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1), except it failed to specify the date and time of Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceedings.  See App. 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  Accordingly, the dispositive question in this case is much narrower, but no less vital: Does a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that does not specify the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place at which the proceedings will be held,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger the stop-time rule?[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addressing that narrower question, the Court need not resort to <i>Chevron</i> deference, as some lower courts have done, for Congress has supplied a clear and unambiguous answer to the interpretive question at hand.

By expressly referencing \xc2\xa71229(a), the statute specifies where to look to find out what \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d means.  Section 1229(a), in turn, clarifies that the type of notice \xe2\x80\x9creferred to as a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the statutory section is a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. specifying,\xe2\x80\x9d as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).

Section 1229(b)(1) gives a noncitizen \xe2\x80\x9cthe opportunity to secure counsel before the first [removal] hearing date\xe2\x80\x9d by mandating that such \xe2\x80\x9chearing date shall not be scheduled earlier than 10 days after the service of the notice to appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  For \xc2\xa71229(b)(1) to have any meaning, the \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d must specify the time and place that the noncitizen, and his counsel, must appear at the removal hearing.  Otherwise, the Government could serve a document labeled \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d without listing the time and location of the hearing and then, years down the line, provide that information a day before the removal hearing when it becomes available.  Under that view of the statute, a noncitizen theoretically would have had the \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to secure counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d but that opportunity will not be meaningful if, given the absence of a specified time and place, the noncitizen has minimal time and incentive to plan accordingly, and his counsel, in turn, receives limited notice and time to prepare adequately.  It therefore follows that, if a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71229(b)(1) must include the time-and-place information, a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the stop-time rule under \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1) must as well.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taniguchi</i> v. <i>Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.</i>,\n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 560, 571 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, common sense compels the conclusion that a notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a removal proceeding is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d that triggers the stop-time rule.  If the three words \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d mean anything in this context, they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government has to provide noncitizens \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d of the information, <i>i.e., </i>the \xe2\x80\x9ctime\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplace,\xe2\x80\x9d that would enable them \xe2\x80\x9cto appear\xe2\x80\x9d at the removal hearing in the first place.  Conveying such time-and-place information to a noncitizen is an essential function of a notice to appear, for without it, the Government cannot reason- ably expect the noncitizen to appear for his removal proceedings.  To hold otherwise would empower the Government to trigger the stop-time rule merely by sending noncitizens a barebones document labeled \xe2\x80\x9cNotice to Appear,\xe2\x80\x9d with no mention of the time and place of the removal proceedings, even though such documents would do little if anything to facilitate appearance at those proceedings.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We are not willing to impute to Congress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such [a] contradictory and absurd purpose,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bryan</i>,\n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323, 342 (1950), particularly where doing so has no basis in the statutory text.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Straining to inject ambiguity into the statute, the Government and the dissent advance several overlapping arguments.

Brief for Respondent 32.  Section 1229(a), however, does speak in definitional terms, at least with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place at which the proceedings will be held\xe2\x80\x9d: It specifically provides that the notice described under paragraph (1) is \xe2\x80\x9creferred to as a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which in context is quintessential definitional language.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  It then defines that term as a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice\xe2\x80\x9d that, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cspecif[ies] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).  Thus, when the term \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d is used elsewhere in the statutory section, including as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \xc2\xa71229(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Resisting this straightforward understanding of the text, the dissent posits that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71229(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language can be understood to define what makes a notice to appear <i>complete</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 10 (emphasis in original).

The Government essentially argues that phrase 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice required under paragraph (1) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of section 1229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d) and phrase 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cnotice in accordance with paragraph (1) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of section 1229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d) can refer to the same type of notice even though they use entirely different words, but that phrase 3 (\xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear under section 1229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d) cannot refer to that same type of notice because it uses words different from phrases 1 and 2.  But the Government offers no convincing reason why that is so.  The far simpler explanation, and the one that comports with the actual statutory language and context, is that each of these three phrases refers to notice satisfying, at a minimum, the time-and-place criteria defined in \xc2\xa71229(a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Equally unavailing is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of \xc2\xa71229a(b)(7).  Brief for Respondent 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  Under that provision, a noncitizen who is ordered removed in absentia is ineligible for various forms of discretionary relief for a 10-year period if the noncitizen, \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of [Title 8], was provided oral notice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the time and place of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cof the consequences .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d to appear.  \xc2\xa71229a(b)(7).  The Government argues that the express reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe time and place of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71229a(b)(7) shows that, when Congress wants to attach substantive significance to whether a noncitizen is given information about the specific \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place\xe2\x80\x9d of a removal proceeding, it knows exactly how to do so.  Brief for Respondent 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  But even if \xc2\xa71229a(b)(7) may impose harsher consequences on noncitizens who fail to appear at removal proceedings after having specifically received oral<i> </i>notice of the time and place of such proceedings, that reveals nothing about the distinct question here\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>whether Congress intended the stop-time rule to apply when the Government fails to provide written<i> </i>notice of the time and place of removal proceedings.  As to that question, the statute makes clear that Congress fully intended to attach substantive significance to the requirement that noncitizens be given notice of at least the time and place of their removal proceedings.  A document that fails to include such information is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear under section 1229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d and thus does not trigger the stop-time rule.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"> Unable to find sure footing in the statutory text, the Government and the dissent pivot away from the plain language and raise a number of practical concerns.  These practical considerations are meritless and do not justify departing from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear text.  See <i>Burrage</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n571 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204, 218 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government, for its part, argues that the \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative realities of removal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d render it difficult to guarantee each noncitizen a specific time, date, and place for his removal proceedings.  See Brief for Respondent 48.  That contention rests on the misguided premise that the time-and-place information specified in the notice to appear must be etched in stone.  That is incorrect.  As noted above, \xc2\xa71229(a)(2) expressly vests the Government with power to change the time or place of a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceedings so long as it provides \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. specifying .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the new time or place of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d and the consequences of failing to appear.  See \xc2\xa71229(a)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 16\xe2\x80\x9319.  Nothing in our decision today inhibits the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exercise that statu- tory authority after it has served a notice to appear specify- ing the time and place of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent raises a similar practical concern, which is similarly misplaced.  The dissent worries that requiring the Government to specify the time and place of removal proceedings, while allowing the Government to change that information, might encourage DHS to provide \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary dates and times that are likely to confuse and confound all who receive them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 8.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument wrongly assumes that the Government is ut- terly incapable of specifying an accurate date and time on a notice to appear and will instead engage in \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary\xe2\x80\x9d behavior.  See <i>ibid.</i>  The Court does not embrace those unsupported assumptions.  As the Government concedes, \xe2\x80\x9ca scheduling system previously enabled DHS and the immigration court to coordinate in setting hearing dates in some cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 50, n.\xc2\xa015; Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>30\xe2\x80\x9331.  Given today\xe2\x80\x99s advanced software capabilities, it is hard to imagine why DHS and immigration courts could not again work together to schedule hearings before sending notices to appear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s related contention that including a changeable date would \xe2\x80\x9cmislead\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice\xe2\x80\x9d noncitizens is unfounded.  <i>Post, </i>at 8. <i> </i>As already explained, if the Government changes the date of the removal proceedings, it must provide written notice to the noncitizen, \xc2\xa71229(a)(2).  This notice requirement mitigates any potential confusion that may arise from altering the hearing date.  In reality, it is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute that would \xe2\x80\x9cconfuse and confound\xe2\x80\x9d noncitizens, <i>post,</i> at 8, by authorizing the Government to serve notices that lack any information about the time and place of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In a last ditch effort to salvage its atextual interpretation, the Government invokes the alleged purpose and legislative history of the stop-time rule.  Brief for Respondent 37\xe2\x80\x9340.  Even for those who consider statutory purpose and legislative history, however, neither supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s atextual position that Congress intended the stop-time rule to apply when a noncitizen has been deprived notice of the time and place of his removal proceedings.  By the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own account, Congress enacted the stop-time rule to prevent noncitizens from exploiting administrative delays to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy time\xe2\x80\x9d during which they accumulate periods of continuous presence.  <i>Id.,</i> at 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (citing H.\xc2\xa0R.

Requiring the Government to furnish time-and-place information in a notice to appear, however, is en- tirely consistent with that objective because, once a proper notice to appear is served, the stop-time rule is triggered, and a noncitizen would be unable to manipulate or delay removal proceedings to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy time.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the end of the day, given the clarity of the plain language, we \xe2\x80\x9capply the statute as it is written.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burrage</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cnoncitizen\xe2\x80\x9d throughout this opinion to refer to any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

Dec. 644 (2011).  After that administrative ruling, in addition to the decision under review here, at least six Courts of Appeals, citing <i>Chevron</i>, concluded that \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1) was ambiguous and then held that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation was reasonable.

Under that decision, if a federal statute is ambiguous and the agency that is authorized to implement it offers a reasonable interpretation, then a court is supposed to accept that interpretation.  Here, a straightforward application of <i>Chevron</i> requires us to accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the provision at issue.  But the Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation in favor of one that it regards as the best reading of the statute.  I can only conclude that the Court, for whatever reason, is simply ignoring <i>Chevron</i>.</p><p>I</p><p>As amended, the Immigration and Nationality Act generally requires the Government to remove nonpermanent resident aliens who overstay the terms of their admission into this country.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71227(a)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C).  But under certain circumstances, the Government may decide to cancel their removal instead.  See \xc2\xa71229b.  To be eligible for such relief, an alien must demonstrate that he or she \xe2\x80\x9chas been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(b)(1)(A).  \xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d that rule, however, \xe2\x80\x9cany period of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1).  That language acts as a stop-time rule, preventing the continuous-presence clock from continuing to run once an alien is served with a notice to appear.</p><p>The question presented by this case is whether the stop-time rule is triggered by service of a notice to appear that is incomplete in some way.  A provision of the amended Immigration and Nationality Act requires that the Government serve an alien who it seeks to remove with a notice to appear \xe2\x80\x9cspecifying\xe2\x80\x9d a list of things, including \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he nature of the proceedings against the alien,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legal authority under which the proceedings are conducted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he charges against the alien and the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated,\xe2\x80\x9d and (what is relevant here) \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (G)(i).</p><p>Petitioner Wescley Pereira is a Brazilian citizen who entered the United States lawfully in 2000 but then illegally overstayed his nonimmigrant visa.  In 2006, the Government caused him to be served in person with a document styled as a notice to appear for removal proceedings.  Pereira concedes that he overstayed his visa and is thus removable, but he argues that he is nonetheless eligible for cancellation of removal because he has now been in the country continuously for more than 10 years.  He contends that the notice served on him in 2006 did not qualify as a notice to appear because it lacked one piece of information that such a notice is supposed to contain, namely, the time at which his removal proceedings were to be held.  Thus, Pereira contends, that notice did not trigger the stop-time rule, and the clock continued to run.</p><p>The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has rejected this interpretation of the stop-time rule in the past.  It has held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n equally plausible reading\xe2\x80\x9d is that the stop-time rule \xe2\x80\x9cmerely specifies the document the [Government] must serve on the alien to trigger the \xe2\x80\x98stop-time\xe2\x80\x99 rule and does not impose substantive requirements for a notice to appear to be effective in order for that trigger to occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Camarillo</i>, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 644, 647 (2011).  It therefore held in this case that Pereira is ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>Pereira, on one side, and the Government and the BIA, on the other, have a quasi-metaphysical disagreement about the meaning of the concept of a notice to appear.  Is a notice to appear a document that contains certain essential characteristics, namely, all the information required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1), so that any notice that omits any of that information is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d at all?  Or is a notice to appear a document that is conventionally called by that name, so that a notice that omits some of the information required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) may still be regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d?</p><p>Picking the better of these two interpretations might have been a challenge in the first instance.  But the Court did not need to decide that question, for under <i>Chevron</i> we are obligated to defer to a Government agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute that it administers so long as that interpretation is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98permissible\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d one.  <i>INS</i> v. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre</i>,526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415, 424 (1999).  All that is required is that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d; it need not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe only possible interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed <i>most</i> reasonable by the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Entergy Corp.</i> v. <i>Riverkeeper, Inc.</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 208, 218 (2009).  Moreover, deference to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cis especially appropriate in the immigration context\xe2\x80\x9d because of the potential foreign-policy implications.  <i>Aguirre-Aguirre</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 425.  In light of the relevant text, context, statutory history, and statutory purpose, there is no doubt that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the stop-time rule is indeed permissible under <i>Chevron</i>.</p><p>B</p><p>By its terms, the stop-time rule is consistent with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  As noted, the stop-time rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany period of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1).  A degree of ambiguity arises from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder,\xe2\x80\x9d for as the Court recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is [a] chameleon,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 15, having \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98many dictionary definitions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and no \xe2\x80\x9cuniform, consistent meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Kirtsaeng</i> v. <i>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</i>,568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519, 531 (2013).  Everyone agrees, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is often used to mean \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New World College Dictionary 1453 (3d ed. 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cauthorized .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by\xe2\x80\x9d); American Heritage Dictionary 1945 (3d ed. 1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cWith the authorization of\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Respondent 24 (agreeing that \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9csubject to,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned by,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cissued under the authority of\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioner 28.  And when the term is used in this way, it does not necessarily mean that the act done pursuant to that authorization was done in strict compliance with the terms of the authorization.  For example, one might refer to a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 26(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure even if that disclosure did not comply with Rule 26(a) in every respect.  Or one might refer to regulations promulgated \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d a statute even if a court later found those regulations inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p><p>That use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d perfectly fits the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the stop-time rule.  The Government served Pereira with a notice to appear \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71229(a) in the sense that the notice was \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by\xe2\x80\x9d that provision, which states that a notice to appear \xe2\x80\x9cshall be given\xe2\x80\x9d to an alien in a removal proceeding and outlines several rules governing such notices.  On that reasonable reading, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1229(a)\xe2\x80\x9d acts as shorthand for the type of document governed by \xc2\xa71229(a).</p><p>C</p><p>That interpretation is bolstered by the stop-time rule\xe2\x80\x99s cross-reference to \xe2\x80\x9csection 1229(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1).  Pereira interprets that cross-reference as picking up every substantive requirement that applies to notices to appear.  But those substantive requirements are found only in \xc2\xa71229(a)<i>(1)</i>.  Thus, the cross-reference to \xe2\x80\x9csection 1229(a),\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9csection 1229(a)(1),\xe2\x80\x9d tends to undermine Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, because if Congress had meant for the stop-time rule to incorporate the substantive requirements located in \xc2\xa71229(a)(1), it presumably would have referred specifically to that provision and not more generally to \xe2\x80\x9csection 1229(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  We normally presume that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Congress want[s] to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph, it [says] so,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>NLRB</i> v. <i>SW General, Inc.</i>, 580 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9), and it is instructive that neighboring statutory provisions in this case are absolutely riddled with such specific cross-references.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  In the stop-time rule, however, Congress chose to insert a broader cross-reference, one that refers to the general process of serving notices to appear as a whole.  See \xc2\xa71229(a).  Thus, Pereira essentially \xe2\x80\x9cwants to cherry pick from the material covered by the statutory cross-reference.  But if Congress had intended to refer to the definition in [\xc2\xa71229(a)(1)] alone, it presumably would have done so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cyan, Inc.</i> v. <i>Beaver County Employees Retirement Fund</i>, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9).[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>D</p><p>Statutory history also strongly supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a notice to appear should trigger the stop-time rule even if it fails to include the date and time of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal proceeding.  When Congress enacted the stop-time rule, it decreed that the rule should \xe2\x80\x9capply to notices to appear issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \xc2\xa7309(c)(5),110Stat.3009\xe2\x80\x93627.  This created a problem: Up until that point, there was no such thing as a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear,\xe2\x80\x9d so the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnotices to appear issued before .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. this Act\xe2\x80\x9d made little sense.  When Congress became aware of the problem, it responded by clarifying that the stop-time rule should apply not only to notices to appear, but also \xe2\x80\x9cto orders to show cause .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. issued before, on, or after the date\xe2\x80\x9d of the clarifying amendment\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, \xc2\xa7203(1),111Stat.2196, as amended8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 note.  That clarification sheds considerable light on the question presented here because orders to show cause did not necessarily include the date or location of proceedings (even if they otherwise served a function similar to that now served by notices to appear).  See8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252b(a)(2)(A) (1994 ed.).</p><p>That statutory history supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation twice over.  First, it demonstrates that when it comes to triggering the stop-time rule, Congress attached no particular significance to the presence (or absence) of information about the date and time of a removal proceeding.  Congress was more than happy for the stop-time rule to be activated either by notices to appear or by orders to show cause, even though the latter often lacked any information about the date and time of proceedings.</p><p>Second, and even more important, the statutory history also shows that Congress clearly thought of orders to show cause as the functional equivalent of notices to appear for purposes of the stop-time rule.  After an initially confusing reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnotices to appear\xe2\x80\x9d issued before the creation of the stop-time rule, Congress clarified that it had meant to refer to \xe2\x80\x9corders to show cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  By equating orders to show cause with notices to appear, Congress indicated that when the stop-time rule refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca notice to appear,\xe2\x80\x9d it is referring to a category of documents that do not necessarily provide the date and time of a future removal proceeding.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>E</p><p>Finally, Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation leads to consequences that clash with any conceivable statutory purpose.  Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would require the Government to include a date and time on every notice to appear that it issues.  But at the moment, the Government lacks the ability to do that with any degree of accuracy.  The Department of Homeland Security sends out the initial notice to appear, but the removal proceedings themselves are scheduled by the Immigration Court, which is part of the Department of Justice.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.18(a) (2018).  The Department of Homeland Security cannot dictate the scheduling of a matter on the docket of the Immigration Court, and at present, the Department of Homeland Security generally cannot even access the Immigration Court\xe2\x80\x99s calendar.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Camarillo</i>, 25 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 648; Tr. of Oral Arg. 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  The Department of Homeland Security may thus be hard pressed to include on initial notices to appear a hearing date that is anything more than a rough estimate subject to considerable change.  See \xc2\xa71229(a)(2); see also <i>ante</i>, at 18 (disclaiming any effect on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to change initial hearing dates).</p><p>Including an estimated and changeable date, however, may do much more harm than good.  See <i>Gonzalez-Garcia </i>v.<i> Holder</i>, 770 F. 3d 431, 434\xe2\x80\x93435 (CA6 2014).  It is likely to mislead many recipients and to prejudice those who make preparations on the assumption that the initial date is firm.  And it forces the Government to go through the pointless exercise of first including a date that it knows may very well be altered and then changing it once the real date becomes clear.  Such a system serves nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interests.</p><p>Statutory interpretation is meant to be \xe2\x80\x9ca holistic endeavor,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes language \xe2\x80\x9cthat may seem ambiguous in isolation\xe2\x80\x9d becomes clear because \xe2\x80\x9conly one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United Sav. Assn. of Tex.</i> v. <i>Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.</i>,484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365, 371 (1988).  The real-world effects produced by Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation\xe2\x80\x94arbitrary dates and times that are likely to confuse and confound all who receive them\xe2\x80\x94illustrate starkly the merits of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative construction.</p><p>III</p><p>Based on the relevant text, context, statutory history, and statutory purpose, the Government makes a convincing case that the stop-time rule can be triggered even by a notice to appear that omits the date and time of a removal proceeding.  But the Court holds instead that in order \xe2\x80\x9cto trigger the stop-time rule, the Government must serve a notice to appear that, at the very least, \xe2\x80\x98specif[ies]\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98time and place\xe2\x80\x99 of the removal proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  According to the Court, that conclusion is compelled by the statutory text, the statutory context, and \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12.  While the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation may be reasonable, the Court goes much too far in saying that it is the <i>only</i> reasonable construction.</p><p>A</p><p>Start with the text.  As noted, the stop-time rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9cany period of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229b(d)(1).  The Court does not dispute that it is entirely consistent with standard English usage to read this language as the Government and I do.  See <i>ante</i>, at 15.  It therefore follows that the stop-time rule itself does not foreclose the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p><p>That leaves only \xc2\xa71229(a)(1), which specifies the information that a notice to appear must contain.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of this provision contradicts itself.  On the one hand, the Court insists that this provision is \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitional\xe2\x80\x9d and that it sets out the essential characteristics without which a notice is not a notice to appear.  <i>Ante</i>, at 13.  But on the other hand, the Court states that it \xe2\x80\x9cleaves for another day whether a putative notice to appear that omits any of the other categories of information enumer- ated in \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) triggers the stop-time rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa05.  The Court cannot have it both ways.  If \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) is definitional and sets out the essential characteristics of a notice to appear, then the omission of any required item of information makes a putative notice to appear a nullity.  So if the Court means what it says\xe2\x80\x94that its interpretation of \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language leaves open the consequences of omitting other categories of information\xe2\x80\x94that is tantamount to admitting that \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) itself cannot foreclose the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>In any event, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation can easily be squared with the text of \xc2\xa71229(a)(1).  That provision states that a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice (<i>in this section referred to as a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear\xe2\x80\x99</i>) shall be given in person to the alien .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. specifying\xe2\x80\x9d 10 categories of information, including the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place\xe2\x80\x9d of the removal proceeding.  \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) (emphasis added).  According to Pereira, that language cinches the case against the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation: By equating a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten notice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [that] specif[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant categories of information, \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) establishes that a notice lacking any of those 10 pieces of information cannot qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear\xe2\x80\x9d and thus cannot trigger the stop-time rule.  In Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) defines what a notice to appear is, and most of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is to the same effect.</p><p>This may be a plausible interpretation of \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language, but it is not the only one.  It is at least as reasonable to read that language as simply giving a name to the new type of notice to which that provision refers.  Or to put the point another way, \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language can be understood to define what makes a notice to appear <i>complete</i>.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re Camarillo</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 647.  Under that interpretation, a notice that omits some of the information required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) might still be a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice to appear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>We often use language in this way.  In everyday life, a person who sees an old Chevy with three wheels in a junkyard would still call it a car.  Language is often used the same way in the law.  Consider the example of a notice of appeal.  Much like a notice to appear, a notice of appeal must meet several substantive requirements; all notices of appeal, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be signed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a).  So what happens if a notice of appeal is incomplete in some way\xe2\x80\x94say, because it is unsigned but otherwise impeccable?  If a court clerk wanted to point out the lack of a signature to an attorney, the clerk is far more likely to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a problem with your notice of appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d than to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a problem with this document you filed; it\xe2\x80\x99s not signed and therefore I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t call it a notice of appeal because it is unsigned.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Furthermore, just because a legal document is incomplete, it does not necessarily follow that it is without legal effect.  Consider again the notice of appeal.  As a general matter, an appeal \xe2\x80\x9cmay be taken\xe2\x80\x9d in a civil case \xe2\x80\x9conly by filing a notice of appeal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3(a), 4(a)(1)(A).  While an unsigned notice of appeal does not meet the substantive requirements set out in Rule 11, in <i>Becker</i> v. <i>Montgomery</i>,532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 757, 763, 768 (2001), this Court unanimously held that a litigant who filed a timely but unsigned notice of appeal still beat the 30-day clock for filing appeals.  As we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cimperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 767.</p><p>If Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure can be read in this way, it is not unreasonable to do the same with \xc2\xa71229(a)(1).  And in trying to distinguish an empty signature line on a notice of appeal as a \xe2\x80\x9ctrivial, ministe- rial defect,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 14, the Court gives the game away by once again assuming its own conclusion.  Whether the omission of the date and time certain on a notice to appear is essential for present purposes is the central issue in this case, and the Court gives no textually based reason to think that it is.  The Government could reasonably conclude that a notice to appear that omits the date and time of a proceeding is still a notice to appear (albeit a defective one), much in the same way that a complaint without the e-mail address of the signer is still a complaint (albeit a defective one, see Rule 11(a)), or a clock missing the number \xe2\x80\x9c8\xe2\x80\x9d is still a clock (albeit a defective one).</p><p>Pereira and the Court are right that \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) sets out the substantive requirements for notices to appear, but that fact alone does not control whether an incomplete notice to appear triggers the stop-time rule.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p><p>B</p><p>With the text of both the stop-time rule and \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) irreducibly ambiguous, the Court must next look to two neighboring provisions to support its conclusion that its interpretation is the only reasonable one.  Neither provision is sufficient.</p><p>The Court first observes that the second paragraph of \xc2\xa71229(a) allows the Government to move or reschedule a removal proceeding unilaterally and then to inform the alien of \xe2\x80\x9cthe new time or place of the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71229(a)(2)(A)(i).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy allowing for a \xe2\x80\x98change or postponement\xe2\x80\x99 of the proceedings to a \xe2\x80\x98new time or place,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reasons, \xe2\x80\x9cparagraph (2) presumes that the Government has already served a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99 that specified a time and place as required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.</p><p>That is entirely correct\xe2\x80\x94and entirely irrelevant.  No one doubts that \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) requires that a notice to appear include the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place\xe2\x80\x9d of the removal proceeding.  See \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(G)(i).  Indeed, that is common ground between the two parties.  See Brief for Petitioner 10\xe2\x80\x9311; Brief for Respondent 3.  Paragraph (2) undoubtedly assumes that notices to appear will state the \xe2\x80\x9ctime and place\xe2\x80\x9d of the removal proceeding as required by \xc2\xa71229(a)(1), but it has nothing to say about whether the failure to include that information affects the operation of the stop-time rule.  By suggesting otherwise, the Court is merely reasoning backwards from its conclusion.</p><p>The other provision cited by the Court, \xc2\xa71229(b)(1), is no more helpful.  As the Court explains, \xc2\xa71229(b)(1) generally precludes the Government from scheduling a hearing date \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98earlier than 10 days after the service of the notice to appear\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in order to give the alien \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the opportunity to secure counsel.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  Unless a notice to appear includes the time and place of the hearing, the Court frets, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government could serve a document labeled \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear\xe2\x80\x99 without listing the time and location of the hearing and then, years down the line, provide that information a day before the removal hearing when it becomes available.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  But that remote and speculative possibility depends entirely on the Immigration Court\xe2\x80\x99s allowing a removal proceeding to go forward only one day after an alien (and the Government) receives word of a hearing date.  See 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.18(a).  Even assuming that such an unlikely event were to come to pass, the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision would surely be subject to review on appeal.  See generally 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.1,8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252.  Regardless, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the stop-time rule would not prevent a similar type of problem from arising.  When the Government sends an initial notice to appear from now on, it may be forced by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation to guess that the hearing will take place far in the future, only to learn shortly afterwards that the hearing is in fact imminent.  An alien lulled into a false sense of security by that initial notice to appear will have as little meaningful \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98opportun- ity to secure counsel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctime to prepare adequately,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 11, as one who initially received a notice to appear without any hearing date.</p><p>C</p><p>Finally, the Court turns to \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d to support its preferred reading of the text.  According to the Court, it should be \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d to anyone that \xe2\x80\x9ca notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a removal proceeding is not a \xe2\x80\x98notice to appear.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 2, 12.  But what the Court finds so obvious somehow managed to elude every Court of Appeals to consider the question save one.  See <i>Moscoso-Castellanos</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 1079, 1083 (CA9 2015); <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Garro</i> v. <i>U.\xc2\xa0S. Attorney General</i>, 605 Fed. Appx. 951, 953 (CA11 2015) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Guaman-Yuqui</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 786 F.\xc2\xa03d 235, 240 (CA2 2015) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Gonzalez-Garcia</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 770 F.\xc2\xa03d 431, 434\xe2\x80\x93435 (CA6 2014); <i>Yi Di Wang</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 759 F.\xc2\xa03d 670, 675 (CA7 2014); <i>Urbina</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, 745 F.\xc2\xa03d 736, 740 (CA4 2014).</p><p>That is likely because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d depends on a very specific understanding of the purpose of a notice to appear.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, notices to appear serve primarily as a vehicle for communicating to aliens when and where they should appear for their removal hearings.  That is certainly a reasonable interpretation with some intuitive force behind it.  But that is not the only possible understanding or even necessarily the best one.  As the Government reasonably explains, a notice to appear can also be understood to serve primarily as a charging document.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 39\xe2\x80\x9345.  Indeed, much of \xc2\xa71229(a)(1) reinforces that view through the informational requirements it imposes on notices to appear.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9cnature of the proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9clegal authority\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cthe proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(C) (\xe2\x80\x9cacts or conduct alleged\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71229(a)(1)(D) (\xe2\x80\x9ccharges against the alien\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cstatutory provisions alleged to have been violated\xe2\x80\x9d).  Interpreted in this way, a notice to appear hardly runs afoul of \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d by simply omitting the date and time of a future removal proceeding.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision appears even less commonsensical once its likely consequences are taken into account.  As already noted, going forward the Government will be forced to include an arbitrary date and time on every notice to appear that it issues.  See <i>supra</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Such a system will only serve to confuse everyone involved, and the Court offers no explanation as to why it believes otherwise.  Although the Court expresses surprise at the idea that its opinion will \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98forc[e] the Government\xe2\x80\x99 to guess when and where a hearing will take place,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06, it is undisputed that the Government currently lacks the capability to do anything other than speculate about the likely date and time of future removal proceedings.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9349, 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  At most, we can hope that the Government develops a system in the coming years that allows it to determine likely dates and times before it sends out initial notices to appear.  But nothing in either today\xe2\x80\x99s decision or the statute can guarantee such an outcome, so the Court is left crossing its fingers and hoping for the best.  <i>Ante</i>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06, 18\xe2\x80\x9319.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>Once the errors and false leads are stripped away, the most that remains of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is a textually permissible interpretation consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view of \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not enough to show that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contrary interpretation is unreasonable.  Choosing between these competing interpretations might have been difficult in the first instance.  But under <i>Chevron</i>, that choice was not ours to make.  Under <i>Chevron</i>, this Court was obliged to defer to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.</p><p>In recent years, several Members of this Court have questioned <i>Chevron</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>foundations.<i> </i>See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Kennedy, J., concurring);<i> Michigan</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x935); <i>Gutierrez-Brizuela</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 834 F.\xc2\xa03d 1142, 1149 (CA10 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).

Second, the Court also observes misleadingly that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason why a notice to appear should have only one essential function,\xe2\x80\x9d and that a notice to appear might thus serve the dual purpose of both presenting charges and informing an alien \xe2\x80\x9cwhen and where to appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Of course it might, but it is also equally reasonable to interpret a notice to appear as serving only one of those functions.
