JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case involves the validity of copyrights obtained by respondents for statuettes of male and female dancing figures made of semivitreous china.  The controversy centers around the fact that, although copyrighted as "works of art," the statuettes were intended for use and used as bases for table lamps, with electric wiring, sockets, and lamp shades attached.</p>\n<p>Respondents are partners in the manufacture and sale of electric lamps.  One of the respondents created original works of sculpture in the form of human figures by traditional clay-model technique.  From this model, a production mold for casting copies was made.  The resulting statuettes, without any lamp components added, were submitted by the respondents to the Copyright Office for registration as "works of art" or reproductions thereof under \xc2\xa7 5(g) or \xc2\xa7 5(h) of the copyright law, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and certificates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 347 U. S. 203</a></p><p> of registration issued.  Sales (publication in accordance with the statute) as fully equipped lamps preceded the applications for copyright registration of the statuettes.  17 U.S.C. (Supp. V, 1952) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 10, 11, 13, 209; Rules and Regulations, 37 CFR, 1949, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 202.8 and 202.9.  Thereafter, the statuettes were sold in quantity throughout the country both as lamp bases and as statuettes.  The sales in lamp form accounted for all but an insignificant portion of respondents\' sales.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are partners, and, like respondents, make and sell lamps.  Without authorization, they copied the statuettes, embodied them in lamps, and sold them.</p>\n<p>The instant case is one in a series of reported suits brought by respondents against various alleged infringers of the copyrights, all presenting the same or a similar question. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Because of conflicting decisions, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] we granted certiorari.  346 U.S. 811.  In the present case, respondents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 347 U. S. 204</a></p><p> sued petitioners for infringement in Maryland.  <em>Stein v. Mazer,</em> 111 F.Supp. 359.  Following the Expert decision and rejecting the reasoning of the District Court in the <em>Rosenthal</em> opinion, both referred to in the preceding note, the District Court dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and held the copyrights valid.  <em>Stein v. Mazer,</em> 204 F.2d 472. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It said:</p>\n<p>"A subsequent utilization of a work of art in an article of manufacture in no way affects the right of the copyright owner to be protected against infringement of the work of art itself."</p>\n<p>204 F.2d at 477.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, charged by the present complaint with infringement of respondents\' copyrights of reproductions of their works of art, seek here a reversal of the Court of Appeals decree upholding the copyrights.  Petitioners, in their petition for certiorari, present a single question:</p>\n<p>"Can statuettes be protected in the United States by copyright when the copyright applicant intended primarily to use the statuettes in the form of lamp </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 347 U. S. 205</a></p><p> bases to be made and sold in quantity and carried the intentions into effect?"</p>\n<p>"Stripped down to its essentials, the question presented is:  can a lamp manufacturer copyright his lamp bases?"</p>\n<p>The first paragraph accurately summarizes the issue.  The last gives it a quirk that unjustifiably, we think, broadens the controversy.  The case requires an answer not as to a manufacturer\'s right to register a lamp base, but as to an artist\'s right to copyright a work of art intended to be reproduced for lamp bases.  As petitioners say in their brief, their contention "questions the validity of the copyright based upon the actions of respondents."  Petitioners question the validity of a copyright of a work of art for "mass" production.  "Reproduction of a work of art" does not mean to them unlimited reproduction.  Their position is that a copyright does not cover industrial reproduction of the protected article.  Thus, their reply brief states:</p>\n<p>"When an artist becomes a manufacturer or a designer for a manufacturer, he is subject to the limitations of design patents, and deserves no more consideration than any other manufacturer or designer."</p>\n<p>It is not the right to copyright an article that could have utility under \xc2\xa7 5(g) and (h),  <a href="#F1" name="T1">note 1</a> <em>supra,</em> that petitioners oppose.  Their brief accepts the copyrightability of the great carved golden salt cellar of Cellini, but adds:</p>\n<p>"If, however, Cellini designed and manufactured this item in quantity so that the general public could have salt cellars, then an entirely different conclusion would be reached.  In such case, the salt cellar becomes an article of manufacture having utility in addition to its ornamental value, and would therefore have to be protected by design patent. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 347 U. S. 206</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is publication as a lamp and registration as a statue to gain a monopoly in manufacture that they assert is such a misuse of copyright as to make the registration invalid.</p>\n<p>No unfair competition question is presented.  The constitutional power of Congress to confer copyright protection on works of art or their reproductions is not questioned. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Petitioners assume, as Congress has in its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 347 U. S. 207</a></p><p> enactments and, as do we, that the constitutional clause empowering legislation</p>\n<p>"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 347 U. S. 208</a></p><p> respective Writings and Discoveries,"</p>\n<p>Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 8, includes within the term "Authors" the creator of a picture or a statue.  The Court\'s consideration will be limited to the question presented by the petition for the writ of certiorari. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In recent years, the question as to utilitarian use of copyrighted articles has been much discussed. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>In answering that issue, a review of the development of copyright coverage will make clear the purpose of the Congress in its copyright legislation.  In 1790 the First Congress conferred a copyright on "authors of any map, chart, book or books already printed." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Later, designing, engraving and etching were included; [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] in 1831, musical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 347 U. S. 209</a></p><p> composition; [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] dramatic compositions in 1856; [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and photographs and negatives thereof in 1865. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Act of 1870 defined copyrightable subject matter as:</p>\n<p>". . . any book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph or negative thereof, or of a painting, drawing, chromo, <em>statute, statuary, and of models or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine arts.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.) [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The italicized part added three-dimensional work of art to what had been protected previously. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In 1909, Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 347 U. S. 210</a></p><p> again enlarged the scope of the copyright statute. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The new Act provided in \xc2\xa7 4:</p>\n<p>"That the works for which copyright may be secured under this Act shall include all the writings of an author. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]"</p>\n<p>Some writers interpret this section as being coextensive with the constitutional grant, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] but the House Report, while inconclusive, indicates that it was "declaratory of existing law" only. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Section 5 relating to classes of writings in 1909 read as shown in the margin with subsequent additions not material to this decision. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 347 U. S. 211</a></p><p> Significant for our purposes was the deletion of the fine arts clause of the 1870 Act. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Verbal distinctions between purely aesthetic articles and useful works of art ended insofar as the statutory copyright language is concerned. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The practice of the Copyright Office, under the 1870 and 1874 Acts and before the 1909 Act, was to allow registration "as works of the fine arts" of articles of the same character as those of respondents now under challenge.  Seven examples appear in the Government\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="212">Page 347 U. S. 212</a></p><p> brief amicus curiae. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In 1910, interpreting the 1909 Act, the pertinent Copyright Regulations read as shown in the margin. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Because, as explained by the Government, this regulation "made no reference to articles which might fairly be considered works of art although they might also serve a useful purpose," it was reworded in 1917 as shown below. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The <em>amicus</em> brief gives sixty examples selected at five-year intervals, 1912-1952, said to be typical of registrations of works of art possessing utilitarian aspects. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The current pertinent regulation, published in 37 CFR, 1949, \xc2\xa7 202.8, reads thus:</p>\n<p>"<em>Works of art (Class G) -- (a) In General.</em>  This class includes works of artistic craftsmanship, in so far as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned, such as artistic jewelry, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="213">Page 347 U. S. 213</a></p><p> enamels, glassware, and tapestries, as well as all works belonging to the fine arts, such as paintings, drawings and sculpture. . . ."</p>\n<p>So we have a contemporaneous and long continued construction of the statutes by the agency charged to administer them that would allow the registration of such a statuette as is in question here. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court once essayed to fix the limits of the fine arts. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  That effort need not be appraised in relation to this copyright issue.  It is clear Congress intended the scope of the copyright statute to include more than the traditional fine arts.  Herbert Putnam, Esq., then Librarian of Congress and active in the movement to amend the copyright laws, told the joint meeting of the House and Senate Committees:</p>\n<p>"The term \'works of art\' is deliberately intended as a broader specification than \'works of the fine arts\' in the present statute with the idea that there is subject matter (for instance, of applied design, not yet within the province of design patents), which may properly be entitled to protection under the copyright law. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]"</p>\n<p>The successive acts, the legislative history of the 1909 Act and the practice of the Copyright Office unite to show </p><p><a class="page-number" name="214">Page 347 U. S. 214</a></p><p> that "works of art" and "reproductions of works of art" are terms that were intended by Congress to include the authority to copyright these statuettes.  Individual perception of the beautiful is too varied a power to permit a narrow or rigid concept of art.  As a standard, we can hardly do better than the words of the present Regulation, \xc2\xa7 202.8, <em>supra,</em> naming the things that appertain to the arts.  They must be original, that is, the author\'s tangible expression of his ideas.  <em>Compare Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/53/case.html">111 U. S. 53</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/53/case.html#59">111 U. S. 59</a></span>-60.  Such expression, whether meticulously delineating the model or mental image or conveying the meaning by modernistic form or color, is copyrightable. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  What cases there are confirm this coverage of the statute. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>The conclusion that the statues here in issue may be copyrighted goes far to solve the question whether their intended reproduction as lamp stands bars or invalidates their registration.  This depends solely on statutory interpretation.  Congress may, after publication, protect by copyright any writing of an author.  Its statute creates the copyright. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  It did not exist at common law even </p><p><a class="page-number" name="215">Page 347 U. S. 215</a></p><p> though he had a property right in his unpublished work. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>But petitioners assert that congressional enactment of the design patent laws should be interpreted as denying protection to artistic articles embodied or reproduced in manufactured articles. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  They say:</p>\n<p>"Fundamentally and historically, the Copyright Office is the repository of what each claimant considers to be a cultural treasure, whereas the Patent Office is the repository of what each applicant considers to be evidence of the advance in industrial and technological fields."</p>\n<p>Their argument is that design patents require the critical examination given patents to protect the public against monopoly.  Attention is called to <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/81/511/case.html">Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White,</a></span></em> 14 Wall. 511, interpreting the design patent law of 1842, 5 Stat. 544, granting a patent to anyone who by "their own industry, genius, efforts, and expense, may have invented or produced any new and original design for a manufacture. . . ."  A pattern for flat silver was there upheld. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  The intermediate and present law differs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 347 U. S. 216</a></p><p> little.  "Whoever invents any new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture may obtain a patent therefor, . . . " subject generally to the provisions concerning patents for invention.  \xc2\xa7 171, 66 Stat. 805.  As petitioner sees the effect of the design patent law:</p>\n<p>"If an industrial designer can not satisfy the novelty requirements of the design patent laws, then his design as used on articles of manufacture can be copied by anyone."</p>\n<p>Petitioner has furnished the Court a booklet of numerous design patents for statuettes, bases for table lamps and similar articles for manufacture, quite indistinguishable in type from the copyrighted statuettes here in issue. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Petitioner urges that overlapping of patent and copyright legislation so as to give an author or inventor a choice between patents and copyrights should not be permitted.  We assume petitioner takes the position that protection for a statuette for industrial use can only be obtained by patent, if any protection can be given. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 347 U. S. 217</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As we have held the statuettes here involved copyrightable, we need not decide the question of their patentability.  Though other courts have passed upon the issue as to whether allowance by the election of the author or patentee of one bars a grant of the other, we do not. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  We do hold that the patentability of the statuettes, fitted as lamps or unfitted, does not bar copyright as works of art.  Neither the Copyright Statute nor any other says that, because a thing is patentable, it may not be copyrighted.  We should not so hold. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p>Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea -- not the idea itself. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Thus, in <em>Baker v. Selden,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/99/case.html">101 U. S. 99</a></span>, the Court held that a copyrighted book on a peculiar system of bookkeeping was not infringed by a similar book using a similar plan which achieved similar results where the alleged infringer made a different arrangement of the columns and used different headings.  The distinction is illustrated in <em>Fred Fisher, Inc. v. Dillingham,</em> 298 F. 145, 151, when the court speaks of two men, each a perfectionist, independently making </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 347 U. S. 218</a></p><p> maps of the same territory.  Though the maps are identical, each may obtain the exclusive right to make copies of his own particular map, and yet neither will infringe the other\'s copyright.  Likewise, a copyrighted directory is not infringed by a similar directory which is the product of independent work. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  The copyright protects originality, rather than novelty or invention -- conferring only "the sole right of multiplying copies." [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  Absent copying, there can be no infringement of copyright. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Thus, respondents may not exclude others from using statuettes of human figures in table lamps; they may only prevent use of copies of their statuettes as such or as incorporated in some other article.  Regulation \xc2\xa7 202.8, <em>supra,</em> makes clear that artistic articles are protected in "form, but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects."  <em>See Stein v. Rosenthal,</em> 103 F.Supp. 227, 231.  The dichotomy of protection for the aesthetic is not beauty and utility, but art for the copyright and the invention of original and ornamental design for design patents.  We find nothing in the copyright statute to support the argument that the intended use or use in industry of an article eligible for copyright bars or invalidates its registration.  We do not read such a limitation into the copyright law.</p>\n<p>Nor do we think the subsequent registration of a work of art published as an element in a manufactured article, is a misuse of the copyright.  This is not different from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 347 U. S. 219</a></p><p> the registration of a statuette and its later embodiment in an industrial article.</p>\n<p>"The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration."  <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/131/case.html">334 U. S. 131</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/131/case.html#158">334 U. S. 158</a></span>.  However, it is</p>\n<p>"intended definitely to grant valuable, enforceable rights to authors, publishers, etc., without burdensome requirements; \'to afford greater encouragement to the production of literary [or artistic] works of lasting benefit to the world.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Washingtonian Pub.

If we should endeavor to classify it under the head of writings of authors, the objections are equally strong.  In this, as in regard to inventions, originality is required.  And while the word writings may be liberally construed, as it has been, to include original designs for engraving, prints, &amp;c., it is only such as are original, and are founded in the creative powers of the mind.  The writings which are to be protected are <em>the fruits of intellectual labor,</em> embodied in the form of books, prints, engravings, and the like."</p>\n<p>The trademark does not</p>\n<p>"depend upon novelty, invention, discovery, or any work of the brain.

And the thing invented or produced, for which a patent is given, is that which gives a peculiar or distinctive appearance to the manufacture, or article to which it may be applied, or to which it gives form. . . .  It therefore proposes to secure for a limited time to the ingenious producer of those appearances the advantages flowing from them. . . .  It is the appearance itself, therefore, no matter by what agency caused, that constitutes mainly, if not entirely, the contribution to the public which the law deems worthy of recompense."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p><em>E.g.,</em> Design Patent 170.445 Base for table lamps, a fanciful statuette of a girl standing in front of a high rock in bathing costume.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T36" name="F36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>The English Copyright Act, 1911, \xc2\xa7 22, 4 Halsbury\'s Statutes of England (2d ed.) p. 800, does not protect designs registrable under the Patents and Designs Act (now the Registered Designs Act, 1949, 17 Halsbury\'s Statutes of England (2d ed.)), unless such designs are not used or intended to be used as models or patterns to be multiplied by any industrial process.

Cohan,</em> 154 F.2d 827.</p>\n<p>Opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, in which MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs.</p>\n<p>An important constitutional question underlies this case -- a question which was stirred on oral argument, but not treated in the briefs.  It is whether these statuettes of dancing figures may be copyrighted.  Congress has provided that "works of art," "models or designs for works of art," and "reproductions of a work of art" may be copyrighted, 17 U.S.C \xc2\xa7 5, and the Court holds that these statuettes are included in the words "works of art."  But may statuettes be granted the monopoly of the copyright?</p>\n<p>Article I, \xc2\xa7 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power</p>\n<p>"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="220">Page 347 U. S. 220</a></p><p> exclusive Right to their respective Writings. . . ."</p>\n<p>The power is thus circumscribed:  it allows a monopoly to be granted only to "authors" for their "writings."  Is a sculptor an "author," and is his statute a "writing," within the meaning of the Constitution?  We have never decided the question.</p>\n<p><em>Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/53/case.html">111 U. S. 53</a></span>, held that a photograph could be copyrighted.</p>\n<p><em>Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/239/case.html">188 U. S. 239</a></span>, held that chromolithographs to be used as advertisements for a circus were "pictorial illustrations" within the meaning of the copyright laws.  Broad language was used in the latter case,</p>\n<p>". . . a very modest grade of art has in it something irreducible, which is one man\'s alone.  That something he may copyright unless there is a restriction in the words of the act."</p>\n<p>188 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/239/case.html#250">188 U. S. 250</a></span>.  But the constitutional range of the meaning of "writings" in the field of art was not in issue either in the <em>Bleistein</em> case nor in <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/228/case.html">344 U. S. 228</a></span>, recently here on a writ for certiorari limited to a question of damages.</p>\n<p>At times, the Court has, on its own initiative, considered and decided constitutional issues not raised, argued, or briefed by the parties.  Such, for example, was the case of <em>Continental Illinois Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/648/case.html">294 U. S. 648</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/294/648/case.html#667">294 U. S. 667</a></span>, in which the Court decided the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, though the question was not noticed by any party.  We could do the same here, and decide the question here and now.  This case, however, is not a pressing one, there being no urgency for a decision.  Moreover, the constitutional materials are quite meager (<em>see</em> Fenning, The Origin of the Patent and Copyright Clause of the Constitution, 17 Geo.L.J. 109 (1929)), and much research is needed.</p>\n<p>The interests involved in the category of "works of art," as used in the copyright law, are considerable.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="221">Page 347 U. S. 221</a></p><p> Copyright Office has supplied us with a long list of such articles which have been copyrighted -- statuettes, book ends, clocks, lamps, door knockers, candlesticks, inkstands, chandeliers, piggy banks, sundials, salt and pepper shakers, fish bowls, casseroles, and ash trays.  Perhaps these are all "writings" in the constitutional sense.  But, to me, at least, they are not obviously so.  It is time that we came to the problem full face.  I would accordingly put the case down for reargument.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
