Relying largely on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Turkette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/576/index.html">452 U.

The court also told the jury that an association-in-fact\xe2\x80\x99s existence is often more readily proved by what it does than by abstract analysis of its structure, and denied Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s request for an instruction requiring the Government to prove that the enterprise had \xe2\x80\x9can ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Boyle was convicted, and the Second Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a \xe2\x80\x9cstructure,\xe2\x80\x9d but the pertinent jury instruction need not be framed in the precise language Boyle proposes, i.e., </em>as having<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9can ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In light of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s broad statement that an enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cincludes any \xe2\x80\xa6 group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71961(4), and the requirement that RICO be \xe2\x80\x9cliberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d note following \xc2\xa71961, <em>Turkette</em> explained that \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d reaches \xe2\x80\x9ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d 452 U.

This question can be broken into three parts.  First, the enterprise must have a \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d that, under RICO\xe2\x80\x99s terms, has at least three features:\xc2\xa0a purpose, relationships among the associates, and longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  See <em>Turkette, </em>452 U. S., at 583.  The instructions need not actually use the term \xe2\x80\x9cstructure,\xe2\x80\x9d however, so long as the relevant point\xe2\x80\x99s substance is adequately expressed.  Second, because a jury must find the existence of elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, requiring a jury to find the existence of a structure that is <em>ascertainable</em> would be redundant and potentially misleading.  Third, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d is correctly interpreted to mean that the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s existence is a separate element that must be proved, not that such existence may never be inferred from the evidence showing that the associates engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.  See <em>ibid.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s argument that an enterprise must have structural features additional to those that can be fairly inferred from RICO\xe2\x80\x99s language\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> a hierarchical structure or chain of command; fixed roles for associates; and an enterprise name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies\xe2\x80\x94has no basis in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  As <em>Turkette</em> said, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.  The breadth of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d concept is highlighted by comparing the statute with other federal laws having much more stringent requirements for targeting organized criminal groups: <em>E.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71955(b) defines an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal gambling business\xe2\x80\x9d as one that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Rejection of Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s argument does not lead to a merger of the \xc2\xa71962(c) crime and other federal offenses.  For example, proof that a defendant violated \xc2\xa71955 does not necessarily establish that he conspired to participate in a gambling enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  Rather, that would require the prosecution to prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \xc2\xa71955 violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes.  See \xc2\xa71961(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Because RICO\xe2\x80\x99s language is clear, the Court need not reach Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s statutory purpose, legislative history, or rule-of-lenity arguments.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The instructions below were correct and adequate.  By explicitly telling jurors they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise, the instructions made clear that this was a separate element from the pattern of racketeering activity.  The jurors also were adequately told that the enterprise needed the structural attributes that may be inferred from the statutory language.  Finally, the instruction that an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s existence \xe2\x80\x9cis oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure\xe2\x80\x9d properly conveyed <em>Turkette</em>\xe2\x80\x99s point that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit an inference of the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s existence.

We hold that such an enterprise must have a \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d but that an instruction framed in this precise language is not necessary.  The District Court properly instructed the jury in this case.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial was sufficient to prove the following: Petitioner and others participated in a series of bank thefts in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin during the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.  The participants in these crimes included a core group, along with others who were recruited from time to time.  Although the participants sometimes attempted bank-vault burglaries and bank robberies, the group usually targeted cash-laden night-deposit boxes, which are often found in banks in retail areas. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each theft was typically carried out by a group of participants who met beforehand to plan the crime, gather tools (such as crowbars, fishing gaffs, and walkie-talkies), and assign the roles that each participant would play (such as lookout and driver).  The participants generally split the proceeds from the thefts.  The group was loosely and informally organized.  It does not appear to have had a leader or hierarchy; nor does it appear that the participants ever formulated any long-term master plan or agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From 1991 to 1994, the core group was responsible for more than 30 night-deposit-box thefts.  By 1994, petitioner had joined the group, and over the next five years, he participated in numerous attempted night-deposit-box thefts and at least two attempted bank-vault burglaries. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, petitioner was indicted for participation in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962(c); conspiracy to commit that offense, in violation of \xc2\xa71962(d); conspiracy to commit bank burglary, in violation of \xc2\xa7371; and nine counts of bank burglary and attempted bank burglary, in violation of \xc2\xa72113(a).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In instructing the jury on the meaning of a RICO \xe2\x80\x9centerprise,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court relied largely on language in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Turkette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/576/index.html">452 U. S. 576</a> (1981).  The court told the jurors that, in order to establish the existence of such an enterprise, the Government had to prove that:  \xe2\x80\x9c(1) There [was] an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2) the various members and associates of the association function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 112.  Over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the court also told the jury that it could \xe2\x80\x9cfind an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommon sense suggests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 111\xe2\x80\x93112.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Petitioner<em> </em>requested an instruction that the Government was required to prove that the enterprise \xe2\x80\x9chad an ongoing organization, a core membership that functioned as a continuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95.  The District Court refused to give that instruction. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner was convicted on 11 of the 12 counts against him, including the RICO counts, and was sentenced to 151 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  In a summary order, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction but vacated the sentence on a ground not relevant to the issues before us.  283 Fed. Appx. 825 (2007).  The Court of Appeals did not specifically address the RICO jury instructions, stating only that the arguments not discussed in the order were \xe2\x80\x9cwithout merit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 826.  Petitioner was then resentenced, and we granted certiorari, 554 U.

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935), and the very concept of an association in fact is expansive.

We will break this question into three parts.  First, must an association-in-fact enterprise have a \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d?  Second, must the structure be \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable\xe2\x80\x9d?  Third, must the \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d go \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d in which its members engage? </p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStructure.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>We agree with petitioner<em> </em>that<em> </em>an association-in-fact enterprise must have a structure.  In the sense relevant here, the term \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a complex entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed. 2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pattern of relationships, as of status or friendship, existing among the members of a group or society\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  As we succinctly put it in <em>Turkette</em>, an association-in-fact enterprise is \xe2\x80\x9ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  452 U. S., at 583.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d must have a purpose is apparent from meaning of the term in ordinary usage, <em>i.e.</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cventure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cundertaking,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproject.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976).  The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cassociat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d requires both interpersonal relationships and a common interest.  See <em>id.</em>, at 132 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cassociation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can organization of persons having a common interest\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cassociation\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9ccollection of persons who have joined together for a certain object\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 1962(c) reinforces this conclusion and also shows that an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d must have some longevity, since the offense proscribed by that provision demands proof that the enterprise had \xe2\x80\x9caffairs\xe2\x80\x9d of sufficient duration to permit an associate to \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate\xe2\x80\x9d in those affairs through \xe2\x80\x9ca pattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although an association-in-fact enterprise must have these structural features, it does not follow that a district court must use the term \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d in its jury instructions.  A trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing the language of an instruction so long as the substance of the relevant point is adequately expressed. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAscertainable.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  Whenever a jury is told that it must find the existence of an element beyond a reasonable doubt, that element must be \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable\xe2\x80\x9d or else the jury could not find that it was proved.  Therefore, telling the members of the jury that they had to ascertain the existence of an \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable structure\xe2\x80\x9d would have been redundant and potentially misleading. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d</em>  This phrase may be interpreted in least two different ways, and its correctness depends on the particular sense in which the phrase is used.  If the phrase is interpreted to mean that the existence of an enterprise is a separate element that must be proved, it is of course correct.  As we explained in <em>Turkette</em>, the existence of an enterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and \xe2\x80\x9cproof of one does not necessarily establish the other.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  452 U.

We recognized in <em>Turkette</em> that the evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cmay in particular cases coalesce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crux of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that a RICO enterprise must have structural features in addition to those that we think can be fairly inferred from the language of the statute.  Although petitioner concedes that an association-in-fact enterprise may be an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98informal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d group and that \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98much\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d structure is needed, Reply Brief for Petitioner 24, he contends that such an enterprise must have at least some additional structural attributes, such as a structural \xe2\x80\x9chierarchy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crole differentiation,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cunique <em>modus operandi</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cchain of command,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprofessionalism and sophistication of organization,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity and complexity of crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmembership dues, rules and regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuncharged or additional crimes aside from predicate acts,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cinternal discipline mechanism,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregular meetings regarding enterprise affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise \xe2\x80\x98name,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinduction or initiation ceremonies and rituals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9335; see also Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9328, 33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 8, 17. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no basis in the language of RICO for the structural requirements that petitioner asks us to recognize.  As we said in <em>Turkette</em>, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.  Such a group need not have a hierarchical structure or a \xe2\x80\x9cchain of command\xe2\x80\x9d; decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis and by any number of methods\xe2\x80\x94by majority vote, consensus, a show of strength, etc.  Members of the group need not have fixed roles; different members may perform different roles at different times.  The group need not have a name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies.  While the group must function as a continuing unit and remain in existence long enough to pursue a course of conduct, nothing in RICO exempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts of activity punctuated by periods of quiescence.  Nor is the statute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated, diverse, complex, or unique; for example, a group that does nothing but engage in extortion through old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and brutal means may fall squarely within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The breadth of the \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d concept in RICO is highlighted by comparing the statute with other federal statutes that target organized criminal groups.  For example, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71955(b), which was enacted together with RICO as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 922, defines an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal gambling business\xe2\x80\x9d as one that \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing criminal enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7848(c), must involve more than five persons who act in concert and must have an \xe2\x80\x9corganizer,\xe2\x80\x9d supervisor, or other manager.  Congress included no such requirements in RICO.  </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims, rejection of his argument regarding these structural characteristics does not lead to a merger of the crime proscribed by 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962(c) (participating in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity) and any of the following offenses: operating a gambling business, \xc2\xa71955; conspiring to commit one or more crimes that are listed as RICO predicate offenses, \xc2\xa7371; or conspiring to violate the RICO statute, \xc2\xa71962(d). </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proof that a defendant violated \xc2\xa71955 does not necessarily establish that the defendant conspired to participate in the affairs of a gambling enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  In order to prove the latter offense, the prosecution must prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \xc2\xa71955 violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes.  See \xc2\xa71961(1).  No such proof is needed to establish a simple violation of \xc2\xa71955.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, proof that a defendant conspired to commit a RICO predicate offense\xe2\x80\x94for example, arson\xe2\x80\x94does not necessarily establish that the defendant participated in the affairs of an arson enterprise through a pattern of arson crimes.  Under \xc2\xa7371, a conspiracy is an inchoate crime that may be completed in the brief period needed for the formation of the agreement and the commission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Feola</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/671/index.html">420 U. S. 671</a>, 694 (1975).  Section 1962(c) demands much more: the creation of an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a group with a common purpose and course of conduct\xe2\x80\x94and the actual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, while in practice the elements of a violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(c) and (d) are similar, this overlap would persist even if petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conception of an association-in-fact enterprise were accepted.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the statutory language is clear, there is no need to reach petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s remaining arguments based on statutory purpose, legislative history, or the rule of lenity.  In prior cases, we have rejected similar arguments in favor of the clear but expansive text of the statute.  See <em>National Organization for Women</em>, 510 U.

This instruction properly conveyed the point we made in <em>Turkette </em>that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit a jury to infer the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The relevant portion of the instructions was as follows: </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98enterprise\xe2\x80\x99 as used in these instructions may also include a group of people associated in fact, even though this association is not recognized as a legal entity.  Indeed, an enterprise need not have a name.  Thus, an enterprise need not be a form[al] business entity such as a corporation, but may be merely an informal association of individuals.  A group or association of people can be an \xe2\x80\x98enterprise\xe2\x80\x99 if, among other requirements, these individuals \xe2\x80\x98associate\xe2\x80\x99 together for a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.  Common sense sug-\ngests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, you may find an enterprise where an association of individuals, <em>without structural hierarchy</em>, forms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts.  Such an association of persons may be established by evidence showing an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and . . . by evidence that the people making up the association functioned as a continuing unit.  Therefore, in order to establish the existence of such an enterprise, the government must prove that: (1) There is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2) the various members and associates of the association function as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegarding \xe2\x80\x98organization,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>it is not necessary that the enterprise have any particular or formal structure</em>, but it must have sufficient organization that its members functioned and operated in a coordinated manner in order to carry out the alleged common purpose or purposes of the enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 111\xe2\x80\x93113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This provision does not purport to set out an exhaustive definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9centerprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare<em> </em>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (defining what the terms \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d <em>mean</em>) with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961(3)\xe2\x80\x93(4) (defining what the terms \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x9d <em>include</em>).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71961 <em>et seq.</em>, to refer only to business-like entities that have an existence apart from the predicate acts committed by their employees or associates.  The trial judge in this case committed two significant errors relating to the meaning of that term.  First, he instructed the jury that \xe2\x80\x9can association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\xe2\x80\x9d can constitute an enterprise.  App. 112.  And he allowed the jury to find that element satisfied by evidence showing a group of criminals with no existence beyond its intermittent commission of racketeering acts and related offenses.  Because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision affirming petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction is inconsistent with the statutory meaning of the term enterprise and serves to expand RICO liability far beyond the bounds Congress intended, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RICO makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71962(c).

See <em>id.</em>, at 177\xe2\x80\x93179.  This requirement confirms that the enterprise element demands evidence of a certain quantum of business-like organization\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a system of processes, dealings, or other affairs that can be \xe2\x80\x9cdirected.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases also make clear that an enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cis an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Turkette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/576/index.html"></a><a href="/us/452/576/index.html">452 U.

If an entity\xe2\x80\x99s existence consisted solely of its members\xe2\x80\x99 performance of a pattern of racketeering acts, the \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs\xe2\x80\x9d would be synonymous with the \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1962(c) would then prohibit an individual from conducting or participating in \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct of [a pattern of racketeering activity] through a pattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a reading that is unbearably redundant, particularly in a case like this one in which a single pattern of activity is alleged.  The only way to avoid that result is to require that an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs\xe2\x80\x9d be something other than the pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by its members.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s business-like nature and its distinctness from the pattern of predicate acts, however, does not answer the question of what proof each element requires.  In cases involving a legal entity, the matter of proving the enterprise element is straightforward, as the entity\xe2\x80\x99s legal existence will always be something apart from the pattern of activity performed by the defendant or his associates.

There may be cases in which a jury can infer that existence and continuity from the evidence used to establish the pattern of racketeering activity.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But that will be true only when the pattern of activity is so complex that it could not be performed in the absence of structures or processes for planning or concealing the illegal conduct beyond those inherent in performing the predicate acts.  More often, proof of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s separate existence will require different evidence from that used to establish the pattern of predicate acts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Precisely what proof is required in each case is a more difficult question, largely due to the abundant variety of RICO predicates and enterprises.  Because covered enterprises are necessarily business-like in nature, however, proof of an association-in-fact enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s separate existence will generally require evidence of rules, routines, or processes through which the entity maintains its continuing operations and seeks to conceal its illegal acts.  As petitioner suggests, this requirement will usually be satisfied by evidence that the association has an \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Examples of such structure include an organizational hierarchy, a \xe2\x80\x9cframework for making decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cinternal discipline mechanism,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregular meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d or a practice of \xe2\x80\x9creinvest[ing] proceeds to promote and expand the enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 31\xe2\x80\x9334.  In other cases, the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s existence might be established through evidence that it provides goods or services to third parties, as such an undertaking will require organizational elements more comprehensive than those necessary to perform a pattern of predicate acts.  Thus, the evidence needed to establish an enterprise will vary from case to case, but in every case the Government must carry its burden of proving that an alleged enterprise has an existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by its constituents.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some respects, my reading of the statute is not very different from that adopted by the Court.  We agree that \xe2\x80\x9can association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But the Court stops short of giving content to that requirement.  It states only that RICO \xe2\x80\x9cdemands proof that the enterprise had \xe2\x80\x98affairs\xe2\x80\x99 of sufficient duration to permit an associate to \xe2\x80\x98participate\xe2\x80\x99 in those affairs through \xe2\x80\x98a pattern of racketeering activity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d before concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing the language of an instruction\xe2\x80\x9d and need not use the term \xe2\x80\x9cstructure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.\xc2\xa0 While I agree the word structure is not talismanic, I would hold that the instructions must convey the requirement that the alleged enterprise have an existence apart from the alleged pattern of predicate acts.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, by contrast, will allow juries to infer the existence of an enterprise in every case involving a pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by two or more associates.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By permitting the Government to prove both elements with the same evidence, the Court renders the enterprise requirement essentially meaningless in association-in-fact cases.  It also threatens to make that category of \xc2\xa71962(c) offenses indistinguishable from conspiracies to commit predicate acts, see \xc2\xa7371, as the only remaining difference is \xc2\xa71962(c)\xe2\x80\x99s pattern requirement.  The Court resists this criticism, arguing that \xc2\xa71962(c) \xe2\x80\x9cdemands much more\xe2\x80\x9d than the inchoate offense defined in \xc2\xa7371.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  It states that the latter \xe2\x80\x9cmay be completed in the brief period needed for the formation of the agreement and the commission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas the former requires the creation of \xe2\x80\x9ca group with a common purpose and course of conduct\xe2\x80\x94and the actual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to violate \xc2\xa71962(c), see \xc2\xa71962(d), this comment provides no assurance that RICO and \xc2\xa7371 offenses remain distinct.  Only if proof of the enterprise element\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cgroup with a common purpose and course of conduct\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94requires evidence of activity or organization beyond that inherent in the pattern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity distinct from \xc2\xa7371 offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case illustrates these concerns.  The trial judge instructed the jury that an enterprise need have only the degree of organization necessary \xe2\x80\x9cfor carrying out its objectives\xe2\x80\x9d and that it could \xe2\x80\x9cfind an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 112.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  These instructions were plainly deficient, as they did not require the Government to prove that the alleged enterprise had an existence apart from the pattern of predicate acts.  Instead, they permitted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proof of the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s structure and continuing nature\xe2\x80\x94requirements on which all agree\xe2\x80\x94to consist only of evidence that petitioner and his associates performed a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s requested instruction would have required the jury to find that the alleged enterprise \xe2\x80\x9chad an ongoing organization, a core membership that functioned as a continuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95.  That instruction does not precisely track my understanding of the statute; although evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cstructural hierarchy\xe2\x80\x9d can evidence an enterprise, it is not necessary to establish that element.  Nevertheless, the proposed instruction would have better directed the jury to consider whether the alleged enterprise possessed the separate existence necessary to expose petitioner to liability under \xc2\xa71962(c), and the trial judge should have considered an instruction along those lines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge also erred in finding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence in this case sufficient to support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s RICO convictions.  Petitioner was alleged to have participated and conspired to participate in the conduct of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of one act of bank robbery and three acts of interstate transportation of stolen funds.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprimary goals\xe2\x80\x9d of the alleged enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cincluded generating money for its members and associates through the commission of criminal activity, including bank robberies, bank burglaries and interstate transportation of stolen money.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 14.  And its <em>modus operandi </em>was to congregate periodically when an associate had a lead on a night-deposit box that the group could break into.  Whoever among the associates was available would bring screwdrivers, crowbars, and walkie-talkies to the location.  Some acted as lookouts, while others retrieved the money.  When the endeavor was successful, the participants would split the proceeds.  Thus, the group\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and activities, and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s participation therein, were limited to sporadic acts of taking money from bank deposit boxes.  There is no evidence in RICO\xe2\x80\x99s text or history that Congress intended it to reach such ad\xc2\xa0hoc<em> </em>associations of thieves.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the instructions and evidence in this case did not satisfy the requirement that an alleged enterprise have an existence separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be sure, we have read RICO\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise term broadly to include entities with exclusively noneconomic motives or wholly unlawful purposes.  See <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheidler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/249/index.html">510 U. S. 249</a>, 252 (1994) <em>(NOW);</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Turkette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/576/index.html"></a><a href="/us/452/576/index.html">452 U. S. 576</a>, 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (1981).  But those holdings are consistent with the conclusion that an enterprise is a business-like entity.  Indeed, the examples of qualifying associations cited in <em>Turkette</em>\xe2\x80\x94including loan-sharking, property-fencing, drug-trafficking, and counterfeiting operations\xe2\x80\x94satisfy that criterion, as each describes an organization with continuing operations directed toward providing goods or services to its customers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 589\xe2\x80\x93590 (citing 84 Stat. 923; 116 Cong. Rec. 592 (1970)).  Similarly, the enterprise at issue in <em>NOW </em>was a nationwide network of antiabortion groups that had a leadership counsel and regular conferences and whose members undertook an extensive pattern of extortion, arson, and other racketeering activity for the purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cshut[ting] down abortion clinics.\xe2\x80\x9d  510 U. S., at 253.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The other subsections of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71962 further demonstrate the business-like nature of the enterprise element and its necessary distinctness from the pattern of racketeering activity.  Subsection (a) prohibits anyone who receives income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity from \xe2\x80\x9cus[ing] or invest[ing], directly or indirectly, any part of such income \xe2\x80\xa6 in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  And subsection (b) prohibits anyone from \xe2\x80\x9cacquir[ing] or maintain[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d any interest in or control of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  We noted in <em>NOW</em> that the term enterprise \xe2\x80\x9cplays a different role in the structure\xe2\x80\x9d of those subsections than it does in subsection (c) because the enterprise in those subsections is the victim.  510 U. S., at 258\xe2\x80\x93259.  We did not, however, suggest that the term has a substantially different meaning in each subsection.  To the contrary, our observation that the enterprise in subsection (c) is \xe2\x80\x9cthe vehicle through which the unlawful pattern of racketeering activity is committed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 259,<em> </em>indicates that, as in subsections (a) and (b), the enterprise must have an existence apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For the full text of the relevant portion of the instructions, see <em>ante</em>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
