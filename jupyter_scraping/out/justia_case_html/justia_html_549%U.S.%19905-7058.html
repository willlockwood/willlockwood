S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a).  Petitioners, inmates in Michigan prisons, filed grievances using the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) grievance process.  After unsuccessfully seeking redress through that process, petitioner Jones filed a 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 suit against six prison officials.  The District Court dismissed on the merits as to four of them and as to two others found that Jones had failed to adequately plead exhaustion in his complaint.  Petitioner Williams also filed a \xc2\xa71983 suit after his two MDOC grievances were denied.  The District Court found that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to one of the grievances because he had not identified any of the respondents named in the lawsuit during the grievance process.  While the court found Williams\xe2\x80\x99s other claim properly exhausted, it dismissed the entire suit under the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s total exhaustion rule for PLRA cases.  Petitioner Walton\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71983 lawsuit also was dismissed under the total exhaustion rule because his MDOC grievance named only one of the six defendants in his lawsuit.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed in each case, relying on its procedural rules that require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants identified in the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rules are not required by the PLRA, and crafting and imposing such rules exceeds the proper limits of the judicial role.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.  There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA, <em>Porter</em> v. <em>Nussle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/516/index.html">534 U. S. 516</a>, 524, but it is less clear whether the prisoner must plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint or the defendant must raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense.  Failure to exhaust is better viewed as an affirmative defense.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d in a complaint, and PLRA claims are typically brought under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, which does not require exhaustion at all.  The fact that the PLRA dealt extensively with exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded or is an affirmative defense, is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense, including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, <em>Day</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___.  Courts should generally not depart from the Federal Rules\xe2\x80\x99 usual practice based on perceived policy concerns.  See, <em>e.g., Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a>  Those courts that require prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion contend that prisoner complaints must be treated outside of the typical framework if the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s screening requirement is to function effectively.  But the screening requirement does not\xe2\x80\x94explicitly or implicitly\xe2\x80\x94justify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself.  Although exhaustion was a \xe2\x80\x9ccenterpiece\xe2\x80\x9d of the PLRA, <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Ngo</em>, 548 U. S. ___, ___, failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early screening.  Section1997e(g)\xe2\x80\x94which allows defendants to waive their right to reply to a prisoner complaint without being deemed to have admitted the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations\xe2\x80\x94shows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.  Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result \xe2\x80\x9cmust be obtained by \xe2\x80\xa6 amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leatherman, supra, </em>at 168.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Exhaustion is not <em>per se</em> inadequate under the PLRA when an individual later sued was not named in the grievance.  Nothing in the MDOC policy supports the conclusion that the grievance process was improperly invoked because an individual later named as a defendant was not named at the first step of the process; at the time each grievance was filed here, the MDOC policy did not specifically require a prisoner to name anyone in the grievance.  Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement.  The \xe2\x80\x9capplicable procedural rules\xe2\x80\x9d that a prisoner must properly exhaust, <em>Woodford, supra, </em>at ___, are defined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself.  As the MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s procedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.  The Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule may promote early notice to those who might later be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement.  The court below should determine in the first instance whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 grievances otherwise satisfied the exhaustion requirement.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The PLRA does not require dismissal of the entire complaint when a prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims included in the complaint.  Respondents argue that had Congress intended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the balance of the lawsuit, it would have used the word \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71997e(a), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d unless administrative procedures are exhausted.  That boilerplate language is used in many instances in the Federal Code, and statutory references to an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d have not typically been read to mean that every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent requirement before the \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d may proceed.  If a complaint contains both good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and leaves the bad.  Respondents note that the total exhaustion requirement in habeas corpus is an exception to this general rule, but a court presented with a mixed habeas petition typically \xe2\x80\x9callow[s] the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U. S. 269</a>, 278, which is the opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule that respondents argue against.  Although other PLRA sections distinguish between actions and claims, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa71997e(a) creates its own inconsistencies, and their policy arguments are also unpersuasive.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e <em>et seq</em>.  Among other reforms, the PLRA mandates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71915A; 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a).  The Sixth Circuit, along with some other lower courts, adopted several procedural rules designed to implement this exhaustion requirement and facilitate early judicial screening.  These rules require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants who were identified by the prisoner in his grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.  Other lower courts declined to adopt such rules.  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict and now conclude that these rules are not required by the PLRA, and that crafting and imposing them exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prisoner litigation continues to \xe2\x80\x9caccount for an outsized share of filings\xe2\x80\x9d in federal district courts.  <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Ngo</em>, 548 U. S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa04 (2006) (slip op., at 12, n.\xc2\xa04).  In 2005, nearly 10 percent of all civil cases filed in federal courts nationwide were prisoner complaints challenging prison conditions or claiming civil rights violations.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Most of these cases have no merit; many are frivolous.  Our legal system, however, remains committed to guaranteeing that prisoner claims of illegal conduct by their custodians are fairly handled according to law.  The challenge lies in ensuring that the flood of nonmeritorious claims does not submerge and effectively preclude consideration of the allegations with merit.  See <em>Neitzke</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/319/index.html">490 U. S. 319</a>, 327 (1989).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress addressed that challenge in the PLRA.  What this country needs, Congress decided, is fewer and better prisoner suits.  See <em>Porter</em> v. <em>Nussle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/516/index.html">534 U. S. 516</a>, 524 (2002) (PLRA intended to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits\xe2\x80\x9d).  To that end, Congress enacted a variety of reforms designed to filter out the bad claims and facilitate consideration of the good.  Key among these was the requirement that inmates complaining about prison conditions exhaust prison grievance remedies before initiating a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The exhaustion provision of the PLRA states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nRequiring exhaustion allows prison officials an opportunity to resolve disputes concerning the exercise of their responsibilities before being haled into court.  This has the potential to reduce the number of inmate suits, and also to improve the quality of suits that are filed by producing a useful administrative record.  <em>Woodford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 12).  In an attempt to implement the exhaustion requirement, some lower courts have imposed procedural rules that have become the subject of varying levels of disagreement among the federal courts of appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first question presented centers on a conflict over whether exhaustion under the PLRA is a pleading requirement the prisoner must satisfy in his complaint or an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Sixth Circuit, adopting the former view, requires prisoners to attach proof of exhaustion\xe2\x80\x94typically copies of the grievances\xe2\x80\x94to their complaints to avoid dismissal.  If no written record of the grievance is available, the inmate must plead with specificity how and when he exhausted the grievance procedures.  <em>Knuckles El</em> v. <em>Toombs</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 640, 642 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next issue concerns how courts determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted administrative remedies\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the level of detail required in a grievance to put the prison and individual officials on notice of the claim.  The Sixth Circuit requires that a prisoner have identified, in the first step of the grievance process, each individual later named in the lawsuit to properly exhaust administrative remedies.  <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d 569, 575 (2003).  Other circuits have taken varying approaches to this question, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Butler</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, 397 F.\xc2\xa03d 1181, 1183 (CA9 2005) (proper exhaustion requires use of the administrative process provided by the State; if that process does not require identification of specific persons, neither does the PLRA); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 385 F. 3d 503, 522 (CA5 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he grievance must provide administrators with a fair opportunity under the circumstances to address the problem that will later form the basis of the suit\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Riccardo</em> v. <em>Rausch</em>, 375 F. 3d 521, 524 (CA7 2004) (exhaustion satisfied if grievance \xe2\x80\x9cserved its function of alerting the state and inviting corrective action\xe2\x80\x9d), none going as far as the Sixth Circuit in requiring in every case that the defendants have been named from the beginning of the grievance process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the circuits are divided over what the PLRA requires when both exhausted and unexhausted claims are included in a complaint.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Some circuits, including the Sixth Circuit, apply a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal exhaustion\xe2\x80\x9d rule, under which no part of the suit may proceed if any single claim in the action is not properly exhausted.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jones Bey</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d 801, 805 (CA6 2005).  Among circuits requiring total exhaustion there is further disagreement over what to do if the requirement is not met.  Most courts allow the prisoner to amend his complaint to include only exhausted claims, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kozohorsky</em> v. <em>Harmon</em>, 332 F. 3d 1141, 1144 (CA8 2003), but the Sixth Circuit denies leave to amend, dismisses the action, and requires that it be filed anew with only unexhausted claims, <em>Baxter</em> v. <em>Rose</em>, 305 F.\xc2\xa03d 486, 488 (2002); <em>Jones Bey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 807.  See also <em>McGore</em> v. <em>Wrigglesworth</em>, 114 F.\xc2\xa03d 601, 612 (1997).  Other circuits reject total exhaustion altogether, instead dismissing only unexhausted claims and considering the rest on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>McBride</em>, 380 F. 3d 649, 663 (CA2 2004).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are inmates in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC).  At the time petitioners filed their grievances, MDOC Policy Directive 03.02.130 (Nov. 1, 2000) set forth the applicable grievance procedures.  1 App. 138\xe2\x80\x93157.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The policy directive describes what issues are grievable and contains instructions for filing and processing grievances.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Inmates must first attempt to resolve a problem orally within two business days of becoming aware of the grievable issue.  <em>Id., </em>at 147.  If oral resolution is unsuccessful, the inmate may proceed to Step I of the grievance process, and submit a completed grievance form within five business days of the attempted oral resolution.  <em>Id.,</em> at 147, 149\xe2\x80\x93150.  The Step I grievance form provided by MDOC (a one-page form on which the inmate fills out identifying information and is given space to describe the complaint) advises inmates to be \xe2\x80\x9cbrief and concise in describing your grievance issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 <em>id., </em>at 1.  The inmate submits the grievance to a designated grievance coordinator, who assigns it to a respondent\xe2\x80\x94generally the supervisor of the person being grieved.  1 <em>id., </em>at 150.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Step I response, he may appeal to Step II by obtaining an appeal form within five business days of the response, and submitting the appeal within five business days of obtaining the form.  <em>Id., </em>at 152.  The respondent at Step II is designated by the policy, <em>id., </em>at 152\xe2\x80\x93153 (<em>e.g.</em>, the regional health administrator for medical care grievances).  If still dissatisfied after Step II, the inmate may further appeal to Step III using the same appeal form; the MDOC director is designated as respondent for all Step III appeals.  <em>Id., </em>at 154.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Lorenzo Jones</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Lorenzo Jones is incarcerated at the MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s Saginaw Correctional Facility.  In November 2000, while in MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s custody, Jones was involved in a vehicle accident and suffered significant injuries to his neck and back.  Several months later Jones was given a work assignment he allegedly could not perform in light of his injuries.  According to Jones, respondent Paul Morrison\xe2\x80\x94in charge of work assignments at the prison\xe2\x80\x94made the inappropriate assignment, even though he knew of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s injuries.  When Jones reported to the assignment, he informed the staff member in charge\xe2\x80\x94respondent Michael Opanasenko\xe2\x80\x94that he could not perform the work; Opanasenko allegedly told him to do the work or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98suffer the consequences.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., </em>at 20.

He did not, however, attach copies of the grievance forms or describe the proceedings with specificity.  Respondents attached copies of all of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s grievances to their own motion to dismiss, but the District Judge ruled that Jones\xe2\x80\x99s failure to meet his burden to plead exhaustion in his complaint could not be cured by respondents.  <em>Id.,</em> at 42.  The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding both that Jones failed to comply with the specific pleading requirements applied to PLRA suits, 135 Fed.

An MDOC physician recommended further surgery to provide pain relief, but MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s Correctional Medical Services denied the recommendation (and subsequent appeals by the doctor) on the ground that the danger of surgery outweighed the benefits, which it viewed as cosmetic.  The MDOC Medical Services Advisory Committee upheld this decision.  After Correctional Medical Services indicated that it would take the request under advisement, Williams filed a grievance objecting to the quality of his medical care and seeking authorization for the surgery.

He named as respondents Barbara Bouchard (former warden), Ken Gearin, David Bergh, and Ron Bobo (assistant deputy wardens), Catherine Bauman (resident unit manager), and Denise Gerth (assistant resident unit supervisor).</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Judge dismissed the lawsuit because Walton had not named any respondent other than Bobo in his grievance.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reiterating its requirement that a prisoner must \xe2\x80\x9cfile a grievance against the person he ultimately seeks to sue,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 505, and that this requirement can only be satisfied by naming each defendant at Step I of the MDOC grievance process.

Williams and Walton filed a joint petition under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 12.4, contending that the rule requiring every defendant to be named during the grievance process is not required by the PLRA, and also challenging the total exhaustion rule.  We granted both petitions for certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and consolidated the cases for our review.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.  <em>Porter</em>, 534 U. S., at 524.  What is less clear is whether it falls to the prisoner to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint, or to the defendant to raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense.  The minority rule, adopted by the Sixth Circuit, places the burden of pleading exhaustion in a case covered by the PLRA on the prisoner; most courts view failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think petitioners, and the majority of courts to consider the question, have the better of the argument.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d in a complaint, while Rule 8(c) identifies a nonexhaustive list of affirmative defenses that must be pleaded in response.  The PLRA itself is not a source of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim; claims covered by the PLRA are typically brought under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, which does not require exhaustion at all, see <em>Patsy</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/496/index.html">457 U. S. 496</a>, 516 (1982).  Petitioners assert that courts typically regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense in other contexts, see Brief for Petitioners 34\xe2\x80\x9336, and nn. 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (citing cases), and respondents do not seriously dispute the general proposition.  We have referred to exhaustion in these terms, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Universal Maritime Service Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/70/index.html">525 U. S. 70</a>, 75 (1998) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to exhaust\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative defens[e]\xe2\x80\x9d), including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, <em>Day</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 8) (referring to exhaustion as a \xe2\x80\x9cdefense\xe2\x80\x9d)<em>.</em>  The PLRA dealt extensively with the subject of exhaustion, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71997e(a), (c)(2), but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded by the plaintiff or is an affirmative defense.  This is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the usual practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a series of recent cases, we have explained that courts should generally not depart from the usual practice under the Federal Rules on the basis of perceived policy concerns.  Thus, in <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a> (1993), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for imposing a heightened pleading standard in \xc2\xa71983 suits against municipalities.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]erhaps if [the] Rules \xe2\x80\xa6 were rewritten today, claims against municipalities under \xc2\xa71983 might be subjected to the added specificity requirement \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  But that is a result which must be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 168.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Swierkiewicz</em> v. <em>Sorema N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/506/index.html">534 U. S. 506</a> (2002), we unanimously reversed the court of appeals for requiring employment discrimination plaintiffs to specifically allege the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Federal Rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement of greater specificity for particular claims\xe2\x80\x9d must be obtained by amending the Federal Rules.  <em>Id.,</em> at 515 (citing <em>Leatherman</em>).  And just last Term, in <em>Hill</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), we unanimously rejected a proposal that \xc2\xa71983 suits challenging a method of execution must identify an acceptable alternative: \xe2\x80\x9cSpecific pleading requirements are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citing <em>Swierkiewicz</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit and other courts requiring prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints contend that if the \xe2\x80\x9cnew regime\xe2\x80\x9d mandated by the PLRA for prisoner complaints is to function effectively, prisoner complaints must be treated outside of this typical framework.  See <em>Baxter</em>, 305 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 489.  These courts explain that the PLRA not only imposed a new mandatory exhaustion requirement, but also departed in a fundamental way from the usual procedural ground rules by requiring judicial screening to filter out nonmeritorious claims: Courts are to screen inmate complaints \xe2\x80\x9cbefore docketing, if feasible, or \xe2\x80\xa6 as soon as practicable after docketing,\xe2\x80\x9d and dismiss the complaint if it is \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous, malicious, \xe2\x80\xa6 fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted[,] or \xe2\x80\xa6 seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71915A(a), (b).  All this may take place before any responsive pleading is filed\xe2\x80\x94unlike in the typical civil case, defendants do not have to respond to a complaint covered by the PLRA until required to do so by the court, and waiving the right to reply does not constitute an admission of the allegations in the complaint.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(g)(1), (2).  According to respondents, these departures from the normal litigation framework of complaint and response mandate a different pleading requirement for prisoner complaints, if the screening is to serve its intended purpose.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Baxter</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 489 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis court\xe2\x80\x99s heightened pleading standards for complaints covered by the PLRA are designed to facilitate the Act\xe2\x80\x99s screening requirements \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Knuckles El</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 642.  See also Brief for Respondents 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think that the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s screening requirement does not\xe2\x80\x94explicitly or implicitly\xe2\x80\x94justify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself.  Before the PLRA, the <em>in forma pauperis</em> provision of \xc2\xa71915, applicable to most prisoner litigation, permitted <em>sua sponte</em> dismissal only if an action was frivolous or malicious.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71915(d) (1994 ed.); see also <em>Neitzke</em>, 490 U. S., at 320 (concluding that a complaint that fails to state a claim was not frivolous under \xc2\xa71915(d) and thus could not be dismissed <em>sua sponte</em>).  In the PLRA, Congress added failure to state a claim and seeking monetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief as grounds for <em>sua sponte</em> dismissal of <em>in forma pauperis</em> cases, \xc2\xa71915(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.), and provided for judicial screening and <em>sU. S.onte</em> dismissal of prisoner suits on the same four grounds, \xc2\xa71915A(b); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(c)(1).  Although exhaustion was a \xe2\x80\x9ccenterpiece\xe2\x80\x9d of the PLRA, <em>Woodford</em>, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932), failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to this enumeration.  There is thus no reason to suppose that the normal pleading rules have to be altered to facilitate judicial screening of complaints specifically for failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some courts have found that exhaustion is subsumed under the PLRA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated ground authorizing early dismissal for \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71915A(b)(1), 1915(e)(2)(B); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(c)(1).  See <em>Baxter</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 489; <em>Steele</em> v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 1204, 1210 (CA10 2003); <em>Rivera</em> v. <em>Allin</em>, 144 F.\xc2\xa03d 719, 731 (CA11 1998).  The point is a bit of a red herring.  A complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.  If the allegations, for example, show that relief is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim; that does not make the statute of limitations any less an affirmative defense, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c).  Whether a particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish that ground, not on the nature of the ground in the abstract.  See <em>Leveto</em> v. <em>Lapina</em>, 258 F.\xc2\xa03d 156, 161 (CA3 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] complaint may be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when an affirmative defense \xe2\x80\xa6 appears on its face\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See also <em>Lopez-Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Municipality of Comerio</em>, 404 F.\xc2\xa03d 548, 551 (CA1 2005) (dismissing a complaint barred by the statute of limitations under Rule 12(b)(6)); <em>Pani</em> v. <em>Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield</em>, 152 F.\xc2\xa03d 67, 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (CA2 1998) (dismissing a complaint barred by official immunity under Rule 12(b)(6)).  See also 5B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal<em> </em>Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71357, pp.\xc2\xa0708\xe2\x80\x93710, 721\xe2\x80\x93729 (3d ed. 2004).  Determining that Congress meant to include failure to exhaust under the rubric of \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to state a claim\xe2\x80\x9d in the screening provisions of the PLRA would thus not support treating exhaustion as a pleading requirement rather than an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument that screening would be more effective if exhaustion had to be shown in the complaint proves too much; the same could be said with respect to any affirmative defense.  The rejoinder that the PLRA focused on exhaustion rather than other defenses simply highlights the failure of Congress to include exhaustion in terms among the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early screening.  As noted, that is not to say that failure to exhaust cannot be a basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim.  It is to say that there is no basis for concluding that Congress implicitly meant to transform exhaustion from an affirmative defense to a pleading requirement by the curiously indirect route of specifying that courts should screen PLRA complaints and dismiss those that fail to state a claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents point to 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(g) as confirming that the usual pleading rules should not apply to PLRA suits, but we think that provision supports petitioners.  It specifies that defendants can waive their right to reply to a prisoner complaint without the usual consequence of being deemed to have admitted the allegations in the complaint.  See \xc2\xa71997e(g)(1) (allowing defendants to waive their response without admitting the allegations \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other law or rule of procedure\xe2\x80\x9d).  This shows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.  We understand the reasons behind the decisions of some lower courts to impose a pleading requirement on plaintiffs in this context, but that effort cannot fairly be viewed as an interpretation of the PLRA.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wisely suggest,\xe2\x80\x9d the judge\xe2\x80\x99s job is to construe the statute\xe2\x80\x94not to make it better.  Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 527, 533 (1947).  The judge \xe2\x80\x9cmust not read in by way of creation,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead abide by the \xe2\x80\x9cduty of restraint, th[e] humility of function as merely the translator of another\xe2\x80\x99s command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 533\xe2\x80\x93534.

Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result \xe2\x80\x9cmust be obtained by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Leatherman</em>, 507 U.

MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s policy required only that prisoners \xe2\x80\x9cbe as specific as possible\xe2\x80\x9d in their grievances, 1 App. 148, while at the same time the required forms advised them to \xe2\x80\x9c[b]e brief and concise.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 <em>id.</em>, at 1.  The MDOC grievance form does not require a prisoner to identify a particular responsible party, and the respondent is not necessarily the allegedly culpable prison official, but rather an administrative official designated in the policy to respond to particular types of grievances at different levels.  <em>Supra</em>, at 6.  The grievance policy specifically provides that the grievant at Step I \xe2\x80\x9cshall have the opportunity to explain the grievance more completely at [an] interview, enabling the Step I respondent to gather any additional information needed to respond to the grievance.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 151.  Nothing in the MDOC policy itself supports the conclusion that the grievance process was improperly invoked simply because an individual later named as a defendant was not named at the first step of the grievance process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the PLRA impose such a requirement.  In <em>Woodford</em>, we held that to properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,\xe2\x80\x9d 548 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5)\xe2\x80\x94rules that are defined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself.  Compliance with prison grievance procedures, therefore, is all that is required by the PLRA to \xe2\x80\x9cproperly exhaust.\xe2\x80\x9d  The level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.  As the MDOC\xe2\x80\x99s procedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have identified the benefits of exhaustion to include allowing a prison to address complaints about the program it administers before being subjected to suit, reducing litigation to the extent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and improving litigation that does occur by leading to the preparation of a useful record.  See <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x938); <em>Porter</em>, 534 U. S., at 524\xe2\x80\x93525.  The Sixth Circuit rule may promote early notice to those who might later be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement.  See <em>Johnson</em>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 522 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to alert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal notice to a particular official that he may be sued; the grievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates adversarial litigation\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x939, and n.\xc2\xa06 (collecting grievance procedures and noting that the majority do not require prisoners to identify specific individuals).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not determine whether the grievances filed by petitioners satisfied the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9cproper exhaustion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Woodford</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 11), but simply conclude that exhaustion is not <em>per se</em> inadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in the grievances.

The issue is whether the court should proceed with the exhausted claims, or instead\xe2\x80\x94as the Sixth Circuit has held\xe2\x80\x94dismiss the entire action if any one claim is not properly exhausted.

Section 1997e(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d unless administrative procedures are exhausted.  Respondents argue that if Congress intended courts to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the balance of the lawsuit, the word \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d would have been used in this provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This statutory phrasing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is boilerplate language.  There are many instances in the Federal Code where similar language is used, but such language has not been thought to lead to the dismissal of an entire action if a single claim fails to meet the pertinent standards.  Statutes of limitations, for example, are often introduced by a variant of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cno action shall be brought,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Beach</em> v. <em>Ocwen Fed. Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/410/index.html">523 U. S. 410</a>, 416 (1998); 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71030(g) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), but we have never heard of an entire complaint being thrown out simply because one of several discrete claims was barred by the statute of limitations, and it is hard to imagine what purpose such a rule would serve.  The same is true with respect to other uses of the \xe2\x80\x9cno action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d phrasing.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</em> v. <em>Federal Emergency Management Agency</em>, 126 F. 3d 461, 471 (CA3 1997) (dismissing only claims that fail to comply with the citizen suit notification requirement of 16 U.

In <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a>, 522 (1982), we held that \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d habeas petitions\xe2\x80\x94containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims\xe2\x80\x94cannot be adjudicated.  This total exhaustion rule applied in habeas was initially derived from considerations of \xe2\x80\x9ccomity and federalism,\xe2\x80\x9d not any statutory command.  <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U. S. 269</a>, 273 (2005); <em>id.,</em> at 274 (noting that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cpreserved <em>Lundy</em>\xe2\x80\x99s total exhaustion requirement\xe2\x80\x9d in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A)).  Separate claims in a single habeas petition generally seek the same relief from custody, and success on one is often as good as success on another.  In such a case it makes sense to require exhaustion of all claims in state court before allowing the federal action to proceed.  A typical PLRA suit with multiple claims, on the other hand, may combine a wide variety of discrete complaints, about interactions with guards, prison conditions, generally applicable rules, and so on, seeking different relief on each claim.  There is no reason failure to exhaust on one necessarily affects any other.  In any event, even if the habeas total exhaustion rule is pertinent, it does not in fact depart from the usual practice\xe2\x80\x94as we recently held, a court presented with a mixed habeas petition \xe2\x80\x9cshould allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rhines</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 278.  This is the opposite of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule that respondents argue against.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a) to contain a total exhaustion rule is bolstered by the fact that other sections of the PLRA distinguish between actions and claims.  Section 1997e(c)(1), for example, provides that a court shall dismiss an <em>action</em> for one of four enumerated deficiencies, while \xc2\xa71997e(c)(2) allows a court to dismiss a <em>claim</em> for one of these reasons without first determining whether the claim is exhausted.  Similarly, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71915A(b) directs district courts to dismiss \xe2\x80\x9cthe complaint, or any portion of the complaint\xe2\x80\x9d before docketing under certain circumstances.  This demonstrates that Congress knew how to differentiate between the entire action and particular claims when it wanted to, and suggests that its use of \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(a) should be given effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the interpretation respondents advocate creates its own inconsistencies.  Section 1997e(e) contains similar language, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o \xe2\x80\xa6 action may be brought \xe2\x80\xa6 for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury,\xe2\x80\x9d yet respondents cite no case interpreting this provision to require dismissal of the entire lawsuit if only one claim does not comply, and again we see little reason for such an approach.  Accord, <em>Cassidy</em> v. <em>Indiana Dept. of Corrections</em>, 199 F.\xc2\xa03d 374, 376\xe2\x80\x93377 (CA7 2000) (dismissing only the portions of the complaint barred by \xc2\xa71997e(e)); see also <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Ollis</em>, 230 F.\xc2\xa03d 1361 (CA6 2000) (unpublished table decision) (same).  Interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cno action shall be brought\xe2\x80\x9d to require dismissal of the entire case under \xc2\xa71997e(a) but not \xc2\xa71997e(e) would contravene our normal rules of statutory construction.  <em>National Credit Union Admin.</em> v. <em>First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/479/index.html">522 U. S. 479</a>, 501\xe2\x80\x93502 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In pressing the total exhaustion argument, respondents also marshal the policy and purpose underlying the PLRA\xe2\x80\x94this time in a supporting rather than lead role.  The invigorated exhaustion requirement is a \xe2\x80\x9ccenterpiece\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute, <em>Woodford</em>, 548 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932), and if the exhaustion requirement of \xc2\xa71997e(a) is not effectuated by a total exhaustion rule, they argue, inmates will have little incentive to ensure that they have exhausted all available administrative remedies before proceeding to court.  The PLRA mandated early judicial screening to reduce the burden of prisoner litigation on the courts; a total exhaustion rule allows courts promptly to dismiss an action upon identifying an unexhausted claim.  The alternative approach turns judges into editors of prisoner complaints, rather than creating an incentive for prisoners to exhaust properly.  See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>County of Bernalillo</em>, 365 F.\xc2\xa03d 1181, 1190 (CA10 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded by these policy arguments.  In fact, the effect of a total exhaustion rule could be that inmates will file various claims in separate suits, to avoid the possibility of an unexhausted claim tainting the others.  That would certainly not comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate suits.  Additionally, district judges who delve into a prisoner complaint only to realize it contains an unexhausted claim, requiring dismissal of the entire complaint under the total exhaustion rule, will often have to begin the process all over again when the prisoner refiles.  In light of typically short prison grievance time limits, prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 refiled complaints will often be identical to what the district court would have considered had it simply dismissed unexhausted claims as it encountered them and proceeded with the exhausted ones.  Perhaps filing fees and concerns about the applicability of the \xe2\x80\x9cthree strikes\xe2\x80\x9d rule, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71915(g), would mitigate these effects, but the debate about consequences is close enough that there is no clear reason to depart from the more typical claim-by-claim approach.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not insensitive to the challenges faced by the lower federal courts in managing their dockets and attempting to separate, when it comes to prisoner suits, not so much wheat from chaff as needles from haystacks.
