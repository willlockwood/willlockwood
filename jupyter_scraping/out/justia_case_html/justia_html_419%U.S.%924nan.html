The necessity that one be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (In re Winship, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U.S. 358</a> (1970)) and the right to a speedy trial (Barker v. Wingo, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/514/case.html">407 U.S. 514</a>d 101 (1972)) are likewise involved. Ohio seems to recognize the need to accommodate constitutional rights other than the three mentioned in Boykin, since its own supreme court has held that a trial judge must advise the defendant of his right to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before accepting a guilty plea. State v. Griffey, 35 Ohio St.2d 101, 298 N. E.2d 603 (1973). Yet the record here fails even to meet this standard. </p><p> Since the Court has now held that a guilty plea forecloses constitutional challenge to the process that brought the defendant to the bar, Tollett v. Henderson, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/258/case.html">411 U.S. 258</a>, 36 L.E.2d 235 ( 1973), strict scrutiny over the standards for acceptance of the plea becomes all the more imperative. I would grant certiorari.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
