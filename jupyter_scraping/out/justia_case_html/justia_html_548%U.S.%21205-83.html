This Court then decided <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, holding that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 490, and<em> Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, clarifying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d id.,</em> at 303.  Because the trial court could not have subjected respondent to a firearm enhancement based only on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that respondent was armed with a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d the State conceded a Sixth Amendment <em>Blakely</em> violation before the Washington Supreme Court, but urged the court to find the <em>Blakely </em>error harmless.  In vacating respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence and remanding for sentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement, however, the court declared <em>Blakely</em> error to be \xe2\x80\x9cstructural error,\xe2\x80\x9d which will always invalidate a conviction under <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/275/index.html">508 U. S. 275</a>, 279.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that this Court lacks power to reverse because the Washington Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment rested on adequate and independent state-law grounds is rejected.  It is far from clear that respondent is correct that at the time of his conviction, state law provided no procedure for a jury to determine whether a defendant was armed with a firearm, so that it is impossible to conduct harmless-error analysis on the Blakely</em> error in his case.  The correctness of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, however, is not determinative of the question the State Supreme Court decided and on which this Court granted review, <em>i.e.</em>, whether <em>Blakely </em>error can ever be deemed harmless.  If respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading of Washington law is correct, that merely suggests that he will be able to demonstrate that the <em>Blakely </em>violation <em>in this particular case </em>was not harmless.  See <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/index.html">386 U. S. 18</a>, 24.  But it does not mean that <em>Blakely</em> error\xe2\x80\x94which is of the same nature, whether it involves a fact that state law permits to be submitted to the jury or not\xe2\x80\x94is structural, or that this Court is precluded from deciding that question.  Thus, the Court need not resolve this open question of Washington law.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Failure to submit a sentencing factor to the jury is not \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d error.  If a criminal defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that most constitutional errors are subject to harmless-error analysis.  <em>E.g., Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 8.  Only in rare cases has this Court ruled an error \xe2\x80\x9cstructural,\xe2\x80\x9d thus requiring automatic reversal.  In <em>Neder</em>, the Court held that failure to submit an element of an offense to the jury\xe2\x80\x94there, the materiality of false statements as an element of the federal crimes of filing a false income tax return, mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, see <em>id.,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xe2\x80\x94is not structural, but is subject to <em>Chapman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error rule<em>, id.,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x9320.  This case is indistinguishable from <em>Neder</em>.  <em>Apprendi </em>makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny possible distinction between an \xe2\x80\x98element\xe2\x80\x99 of a felony \xe2\x80\xa6 and a \xe2\x80\x98sentencing factor\xe2\x80\x99 was unknown \xe2\x80\xa6 during the years surrounding our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 478.  Accordingly, the Court has treated sentencing factors, like elements, as facts that have to be tried to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.,</em> at 483\xe2\x80\x93484.  The only difference between this case and <em>Neder</em> is that there the prosecution failed to prove the materiality element beyond a reasonable doubt, while here the prosecution failed to prove the \xe2\x80\x9carmed with a firearm\xe2\x80\x9d sentencing factor beyond a reasonable doubt.  Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be reconciled with <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that elements and sentencing factors must be treated the same.  Respondent attempts unpersuasively to distinguish <em>Neder</em> on the ground that the jury there returned a guilty verdict on the offenses for which the defendant was sentenced, whereas here the jury returned a guilty verdict only on the offense of second-degree assault, and an affirmative answer to the sentencing question whether respondent was armed with a deadly weapon.  Because Neder\xe2\x80\x99s jury did not find him guilty of each of the elements of the offenses with which he was charged, its verdict is no more fairly described as a complete finding of guilt than is the verdict here.

The trial court applied a 3-year firearm enhancement to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence based on its own factual findings, in violation of <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a> (2004).  On appeal, the Supreme Court of Washington vacated the sentence, concluding that <em>Blakely </em>violations can never be harmless.  We granted certiorari to review this conclusion, 546 U. S. ___ (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 18, 1999, respondent fought with his wife, Amy Recuenco.  After screaming at her and smashing their stove, he threatened her with a gun.  Based on this incident, the State of Washington charged respondent with assault in the second degree, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cintentiona[l] assault . . . with a deadly weapon, to-wit: a handgun.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3.  Defense counsel proposed, and the court accepted, a special verdict form that directed the jury to make a specific finding whether respondent was \xe2\x80\x9carmed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 13.  A \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm\xe2\x80\x9d qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under Washington law.  Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa79A.04.110(6) (2006).  But nothing in the verdict form specifically required the jury to find that respondent had engaged in assault with a \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to any other kind of \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of assault in the second degree, and answered the special verdict question in the affirmative.  App. 10, 13.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At sentencing, the State sought the low end of the standard range sentence for assault in the second degree (three months).  It also sought a mandatory 3-year enhancement because respondent was armed with a \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79.94A.533(3)(b), rather than requesting the 1-year enhancement that would attend the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that respondent was armed with a deadly weapon, \xc2\xa79.94A.533(4)(b).  The trial court concluded that respondent satisfied the condition for the firearm enhancement, and accordingly imposed a total sentence of 39 months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the Supreme Court of Washington heard respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, we decided <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and<em> Blakely</em>, <em>supra.</em>  In <em>Apprendi</em>, we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 490.  In <em>Blakely</em>, we clarified that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original).  Because the trial court in this case could not have subjected respondent to a firearm enhancement based only on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that respondent was armed with a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d the State conceded before the Supreme Court of Washington that a Sixth Amendment violation occurred under <em>Blakely</em>.  154 Wash. 2d 156, 162\xe2\x80\x93164, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d 188, 191 (2005).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State urged the Supreme Court of Washington to find the <em>Blakely </em>error harmless and, accordingly, to affirm the sentence.  In <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Hughes</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 118, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d 192 (2005), however, decided the same day as the present case, the Supreme Court of Washington declared <em>Blakely </em>error to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98structural\xe2\x80\x99 erro[r]\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98will always invalidate the conviction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 142, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d 205 (quoting <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/275/index.html"></a><a href="/us/508/275/index.html">508 U. S. 275</a>, 279 (1993)).  As a result, the court refused to apply harmless-error analysis to the <em>Blakely </em>error infecting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  Instead, it vacated his sentence and remanded for sentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement. 154 Wash. 2d, at 164, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 192.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before reaching the merits, we must address respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that we are without power to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington because that judgment rested on adequate and independent state-law grounds.  Respondent claims that at the time of his conviction, Washington state law provided no procedure for a jury to determine whether a defendant was armed with a firearm.  Therefore, he contends, it is impossible to conduct harmless-error analysis on the <em>Blakely </em>error in his case.  Respondent bases his position on <em>Hughes</em>, in which the Supreme Court of Washington refused to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a procedure to empanel juries on remand to find aggravating factors because the legislature did not provide such a procedure and, instead, explicitly assigned such findings to the trial court.\xe2\x80\x9d  154 Wash. 2d, at 151, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 209.  Respondent contends that, likewise, the Washington Legislature provided no procedure by which a jury could decide at trial whether a defendant was armed with a firearm, as opposed to a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is far from clear that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Washington law is correct.  See <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Pharr</em>, 131 Wn. App. 119, 124-125, 126 P.\xc2\xa03d 66, 69 (2006) (affirming the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of a firearm enhancement when the jury\xe2\x80\x99s special verdict reflected a finding that the defendant was armed with a firearm).  In <em>Hughes</em>, the Supreme Court of Washington carefully avoided reaching the conclusion respondent now advocates, instead expressly recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e are presented only with the question of the appropriate remedy on <em>remand</em>\xe2\x80\x94we do not decide here whether juries may be given special verdict forms or interrogatories to determine aggravating factors at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 149, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 208.  Accordingly, <em>Hughes</em> does not appear to foreclose the possibility that an error could be found harmless because the jury which convicted the defendant would have concluded, if given the opportunity, that a defendant was armed with a firearm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The correctness of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Washington law, however, is not determinative of the question that the Supreme Court of Washington decided and on which we granted review, <em>i.e.</em>, whether <em>Blakely </em>error can ever be deemed harmless.  If respondent is correct that Washington law does not provide for a procedure by which his jury could have made a finding pertaining to his possession of a firearm, that merely suggests that respondent will be able to demonstrate that the <em>Blakely </em>violation <em>in this particular case </em>was not harmless.  See <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/18/index.html">386 U. S. 18</a>, 24 (1967).  But that does not mean that <em>Blakely</em> error\xe2\x80\x94which is of the same nature, whether it involves a fact that state law permits to be submitted to the jury or not\xe2\x80\x94is structural, or that we are precluded from deciding that question.  Thus, we need not resolve this open question of Washington law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have repeatedly recognized that the commission of a constitutional error at trial alone does not entitle a defendant to automatic reversal.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98most constitutional errors can be harmless.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (1999) (quoting <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U. S. 279</a>, 306 (1991)).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other [constitutional] errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless-error analysis.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 8 (quoting <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Clark</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/570/index.html">478 U. S. 570</a>, 579 (1986)).  Only in rare cases has this Court held that an error is structural, and thus requires automatic reversal.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In such cases, the error \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recently considered whether an error similar to that which occurred here was structural in <em>Neder,</em> <em>supra.</em>  Neder was charged with mail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341; wire fraud, in violation of \xc2\xa71343; bank fraud, in violation of \xc2\xa71344; and filing a false income tax return, in violation of 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77206(1).  527 U. S., at 6. <em> </em>At Neder\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the District Court instructed the jury that it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98need not consider\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the materiality of any false statements to convict Neder of the tax offenses or bank fraud, because materiality \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is not a question for the jury to decide.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court also failed to include materiality as an element of the offenses of mail fraud and wire fraud.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We determined that the District Court erred because under <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gaudin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/506/index.html">515 U. S. 506</a> (1995), materiality is an element of the tax offense that must be found by the jury.  We further determined that materiality is an element of the mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes, and thus must be submitted to the jury to support conviction of those crimes as well.  <em>Neder</em>, 527 U. S., at 20.  We nonetheless held that harmless-error analysis applied to these errors, because \xe2\x80\x9can instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <em>necessarily</em> render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 9.

We agree.  Our decision in <em>Apprendi </em>makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny possible distinction between an \xe2\x80\x98element\xe2\x80\x99 of a felony offense and a \xe2\x80\x98sentencing factor\xe2\x80\x99 was unknown to the practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court as it existed during the years surrounding our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U.

Accordingly, we have treated sentencing factors, like elements, as facts that have to be tried to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id</em>., at 483\xe2\x80\x93484.  The only difference between this case and <em>Neder</em> is that in <em>Neder</em>, the prosecution failed to prove the element of materiality to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, while here the prosecution failed to prove the sentencing factor of \xe2\x80\x9carmed with a firearm\xe2\x80\x9d to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be reconciled with our recognition in <em>Apprendi</em> that elements and sentencing factors must be treated the same for Sixth Amendment purposes.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent attempts to distinguish <em>Neder </em>on the ground that, in that case, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the offense for which the defendant was sentenced.  Here, in contrast, the jury returned a guilty verdict only on the offense of assault in the second degree, and an affirmative answer to the sentencing question whether respondent was armed with a deadly weapon.  Accordingly, respondent argues, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s action in his case was the equivalent of a directed verdict of guilt on an offense (assault in the second degree while armed with a firearm) greater than the one for which the jury convicted him (assault in the second degree while armed with any deadly weapon).  Rather than asking whether the jury would have returned the same verdict absent the error, as in <em>Neder</em>, respondent contends that applying harmless-error analysis here would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hypothesize a guilty verdict that [was] never in fact rendered,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the jury-trial guarantee.  Brief for Respondent at 27 (quoting <em>Sullivan</em>, 508 U. S., at 279).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find this distinction unpersuasive.  Certainly, in <em>Neder</em>, the jury purported to have convicted the defendant of the crimes with which he was charged and for which he was sentenced.  However, the jury was precluded \xe2\x80\x9cfrom making a finding on the <em>actual </em>element of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 10.  Because Neder\xe2\x80\x99s jury did not find him guilty of each of the elements of the offenses with which he was charged, its verdict is no more fairly described as a complete finding of guilt of the crimes for which the defendant was sentenced than is the verdict here.  See <em>id.,</em> at 31 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ince all crimes require proof of more than one element to establish guilt . . . it follows that trial by jury means determination by a jury that <em>all elements </em>were proved.  The Court does not contest this\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>Put another way, we concluded that the error in <em>Neder</em> was subject to harmless-error analysis, even though the District Court there not only failed to submit the question of materiality to the jury, but also mistakenly concluded that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict was a complete verdict of guilt on the charges and imposed sentence accordingly.  Thus, in order to find for respondent, we would have to conclude that harmless-error analysis would apply if Washington had a crime labeled \xe2\x80\x9cassault in the second degree while armed with a firearm,\xe2\x80\x9d and the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it was not required to find a deadly weapon or a firearm to convict, while harmless error does not apply in the present case.

Ironically, the issue in this case is not whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional rights were violated\xe2\x80\x94that is admitted\xe2\x80\x94it is whether the Washington Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s chosen remedy for the violation is mandated by federal law.  As the discussion in Part II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion demonstrates, whether we even have jurisdiction to decide that question is not entirely clear.  But even if our expansionist post-<em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long </em>jurisprudence supports our jurisdiction to review the decision below, see <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U.

The Washington Supreme Court can, of course, reinstate the same judgment on remand, either for the reasons discussed in Part II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, see <em>ante</em>, at 4, and n.\xc2\xa01, or because that court chooses, as a matter of state law, to adhere to its view that the proper remedy for <em>Blakely </em>errors, see <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U.

The information charged Recuenco with assault in the second degree, and further alleged that at the time of the assault, he was armed with a deadly weapon.  App. 3.  Without enhancement, the assault charge Recuenco faced carried a sentence of 3 to 9 months, <em>id.</em>, at 15; Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79.94A.510, 9A.36.021(1)(c) (2004); the deadly weapon enhancement added one mandatory year to that sentence, \xc2\xa79.94A.533(4)(b).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The trial judge instructed the jury on both the assault charge and the deadly weapon enhancement.  App. 7, 8.  In connection with the enhancement, the judge gave the jurors a special verdict form and instructed them to answer \xe2\x80\x9cYes or No\xe2\x80\x9d to one question only: \xe2\x80\x9cWas the defendant \xe2\x80\xa6 armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 13.  The jury answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the deadly weapon Recuenco held was in fact a handgun, the prosecutor might have charged, as an alternative to the deadly weapon enhancement, that at the time of the assault, Recuenco was \xe2\x80\x9carmed with a firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  That enhancement would have added three mandatory years to the assault sentence.  \xc2\xa79.94A.533(3)(b).  The information charging Recuenco, however, did not allege the firearm enhancement.  The jury received no instruction on it and was given no special verdict form posing the question: Was the defendant armed with a firearm at the time of the commission of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree?  See 154 Wash. 2d 156, 160, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d 188, 190 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe jury was not asked to, and therefore did not, return a special verdict that Recuenco committed the assault while armed with a firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor not only failed to charge Recuenco with assault while armed with a firearm and to request a special verdict tied to the firearm enhancement.  He also informed the court, after the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict and in response to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion to vacate: \xe2\x80\x9cThe method under which the state is alleging and the jury found the assaul[t] committed was by use of a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 35.  Leaving no doubt, the prosecutor further clarified: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the crime charged and the enhancement the state alleged, there is no elemen[t] of a firearm.  The element is assault with a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Recuenco was thus properly charged, tried, and convicted of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon.  It was a solid case; no gap was left to fill.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, at sentencing, the prosecutor requested, and the trial judge imposed, a three-year mandatory enhancement for use of a firearm.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Recuenco objected to imposition of the firearm enhancement \xe2\x80\x9cwithout notice \xe2\x80\xa6 and a jury finding.\xe2\x80\x9d  154 Wash. 2d, at 161, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 190.  Determining that there was no warrant for elevation of the charge once the trial was over, the Washington Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cremand[ed] for resentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement which is supported by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s special verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 164, 110 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 192.  I would affirm that judgment.  No error marred the case presented at trial.  The prosecutor charged, and the jury found Recuenco guilty of, a complete and clearly delineated offense: \xe2\x80\x9cassault in the second degree, being armed with a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine was not designed to allow dislodgment of that error-free jury determination.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Under Washington law and practice, assault with a deadly weapon and assault with a firearm are discrete charges, attended by discrete instructions.  As the Court observes, <em>ante</em>, at 2, a charge of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon, \xc2\xa79.94A.533(4)(b), subjects a defendant to an additional year in prison, and a charge of second-degree assault while armed with a firearm, \xc2\xa79.94A.533(3)(b), calls for an additional term of three years.  \xe2\x80\x9cDeadly weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington law provides, encompasses any \xe2\x80\x9cimplement or instrument which has the capacity to inflict death and from the manner in which it is used, is likely to produce or may easily and readily produce death,\xe2\x80\x9d including, <em>inter alia</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cpistol, revolver, or any other firearm.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79.94A.602.  \xe2\x80\x9cFirearm\xe2\x80\x9d is defined, more particularly, to mean \xe2\x80\x9ca weapon or device from which a projectile or projectiles may be fired by an explosive such as gunpowder.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79.41.010(1).
