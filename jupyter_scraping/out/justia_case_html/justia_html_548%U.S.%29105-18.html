S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  The District Court granted their motion in part.  Affirming, the Second Circuit noted that, under <em>Crawford Fitting Co.</em> v. <em>J. T.

S. 83</a>, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory authority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee Report relating to \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in <em>Casey</em> referencing that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause.  While Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a State\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of such funds must be set out \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17.  Fund recipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily and knowingly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>and States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are \xe2\x80\x9cunaware\xe2\x80\x9d or which they are \xe2\x80\x9cunable to ascertain,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA furnishes clear notice regarding expert fees.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court begins with the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s text, for if its \xe2\x80\x9clanguage is plain,\xe2\x80\x9d the courts\xe2\x80\x99 function \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cis to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/1/index.html">530 U. S. 1</a>, 6.  While \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the services of experts.  \xe2\x80\x9cCosts\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art that does not generally include expert fees.  The use of \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d strongly suggests that \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provision making States liable for all expenses.  Moreover, \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d but that it may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cas part of the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  This language simply adds reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the list of recoverable costs set out in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71920, the general statute covering taxation of costs, which is strictly limited by \xc2\xa71821.  Thus, \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s text does not authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause.  Other IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction.  Of little significance here is a provision in the Handicapped Children\xe2\x80\x99s Protection Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no mention of consultants or experts or their fees.  And the fact that the provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these consultants.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Crawford Fitting Co.</em> and <em>Casey</em> strongly reinforce the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.  <em>Crawford Fitting Co.</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning supports the conclusion that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), like \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71920.  This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recognized in <em>Crawford Fitting Co.,</em> that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute \xe2\x80\x9crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S., at 445.  The conclusion that the IDEA does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dramatically by <em>Casey</em>, where the Court held that 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, a fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award expert fees to a prevailing party.  482 U. S., at 102.  The Second Circuit misunderstood the meaning of the <em>Casey</em> footnote on which it relied.  That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set out the correct interpretation of \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear notice required under the Spending Clause.  Its thrust was simply that \xe2\x80\x9cattorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, is generally not understood as encompassing expert fees.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 additional arguments are unpersuasive.  The IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s goals of \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents\xe2\x80\x99 right to challenge adverse school decisions are too general to provide much support for their reading of the IDEA.  And the IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history is insufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelmingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  We granted certiorari to decide whether this fee-shifting provision authorizes prevailing parents to recover fees for services rendered by experts in IDEA actions.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents Pearl and Theodore Murphy filed an action under the IDEA on behalf of their son, Joseph Murphy, seeking to require petitioner Arlington Central School District Board of Education to pay for their son\xe2\x80\x99s private school tuition for specified school years.  Respondents prevailed in the District Court, 86 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY 2000), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 297 F.\xc2\xa03d 195 (2002).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As prevailing parents, respondents then sought $29,350 in fees for the services of an educational consultant, Marilyn Arons, who assisted respondents throughout the IDEA proceedings.  The District Court granted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 request in part.  It held that only the value of Arons\xe2\x80\x99 time spent between the hearing request and the ruling in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 favor could properly be considered charges incurred in an \xe2\x80\x9caction or proceeding brought\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act, see 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  2003 WL 21694398, *9 (SDNY, July 22, 2003).  This reduced the maximum recovery to $8,650.  The District Court also held that Arons, a nonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on expert consulting services, not for time spent on legal representation, <em>id.,</em> at *4, but it concluded that all the relevant time could be characterized as falling within the compensable category, and thus allowed compensation for the full $8,650, <em>id.,</em> at *10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  402 F.\xc2\xa03d 332 (2005).  Acknowledging that other Circuits had taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to and did authorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 336.  The court began by discussing two decisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not be recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-shifting provisions.  See<em> Crawford Fitting Co.</em> v. <em>J. T. Gibbons, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/437/index.html">482 U. S. 437</a> (1987) (interpreting Fed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 (1988 ed.)).  According to these decisions, the court noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read to permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98explicit statutory authority\xe2\x80\x99 indicating that Congress intended for that sort of fee-shifting.\xe2\x80\x9d  402 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a statement in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote in <em>Casey</em> that made reference to that Report.  402 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (citing H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93687, p.\xc2\xa05 (1986)).  Based on these authorities, the court concluded that it was required to interpret the IDEA to authorize the award of the costs that prevailing parents incur in hiring experts.  402 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ____ (2006), to resolve the conflict among the Circuits with respect to whether Congress authorized the compensation of expert fees to prevailing parents in IDEA actions.  Compare <em>Goldring </em>v. <em>District of Columbia</em>, 416 F.\xc2\xa03d 70, 73\xe2\x80\x9377 (CADC 2005);<em> Neosho R-V School Dist. </em>v. <em>Clark ex rel.

We now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our resolution of the question presented in this case is guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause.  U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 1; see <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast</em>, 546 U. S. ____ (2005).  Like its statutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to assist state and local agencies in educating children with disabilities \xe2\x80\x9cand conditions such funding upon a State\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with extensive goals and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/176/index.html">458 U. S. 176</a>, 179 (1982).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Dole,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/203/index.html">483 U. S. 203</a>, 206\xe2\x80\x93207 (1987), but when Congress attaches conditions to a State\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be set out \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17 (1981); <em>Rowley, supra</em>, at 204, n.\xc2\xa026.  \xe2\x80\x9c[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore, to be bound by \xe2\x80\x9cfederally imposed conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d recipients of federal funds must accept them \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily and knowingly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst</em>, 451 U. S., at 17.  States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are \xe2\x80\x9cunaware\xe2\x80\x9d or which they are \xe2\x80\x9cunable to ascertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Thus, in the present case, we must view the IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those funds.  We must ask whether such a state official would clearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is the obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert fees.  In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice, we begin with the text.  We have \xe2\x80\x9cstated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Germain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/index.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (1992).  When the statutory \xe2\x80\x9clanguage is plain, the sole function of the courts\xe2\x80\x94at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\xe2\x80\x94is to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Hartford Underwriters Ins.

S. 470</a>, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d to the parents of \xe2\x80\x9ca child with a disability\xe2\x80\x9d who is the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  While this provision provides for an award of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d this provision does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for services rendered by experts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that we should interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage and that \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA proceedings, including expert costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument has multiple flaws.  For one thing, as the Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98costs\xe2\x80\x99 is a term of art that generally does not include expert fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  402 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336.  The use of this term of art, rather than a term such as \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses,\xe2\x80\x9d strongly suggests that \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provision that makes participating States liable for all expenses incurred by prevailing parents in connection with an IDEA case\xe2\x80\x94for example, travel and lodging expenses or lost wages due to time taken off from work.  Moreover, contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion, \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) does not say that a court may award \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d to prevailing parents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cas part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d to prevailing parents.  This language simply adds reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that prevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover.  This list of otherwise recoverable costs is obviously the list set out in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71920, the general statute governing the taxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of witness fees under \xc2\xa71920 is strictly limited by \xc2\xa71821, which authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per diem.  Thus, the text of 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required under the Spending Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same direction.  While authorizing the award of reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that are designed to ensure that such awards are indeed reasonable.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(C)\xe2\x80\x93(G).  The absence of any comparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly suggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized.  Moreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in \xc2\xa71415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference.  This provision, which generally requires that parents receive \xe2\x80\x9ca full explanation of the procedural safeguards\xe2\x80\x9d available under \xc2\xa71415 and refers expressly to \xe2\x80\x9cattorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d makes no mention of expert fees.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that their interpretation of \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handicapped Children\xe2\x80\x99s Protection Act of 1986 that required the General Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data, \xc2\xa74(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision), but this provision is of little significance for present purposes.  The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller General, acting through the GAO, to compile data on, among other things: \xe2\x80\x9c(A) the specific amount of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in IDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys and consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and expenses incurred by the parents and the State educational agency and local educational agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 797\xe2\x80\x93798.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position if it directed the GAO to compile data on awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring consultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.  Subparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or experts or their fees.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents.  Subparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel, including \xe2\x80\xa6 consultants,\xe2\x80\x9d says nothing about the award of fees to such consultants.  Just because Congress directed the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by consultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Congress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties for the fees billed by these consultants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents maintain that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 direction to the GAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate that the expenses for \xe2\x80\x98consultants\xe2\x80\x99 would be recoverable,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect.  There are many reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO to gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as costs.  Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might be useful in considering future procedural amendments (which might affect these costs) or a future amendment regarding fee shifting.  And, in fact, it is apparent that the GAO study provision covered expenses that could not be taxed as costs.  For example, the GAO was instructed to compile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys involved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the Act did not provide for the recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees by a prevailing state or local educational agency.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Similarly, the GAO was directed to compile data on \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses incurred by the parents,\xe2\x80\x9d not just those parents who prevail and are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the costs of experts or consultants.  Certainly the terms of the IDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed to attach such a condition to a State\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of IDEA funds.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA, but perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of the IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in C<em>rawford Fitting</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/437/index.html"></a><a href="/us/482/437/index.html">482 U. S. 437</a>, and <em>Casey, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/83/index.html">499 U. S. 83</a>.  In light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said that the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding liability for expert fees.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Crawford Fitting</em>, the Court rejected an argument very similar to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-ended reference to prevailing parents\xe2\x80\x99 expenses.  It was argued in <em>Crawford Fitting</em> that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), which provides for the award of \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d to a prevailing party, authorizes the award of costs not listed in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71821.  482 U. S.<em>,</em> at 439.  The Court held, however, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list set out in \xc2\xa71920.  <em>Id.,</em> at 441.  Because the recovery of witness fees, see \xc2\xa71920(3), is strictly limited by \xc2\xa71821, the Court observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d) would mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial repeal of those provisions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 442.  But, the Court warned, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has repealed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or any other provision not referring explicitly to witness fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 445.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasoning of <em>Crawford Fitting </em>strongly supports the conclusion that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d in 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71920.  This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recognized in <em>Crawford Fitting,</em> that no statute will be construed as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs unless the statute \xe2\x80\x9crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U. S., at 445; see also <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cabsent explicit statutory or contractual authorization for the taxation of the expenses of a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s witness as costs, federal courts are bound by the limitations set out in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71821 and \xc2\xa71920\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Casey </em>confirms even more dramatically that the<em> </em>IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees.  In <em>Casey</em>, as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, the relevant wording of which was virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B).  Compare <em>ibid.</em> (authorizing the award of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d to prevailing parents) with 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b) (1988 ed.) (permitting prevailing parties in certain civil rights actions to be awarded \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d).  We held that \xc2\xa71988 did not empower a district court to award expert fees to a prevailing party.  <em>Casey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 102.  To decide in favor of respondents here, we would have to interpret the virtually identical language in 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415 as having exactly the opposite meaning.  Indeed, we would have to go further and hold that the relevant language in the IDEA <em>unambiguously means</em> exactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 was held to mean in <em>Casey</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influenced by a <em>Casey</em> footnote, see 402 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (quoting 499 U. S., at 91\xe2\x80\x9392, n.\xc2\xa05), but the court misunderstood the footnote\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  The text accompanying the footnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting statutes, that the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d does not include expert fees.  <em>Id.</em>, at 88\xe2\x80\x9391.  In the footnote, we commented on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of the Conference Committee Report relating to 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), which stated: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The conferees intend[ed] that the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the \xe2\x80\xa6 case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 91\xe2\x80\x9392, n.\xc2\xa05 (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93687, at 5; ellipsis in original).  This statement, the footnote commented, was \xe2\x80\x9can apparent effort to <em>depart</em> from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 92, n.\xc2\xa05.  The footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set out the correct interpretation of \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B), much less that the Report was sufficient, despite the language of the statute, to provide the clear notice required under the Spending Clause.  The thrust of the footnote was simply that the term \xe2\x80\x9cattorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, is generally not understood as encompassing expert fees.  Thus, <em>Crawford Fitting</em> and <em>Casey</em> strongly reinforce the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents make several arguments that are not based on the text of the IDEA, but these arguments do not show that the IDEA provides clear notice regarding the award of expert fees.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that their interpretation of the IDEA furthers the Act\xe2\x80\x99s overarching goal of \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71400(d)(1)(A) as well as the goal of \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard[ing] the rights of parents to challenge school decisions that adversely affect their child.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 20.  These goals, however, are too general to provide much support for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the terms of the IDEA.  The IDEA obviously does not seek to promote these goals at the expense of all other considerations, including fiscal considerations.  Because the IDEA is not intended in all instances to further the broad goals identified by the respondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the goals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argument on the narrow question presented here.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress clearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated for expert fees.  They rely on the legislative history of \xc2\xa71415 and in particular on the following statement in the Conference Committee Report, discussed above: \xe2\x80\x9cThe conferees intend that the term \xe2\x80\x98attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x99 include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the \xe2\x80\xa6 case.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93687, at\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever weight this legislative history would merit in another context, it is not sufficient here.  Putting the legislative history aside, we see virtually no support for respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position.  Under these circumstances, where everything other than the legislative history overwhelming suggests that expert fees may not be recovered, the legislative history is simply not enough.  In a Spending Clause case, the key is not what a majority of the Members of both Houses intend but what the States are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of those funds.  Here, in the face of the unambiguous text of the IDEA and the reasoning in <em>Crawford Fitting</em> and <em>Casey</em>, we cannot say that the legislative history on which respondents rely is sufficient to provide the requisite fair notice.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because subparagraph (A) refers to both \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d awarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that statutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provision manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded certain \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d not included in the list of \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d set out in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumerated \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  This argument fails because, whatever expectation this language might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d other than \xe2\x80\x9ccosts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Recognizing this, respondents argue not that they are entitled to recover \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d that are not \xe2\x80\x9ccosts,\xe2\x80\x9d but that expert fees <em>are</em> recoverable \xe2\x80\x9ccosts.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a result, the reference to awards of both \xe2\x80\x9cexpenses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d does not support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position.

The Court extracts from <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/index.html">451 U. S. 1</a>, 17 (1981), a \xe2\x80\x9cclear notice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, and deems it applicable in this case because Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue in <em>Pennhurst</em>, pursuant to the Spending Clause.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted.  <em>Pennhurst</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclear notice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement should not be unmoored from its context.

The controversy here is lower key: It concerns not the educational programs IDEA directs school districts to provide, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedies available against a noncomplying [district].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>; see <em>post</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to a Spending Clause derived \xe2\x80\x9cclear notice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 6, 8, 11, and n.\xc2\xa03, 12, are questionable on other grounds as well.  For one thing, IDEA was enacted not only pursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Spending Clause authority, but also pursuant to \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Robinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/index.html"></a><a href="/us/468/992/index.html">468 U.

Furthermore, no \xe2\x80\x9cclear notice\xe2\x80\x9d prop is needed in this case given the twin pillars on which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment securely rests.  First, as the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, the specific, attorneys\xe2\x80\x99-fees-oriented, provisions of IDEA, <em>i.e.</em>, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(G); \xc2\xa71415(d)(2)(L), \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmingly support the conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the costs of experts or consultants,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8.  Those provisions place controls on fees recoverable for attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 services, without mentioning costs parents might incur for other professional services and controls geared to those costs.  Second, as the Court develops, prior decisions closely in point \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly suppor[t],\xe2\x80\x9d even \xe2\x80\x9cconfir[m] \xe2\x80\xa6 dramatically,\xe2\x80\x9d today\xe2\x80\x99s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and does not authorize an award covering amounts paid or payable for the services of an educational consultant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (citing <em>Crawford Fitting Co.</em> v. <em>J.

Cf. \xc2\xa71415(i)(3)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(G); \xc2\xa71415(d)(2)(L) (listing only attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees, not expert or consulting fees, among the procedural safeguards about which school districts must inform parents). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, although I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale to the extent that it invokes a \xe2\x80\x9cclear notice\xe2\x80\x9d requirement tied to the Spending Clause, I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of IDEA\xe2\x80\x99s terms, <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, and of our decisions in <em>Crawford</em> and <em>Casey</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  Accordingly, I concur in part in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant statement from the Conference Report reads in its entirety: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe conferees intend that the term \xe2\x80\x98attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x99 include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian\xe2\x80\x99s case in the action or proceeding, as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating a case.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

They were altogether clear, however, that the purpose of the legislation was to \xe2\x80\x9creverse\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Robinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/index.html"></a><a href="/us/468/992/index.html">468 U. S. 992</a> (1984).  In <em>Smith</em>, the Court held that, under the statute as then designed, prevailing parents were not entitled to attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees.  See 132 Cong. Rec. 16823 (1986) (remarks of Sen. Weicker) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn adopting this legislation, we are rejecting the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Smith versus Robinson.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 16824 (remarks of Sen. Kerry) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis vital legislation reverses a U. S. Supreme Court decision Smith versus Robinson[.]\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 17608\xe2\x80\x9317609 (remarks of Rep.

Biaggi) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis legislation clearly supports the intent of Congress back in 1975 and corrects what I believe was a gross misinterpretation of the law.
