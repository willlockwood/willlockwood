Half of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the \xe2\x80\x9clodestar,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> the number of hours the attorneys and their employees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the community.  The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience to litigate this case.  Awarding fees of about $10.5\xc2\xa0million, the District Court found that the proposed hourly rates were \xe2\x80\x9cfair and reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d but that some of the entries on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were excessive.  The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 million, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The calculation of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee based on the lodestar may be increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary circumstances.

S. 789</a>, 801.  Although imperfect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that approximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case; and it is readily administrable, see, <em>e.g., Burlington</em> v. <em>Dague</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/557/index.html">505 U.

Pp.  5\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court has established six important rules that lead to today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  First, a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d fee is one that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case, see <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/546/index.html">478 U. S. 546</a>, 565, but that does not provide \xe2\x80\x9ca form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Second, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d presumption that the lodestar method yields a sufficient fee.  See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 564.  Third, the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may be awarded in \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances.  <em>E.g., id.,</em> at 565.  Fourth, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 566.  An enhancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation, such as the case\xe2\x80\x99s novelty and complexity, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Blum</em> v. <em>Stenson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/886/index.html">465 U. S. 886</a>, 898, or the quality of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance, <em>Delaware Valley, supra, </em>at 566.  Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Blum, </em>465  U. S., at 901.  Sixth, an applicant seeking an enhancement must produce \xe2\x80\x9cspecific evidence\xe2\x80\x9d supporting the award, <em>id.</em>, at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation.  The \xe2\x80\x9cstrong presumption\xe2\x80\x9d that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.  P. 9. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court treats the quality of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance and the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior attorney performance and not another factor, such as inferior performance by opposing counsel.  The circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation are \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Enhancements should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cadequate to attract competent counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blum, supra</em>, at 897.  First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately measure the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation.  This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar) or perhaps only a few similar factors.  In such a case, the trial judge should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ability to a prevailing market rate.  Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted.  In such cases, the enhancement amount must be calculated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest rate to the qualifying expense outlays.  Third, an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.  In such a case, the enhancement should be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional delay in expense reimbursement.  Enhancements are not appropriate on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common.  Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increasingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with a bonus for obtaining specified results.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The District Court did not provide proper justification for the 75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case.  It commented that the enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropriate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.  The court also emphasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount of the enhancement attributable to this factor.  Similarly, the court noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on \xc2\xa71988 for fees.  Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay.  And its reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 565.  Finally, insofar as the court relied on a comparison of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance in this case with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review.  While determining a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d is within the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s sound discretion under \xc2\xa71988, that discretion is not unlimited.  The judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, including any enhancement.

KENNY A.<br/>\n559 U.

But as we have also said in prior cases, there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified.  Because the District Court did not apply these standards, we reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents (plaintiffs below) are children in the Georgia foster-care system and their next friends.  They filed this class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care and named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and various state officials (petitioners in this case).  Claiming that deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties near Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation, where the parties entered into a consent decree, which the District Court approved.  The consent decree resolved all pending issues other than the fees that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys were entitled to receive under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents submitted a request for more than $14 million in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Half of that amount was based on their calculation of the lodestar\xe2\x80\x94roughly 30,000 hours multiplied by hourly rates of $200 to $495 for attorneys and $75 to $150 for non-attorneys.  In support of their fee request, respondents submitted affidavits asserting that these rates were within the range of prevailing market rates for legal services in the relevant market.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The other half of the amount that respondents sought represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results.  Affidavits submitted in support of this request claimed that the lodestar amount \xe2\x80\x9cwould be generally insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judgment, professional representation and experience\xe2\x80\x9d to litigate this case.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, App. 80.  Petitioners objected to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court awarded fees of approximately $10.5\xc2\xa0million.  See 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1296 (ND Ga. 2006).  The District Court found that the hourly rates proposed by respondents were \xe2\x80\x9cfair and reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1285, but that some of the entries on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many of the billing categories were excessive.  The court therefore cut the non-travel hours by 15% and halved the hourly rate for travel hours.  This resulted in a lodestar calculation of approximately $6 million.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding that the lodestar calculation did not take into account \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the fact that class counsel were required to advance case expenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no on[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel were not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being performed, and (3) the fact that class counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely contingent on the outcome of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1288.  The court stated that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys had exhibited \xe2\x80\x9ca higher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and professionalism \xe2\x80\xa6 than the Court has seen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1289.  The court also commented that the results obtained were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98extraordinary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and added that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]fter 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1290.<em> </em>The enhancement resulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  532 F. 3d 1209 (2008).  The panel held that the District Court had not abused its discretion by failing to make a larger reduction in the number of hours for which respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys sought reimbursement, but the panel commented that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have cut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter in the first instance\xe2\x80\x9d and added that the hourly rates approved by the District Court also \xe2\x80\x9cappear[ed] to be on the generous side.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1220, and n.\xc2\xa02.  On the question of the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with each judge writing a separate opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit precedent required that the decision of the District Court be affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opinions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in this case.  He concluded that the quality of the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 performance was \xe2\x80\x9cadequately accounted for \xe2\x80\x98either in determining the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id</em>., at 1225 (quoting <em>Pennsylvania </em>v.<em> Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/546/index.html">478 U. S. 546</a>, 565\xe2\x80\x93566 (1986) <em>(Delaware Valley I)</em>).  He found that an enhancement could not be justified based on delay in the recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and reimbursable expenses because such delay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  And he reasoned that the District Court had contravened our holding in <em>Burlington </em>v.<em> Dague</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/557/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/557/index.html">505 U. S. 557</a> (1992), when it relied on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the fact that class counsel\xe2\x80\x99s compensation was totally contingent upon prevailing in this action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  532 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1226, 1228 (quoting affidavit in support of fee request).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed with Judge Carnes\xe2\x80\x99 view that Eleventh Circuit precedent is inconsistent with our decisions.  Judge Hill also concurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the correctness of the prior Circuit precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of three judges.  See<em> </em>547 F. 3d 1319 (2008).  Judge Wilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina, filed an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing; and Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending, among other things, that the District Court, by basing the enhancement in large part on a comparison of the performance of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys with all of the unnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his professional career, had improperly rendered a decision that was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had essentially served as a witness in support of the enhancement.  <em>Id</em>., at 1326\xe2\x80\x931327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  556 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The general rule in our legal system is that each party must pay its own attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and expenses, see <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 429 (1983), but Congress enacted 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71988 in order to ensure that federal rights are adequately enforced.  Section 1988 provides that a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may recover \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Unfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress meant by a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d fee, and therefore the task of identifying an appropriate methodology for determining a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d fee was left for the courts.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One possible method was set out in <em>Johnson</em> v<em>. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.</em>, 488 F. 2d 714, 717\xe2\x80\x93719 (CA5 1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider in determining a reasonable fee.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  This method, however, \xe2\x80\x9cgave very little actual guidance to district courts.  Setting attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees by reference to a series of sometimes subjective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Delaware Valley I,\nsupra</em>, at 563.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by the Third Circuit in <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadelphia </em>v.<em> American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp</em>., 487 F.\xc2\xa02d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F.\xc2\xa02d 102 (1976), and \xe2\x80\x9cachieved dominance in the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d after our decision in <em>Hensley.</em> <em>Gisbrecht</em> v. <em>Barnhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/789/index.html">535 U. S. 789</a>, 801 (2002).  \xe2\x80\x9cSince that time, \xe2\x80\x98[t]he \xe2\x80\x9clodestar\xe2\x80\x9d figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 562).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has several important virtues.  First, in accordance with our understanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the lodestar looks to \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing market rates in the relevant community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blum</em> v.<em> Stenson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/886/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/886/index.html">465 U. S. 886</a>, 895 (1984).  Developed after the practice of hourly billing had become widespread, see <em>Gisbrecht</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 801, the lodestar method produces an award that <em>roughly</em> approximates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have received if he or she had been representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case.  Second, the lodestar method is readily administrable, see <em>Dague</em>, 505 U. S., at 566; see also <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</em> v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/598/index.html">532 U. S. 598</a>, 609 (2001); and unlike the <em>Johnson</em> approach, the lodestar calculation is \xe2\x80\x9cobjective,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hensley, supra</em>, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of trial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and produces reasonably predictable results.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting statutes have established six important rules that lead to our decision in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case.  See <em>Delaware Valley I</em>, 478 U. S., at 565  (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f plaintiffs \xe2\x80\xa6 find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable fee,\xe2\x80\x99 the purpose behind the fee-shifting statute has been satisfied\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Blum</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 897 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel, but that does not produce windfalls to attorneys\xe2\x80\x9d (ellipsis, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Section 1988\xe2\x80\x99s aim is to enforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide \xe2\x80\x9ca form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Delaware Valley I, supra</em>, at 565.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is presumptively sufficient to achieve this objective.  See <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562;<em> Delaware Valley I, supra</em>, at 565; <em>Blum, supra</em>, at 897; see also <em>Gisbrecht</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 801\xe2\x80\x93802.  Indeed, we have said that the presumption is a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d one.  <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562;<em> Delaware Valley I, supra</em>, at 565.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, although we have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12, 17, we have repeatedly said that enhancements may be awarded in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rare\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exceptional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances.  <em>Delaware Valley I, supra</em>, at 565; <em>Blum, supra</em>, at 897; <em>Hensley</em>, 461 U. S., at 435.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, we have noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Delaware Valley I, supra</em>, at 566, and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation, see <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 562\xe2\x80\x93563; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v<em>. Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/711/index.html">483 U. S. 711</a>, 726\xe2\x80\x93727 (1987) <em>(Delaware Valley II)</em> (plurality opinion); <em>Blum, </em>465 U. S., at 898.  We have thus held that the novelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as a ground for an enhancement because these factors \xe2\x80\x9cpresumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We have also held that the quality of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance generally should not be used to adjust the lodestar \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Delaware Valley I, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 566.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant.  <em>Dague</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 561; <em>Blum, </em>465 U. S., at 901\xe2\x80\x93902.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must produce \xe2\x80\x9cspecific evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that supports the award.  <em>Id.</em>, at 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on \xe2\x80\x9cevidence that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation\xe2\x80\x9d).  This requirement is essential if the lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues, <em>i.e.</em>, providing a calculation that is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation.  The lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances.  Instead, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong presumption\xe2\x80\x9d that the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presumption may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the quality of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance or the results obtained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an enhancement.  We treat these two factors as one.  When a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney achieves results that are more favorable than would have been predicted based on the governing law and the available evidence, the outcome may be attributable to superior performance and commitment of resources by plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.  Or the outcome may result from inferior performance by defense counsel, unanticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable rulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or simple luck.  Since none of these latter causes can justify an enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they are the result of superior attorney performance.  Thus, we need only consider whether superior attorney performance can justify an enhancement.  And in light of the principles derived from our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.  We conclude that there are a few such circumstances but that these circumstances are indeed \xe2\x80\x9crare\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d and require specific evidence that the lodestar\nfee would not have been \xe2\x80\x9cadequate to attract competent counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Blum</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 897 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This may occur if the hourly rate is determined by a formula that takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] or perhaps only a few similar factors.  In such a case, an enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in cases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes.  But in order to provide a calculation that is objective and reviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s ability to a prevailing market rate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted.  As Judge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to represent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay the attorney, the attorney presumably understands that no reimbursement is likely to be received until the successful resolution of the case, 532 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1227, and therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reimbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual cases.  In such exceptional cases, however, an enhancement may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement must be calculated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying outlays of expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.  An attorney who expects to be compensated under \xc2\xa71988 presumably understands that payment of fees will generally not come until the end of the case, if at all.  See<em> </em>532 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1227 (opinion of Carnes, J.).  Compensation for this delay is generally made \xe2\x80\x9ceither by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Missouri </em>v<em>. Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/274/index.html">491 U. S. 274</a>, 282 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But we do not rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the face of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is unjustifiably caused by the defense.  In such a case, however, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a method similar to that described above in connection with exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for \nexpenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant performance enhancements on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common.  As we have noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it provides a rough approximation of general billing practices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual, an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be found.  However, neither respondents nor their <em>amici</em> contend that that day has arrived.  Nor have they shown that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the general run of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are told that, under an increasingly popular arrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate but receive a bonus if certain specified results are obtained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an enhancement such as the one in this case.  Brief for Respondents 55\xe2\x80\x9357.  The analogy, however, is flawed.  An attorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to a <em>reduced</em> <em>hourly rate</em> in exchange for the opportunity to earn a performance bonus is in a position far different from an attorney in a \xc2\xa71988 case who is compensated at the <em>full prevailing rate</em> and then seeks a performance enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the litigation has concluded.  Reliance on these comparisons for the purposes of administering enhancements, therefore, is not appropriate.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case, the District Court did not provide proper justification for the large enhancement that it awarded.  The court increased the lodestar award by 75% but, as far as the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reveals, this figure appears to have been essentially arbitrary.  Why, for example, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the 100% increase that respondents sought?  And why 75% rather than 50% or 25% or 10%?</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court commented that the enhancement was the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary to reasonably compensate [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1290.  But the effect of the enhancement was to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than $866 per hour,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and the District Court did not point to anything in the record that shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and had to wait for reimbursement, <em>id., </em>at 1288, but the court did not calculate the amount of the enhancement that is attributable to this factor.  Similarly, the District Court noted that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the court did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the record that the delay here was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on \xc2\xa71988 for the payment of their fees or quantify the disparity.  Nor did the court provide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay.  And the court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding in <em>Dague</em>.  See 505 U. S., at 565.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a comparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the performance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the District Court did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review.  Needless to say, we do not question the sincerity of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s observations, and we are in no position to assess their accuracy.  But when a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impressionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method\xe2\x80\x94providing an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see <em>id., </em> at 566\xe2\x80\x94is undermined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Determining a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge, see<em> </em>42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 (permitting court, \xe2\x80\x9cin its discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d to award fees), but the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion is not unlimited.  It is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, including any award of an enhancement.  Unless such an explanation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible, and without such review, widely disparate awards may be made, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may appear to be influenced) by a judge\xe2\x80\x99s subjective opinion regarding particular attorneys or the importance of the case.  In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplating the possibility of settlement will have no way to estimate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge enhancement.  See <em>Marek </em>v.<em> Chesny, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/1/index.html">473 U. S. 1</a>, 7 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by making it possible for persons without means to bring suit to vindicate their rights.  But unjustified enhancements that serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s aim.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In many cases, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded under \xc2\xa71988 are not paid by the individuals responsible for the constitutional or statutory violations on which the judgment is based.  Instead, the fees are paid in effect by state and local taxpayers, and because state and local governments have limited budgets, money that is used to pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is money that cannot be used for programs that provide vital public services. Cf. <em>Horne</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, 557 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 after \xe2\x80\x9cachiev[ing] only limited success\xe2\x80\x9d litigating their clients\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims.  <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 431 (1983).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion resolving their claim for fees observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin some cases of <em>exceptional</em> success an enhanced award\xe2\x80\x9d of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71988 \xe2\x80\x9cmay be justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 435 (emphasis added).  That observation plainly was dicta, but one year later this Court relied on it to reject the \xe2\x80\x9cargument that an \xe2\x80\x98upward adjustment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the lodestar calculation \xe2\x80\x9cis never permissible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blum</em> v. <em>Stenson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/886/index.html">465 U. S. 886</a>, 897 (1984).  Yet \xe2\x80\x9cwe have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, and our jurisprudence since <em>Blum </em>has charted \xe2\x80\x9ca decisional arc that bends decidedly against enhancements,\xe2\x80\x9d 532 F.\xc2\xa03d 1209, 1221 (CA11 2008) (Carnes, J.).  See also <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court holds, consistent with <em>Hensley</em> and <em>Blum</em>, that a lodestar fee award under \xc2\xa71988 may be enhanced for attorney performance in a \xe2\x80\x9cfew\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances that \xe2\x80\x9care indeed \xe2\x80\x98rare\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98exceptional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  But careful readers will observe the precise limitations that the Court imposes on the availability of such enhancements.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312; see also <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t must be understood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).  These limitations preserve our prior cases and advance our attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees jurisprudence further along the decisional arc that Judge Carnes described.  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach and its conclusion because, as the Court emphasizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938,<em> </em>the lodestar calculation will in virtually every case already reflect all indicia of attorney performance relevant to a fee award.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963168">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF BREYER, J.<br/>\nPERDUE V.

The Court answers that question in the affirmative.  See <em>ante, </em>at 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have stated in previous cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary circumstances, and we reaffirm that rule\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>ante, </em>p.\xc2\xa0___ (Kennedy, J., concurring).  As our prior precedents make clear, the lodestar calculation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not end the [fee] inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d because there \xe2\x80\x9cremain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 434 (1983).  For that reason, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 9.  Instead, as the Court today reaffirms, when \xe2\x80\x9csuperior attorney performance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, leads to \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional success an enhanced award may be justified,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hensley supra,</em> at 435<em>;</em> see also <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/546/index.html">478 U.

I agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a question that is not presented, but that the Court obliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to consider nonetheless\xe2\x80\x94namely, whether the lower courts correctly determined <em>in this case </em>that exceptional circumstances justify a lodestar enhancement.  See Parts IV\xe2\x80\x93V, <em>ante;</em> see also <em>ante, </em>p.\xc2\xa0___ (Kennedy, J., concurring).  I would not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow question that we agreed to consider.  See 556 U. S. __ (2009) (limiting review to the first question presented); Pet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also <em>Glover</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/198/index.html">531 U. S. 198</a>, 205 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule \xe2\x80\xa6 we do not decide issues outside the questions presented \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed from the litigation underlying the fee determination, is properly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988 demands.  But even were I to engage in that inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement.  And\nI would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains, the basic question that must be resolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar is whether the lodestar calculation \xe2\x80\x9cadequately measure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvalue,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated\xe2\x80\x9d by his performance \xe2\x80\x9cduring the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 10.  While I understand the need for answering that question through the application of standards, I also believe that the answer inevitably involves an element of judgment.  Moreover, when reviewing a district court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to that question, an appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact that a district court is better situated to provide that answer.  For it is the district judge, and only the district judge, who will have read all of the motions filed in the case, witnessed the proceedings, and been able to evaluate the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 overall performance in light of the objectives, context, legal difficulty, and practical obstacles present in the case.  In a word, the district judge will have observed the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s true \xe2\x80\x9cvalue, <em>as demonstrated</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6<em> during the litigation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  By contrast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps lengthy record, will inevitably have less time and opportunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an exceptionally fine job.  And this Court is yet less suited to performing that inquiry.  Accordingly, determining whether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 13, and the function of appellate courts is to review that judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination for an abuse of such discretion.  See <em>Pierce</em> v. <em>Underwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/552/index.html">487 U. S. 552</a>, 571 (1988); see also <em>General Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Joiner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/136/index.html">522 U. S. 136</a>, 143 (1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]eference \xe2\x80\xa6 is the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case well illustrates why our tiered and functionally specialized judicial system places the task of determining an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award primarily in the district court\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers spent eight years investigating the underlying facts, developing the initial complaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out final relief.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket, with over 600 entries, consists of more than 18,000 pages.  Transcripts of hearings and depositions, along with other documents, have produced a record that fills 20 large boxes.  Neither we, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire record.  Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district judge who is aware of the many intangible matters that the written page cannot reflect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly be exhaustive.  But those portions of the record I have reviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals, that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when awarding an enhanced fee.  I reach this conclusion based on four considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, the record indicates that the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 objective in this case was unusually important and fully consistent with the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights statute, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  Moreover, the problem the attorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of skill and effort.  Specifically, these lawyers and their clients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its entire foster-care system\xe2\x80\x94a system that much in the record describes as well below the level of minimal constitutional acceptability.  The record contains investigative reports, mostly prepared by Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s own Office of the Child Advocate, which show, for example, the following:</p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">The State\xe2\x80\x99s foster-care system was unable to provide essential medical and mental health services; children consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hearing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to administer basic care and antibiotics.

The advocate noted that neither her investigative reports nor national news publicity (including a television program that highlighted a 5-year-old foster child\xe2\x80\x99s death from beatings)\nhad prompted corrective action by the State.  OCA 2001 Report 1, 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The advocate further stated that litigation was necessary to force reform.  <em>Id.,</em> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.

But the State did not grant the Child Advocate\xe2\x80\x99s office the litigating authority she sought.  See 2000 Ga. Laws p. 245, as codified, Ga.

They thereby assumed the role of \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98private attorney general\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by filling an enforcement void in the State\xe2\x80\x99s own legal system, a function \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress considered of the highest priority,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Newman</em> v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/index.html">390 U.

The plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual investigations beyond those which the child advocate had already conducted.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Record, Docs. 50\xe2\x80\x9352 (partially under seal).  They then filed suit.  And the State met the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 efforts with a host of complex procedural, as well as substantive, objections.  The State, for example, argued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate the shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might have approved the investigations, the State then removed the case to federal court; the State then sought protective orders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the shelters\xe2\x80\x99 staff; and, after losing its motions, the State delayed to the point where the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cwas forced to admonish [the] State Defendants for \xe2\x80\x98relying on technical legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay and hinder the discovery process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d. 1260, 1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4).  See also Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9310; Docs. 26, 28\xe2\x80\x9329, 44, 60.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing the motion on complex legal doctrines such as <em>Younger </em>abstention and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which the District Court found inapplicable.  218 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 277, 284\xe2\x80\x93290 (ND Ga. 2003).  See <em>Younger</em> v.<em> Harris, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html">401 U.

The State also opposed the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster care, but the District Court again rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  218 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D.<em>,</em> at 299\xe2\x80\x93302.  And, after that, the State filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Record, Docs. 243\xe2\x80\x93245, which plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys opposed in thorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits, see Docs. 254\xe2\x80\x93258, 260.  After losing that motion and eventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced protracted litigation as to who should be the mediator.  See Docs. 363\xe2\x80\x93364, 366, 369\xe2\x80\x93370, 373, 376, 380.  All told, in opposing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to have the foster-care system reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside counsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates, worked significantly more hours than that figure alone indicates) and tapped its own law department for an additional 5,200 hours of work.  454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1287.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third, </em>in the face of this opposition, the results obtained by the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys appear to have been exceptional.  The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the course of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the State will take in order to address the specific deficiencies of the sort that I described above.  See <em>id.,</em> at 1289; see also App. 92\xe2\x80\x93207 (consent decree).  And it establishes a reporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement authority.  See 454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1289.  As a result of the decree, the State agreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system, to the benefit of children in many different communities.  And informed observers have described the decree as having brought about significant positive results.

After 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive scale,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 1289\xe2\x80\x931290.</p>\n<p align="left">Based on these observations and on its assessment of the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 performance during the course of the litigation, the District Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence establishes that the quality of service rendered by class counsel . . . was far superior to what consumers of legal services in the legal marketplace \xe2\x80\xa6 could reasonably expect to receive for the rates used in the lodestar calculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1288.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the basis of what I have read, I believe that assessment was correct.  I recognize that the ordinary lodestar calculation yields a large fee award.  But by my assessment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an average hourly fee per attorney of $249.  See <em>id.,</em> at 1287 (lodestar calculation and attorney hours).  (The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reference to an hourly fee of $866, <em>ante,</em> at 12, refers to the rate associated with the <em>single highest</em> paid of the 17 attorneys under the <em>enhanced </em>fee, not the <em>average </em>hourly rate under the <em>lodestar</em>.  The lay reader should also bear in mind that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfee\xe2\x80\x9d is substantially greater than his \xe2\x80\x9cprofit,\xe2\x80\x9d given that attorneys must sometimes cover case-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000, see 454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine overhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their fees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law Firm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this group of attorneys\xe2\x80\x94whom the District Court described as extraordinary\xe2\x80\x94at a rate <em>lower </em>than the <em>average </em>rate charged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Georgia, where the average hourly rate is $268.  See <em>id.,</em> at 89.  Accordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge that some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this case.  See <em>ante, </em>at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the fact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case where \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of the work,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 13, n.\xc2\xa07, was performed by relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly, would be compensated by the lodestar \xe2\x80\x9cbelow the market average,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>) is all the more reason to think that their service rendered their outstanding performance worthy of an enhancement.  By comparison, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced award\xe2\x80\x94a special one-time adjustment unique to this exceptional case\xe2\x80\x94would compensate these attorneys, on this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435, which is comparable to the rates charged by the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading law firms on average on every occasion.  See Firm-by-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National Law Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p. S2 (listing 13 firms at which average hourly rate is between $400 and $510); J. Barnett, Certification Drag: The Opinion Puzzle and Other Transactional Curiosities, 33 Iowa J. Corp. L. 95, 110, n.\xc2\xa058 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThese numbers are probably an underestimate given that many of the highest-billing national law firms decline to take part in the National Law Journal Survey\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award is wholly consistent with the purpose of \xc2\xa71988, which was enacted to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel for prevailing parties [are] paid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee-paying client.\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

And they certainly make clear that it was neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion for the District Court to reach that conclusion.  Indeed, if the facts and circumstances that I have described are even roughly correct, then it is fair to ask: If this is not an exceptional case, what is?</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My disagreement with the Court is limited.  As I stated at the outset, we are in complete agreement with respect to the answer to the question presented: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n increase\xe2\x80\x9d to the lodestar \xe2\x80\x9cdue to superior performance and results\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis permitted in extraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 1.  Unlike Justice Thomas, I do not read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to \xe2\x80\x9cadvance our attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees jurisprudence further along the decisional arc\xe2\x80\x9d toward a point where enhancements are \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually\xe2\x80\x9d barred in all cases.  <em>Ante,</em> at 2 (concurring opinion).  Our prior cases make clear that enhancements are permitted in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exceptional\xe2\x80\x99 cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Delaware Valley, </em>478 U. S., at 565, where the attorney achieves \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional success,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley,</em> 461 U. S., at 435; see also <em>Blum,</em> 465 U. S., at 896\xe2\x80\x93901.  By definition, such exceptional circumstances occur only rarely.  See <em>ante, </em>p.\xc2\xa0___ (Kennedy, J., concurring).  I do not see how the Court could \xe2\x80\x9cadvance\xe2\x80\x9d our fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further discourage lodestar enhancements without overruling the precedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.  To the contrary, today the Court \xe2\x80\x9creaffirm[s]\xe2\x80\x9d those precedents, which allow enhancements for exceptional performance.  <em>Ante,</em> at 1.  And with respect to that central holding we are unanimous.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with respect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for the Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court from awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court provides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47.  But the majority and I do disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judgment below.  \xe2\x80\x9cA request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley</em>, 461 U. S., at 437.  Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate review.  See <em>id.,</em> at 455\xe2\x80\x93456 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  We did not grant certiorari in this case to consider the fact-intensive dispute over whether this is, in fact, an exceptional case that merits a lodestar enhancement.  The District Court has already resolved that question and the Court of Appeals affirmed its judgment, having found no abuse of discretion.  I would have been content to resolve no more than the question presented.  But, even were I to follow the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to say more, I would hold that the principles upon which we agree\xe2\x80\x94including the applicability of abuse-of-discretion review to a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s fee determination\xe2\x80\x94require us to affirm the judgment below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
