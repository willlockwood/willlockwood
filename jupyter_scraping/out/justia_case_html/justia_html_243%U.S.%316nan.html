JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>These cases were argued together, involved similar questions, and may be disposed of in a single opinion.  They were actions brought in the district court by the respective defendants in error against the United States under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 243 U. S. 318</a></p><p> the 20th paragraph of \xc2\xa7 24, Judicial Code (Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087), to recover compensation for the taking of lands and water rights by means of backwater resulting from the construction and maintenance by the government of certain locks and dams upon the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers, respectively, in the State of Kentucky, in aid of the navigation upon those rivers.</p>\n<p>In No. 84, the findings of the district court are, in substance, that at the time of the erection of Lock and Dam No. 21 in the Cumberland River, the plaintiff was the owner of 189 acres of land on Whiteoak Creek, a tributary of the Cumberland, not far distant from the river; that, by reason of the erection of the lock and dam, six and six-tenths acres of this land are subject to frequent overflows of water from the river, so as to depreciate it one half of its value, and a ford across Whiteoak Creek and a part of a pass-way are destroyed; that the six and six-tenths acres were worth $990, and the damage thereto was $495; that the damage to the land by the destruction of the ford was $500, and that plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of $995.  It may be supposed that Whiteoak Creek was not a navigable stream, but there is no finding on the subject.</p>\n<p>In No. 718, the findings are to the effect that, at the time of the erection by the government of Lock and Dam No. 12 in the Kentucky River, the plaintiffs, together with another person who was joined as a defendant, were the owners and in possession of a tract of land situate on Miller\'s Creek, a branch of the Kentucky, containing five and one-half acres, upon which there were a mill and a mill seat; that, by reason of the erection of the lock and dam, the mill no longer can be driven by water power; that the water above the lock and dam, when it is at pool stage, is about one foot below the crest of the milldam, and this prevents the drop in the current that is necessary to run </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 243 U. S. 319</a></p><p> the mill; that no part of the land or mill is overflowed or covered by pool stage of water, nor is the mill physically damaged thereby; that Miller\'s Creek is not a navigable stream; that the damages sustained by the owners of the mill, representing depreciation of the value of the mill property by cutting off the water power, amount to $1,500.</p>\n<p>Judgments were entered in favor of the respective landowners for the sums mentioned in the findings, together with interest and the costs of the suits, and the United States appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p>(1) A fundamental contention made in behalf of the government, and one that applies to both cases, is that the control by Congress, and the Secretary of War acting for it, over the navigation of the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers must also include control of their tributaries, and that, in order to improve navigation at the places mentioned in the findings, it was necessary to erect dams and back up the water, and the right to do this must include also the right to raise the water in the tributary streams.</p>\n<p>In passing upon this contention, we may assume, without, however, deciding, that the rights of defendants in error are no greater than if they had been riparian owners upon the rivers, instead of upon the tributary creeks.</p>\n<p>The states have authority to establish for themselves such rules of property as they may deem expedient with respect to the streams of water within their borders, both navigable and nonnavigable, and the ownership of the lands forming their beds and banks (<em>Barney v.

Morrison,</em> 53 Ky. 367; <em>Morrison v. Thurman,</em> 56 Ky. 249; <em>Goodin v. Kentucky Lumber Co.,</em> 90 Ky. 625; <em>Murray v. Preston,</em> 106 Ky. 561, 564; <em>Banks v. Frazier,</em> 111 Ky. 909, 912; <em>Ireland v.

Tibbits</em> (1836), 17 Wend. 571, where the decision was rested (pp. 609, 612, 624) upon the ground that the bed of the Mohawk River was the property of the state, the authority of the case having been limited accordingly by later decisions of the court of last resort of that state.  <em>Commissioners of Canal Fund v.

King,</em> 18 Barb. 277, 284, 35 N.Y. 454, 459, 461; <em>Chenango Bridge Co. v. Paige,</em> 83 N.Y. 178, 185; <em>Murray v. Preston,</em> 106 Ky. 561, 563; <em>Stuart v.

S. 323</a></p><p> That the test of navigability in fact should be applied to streams in their natural condition was in effect held in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/557/case.html">The Daniel Ball,</a></span></em> 10 Wall. 557 -- a case which turned upon the question whether Grand River, in the State of Michigan, was one of the "navigable waters of the United States" within the meaning of acts of Congress that regulated vessels carrying merchandise and passengers upon such waters.  Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, after showing that the tidal test was not applicable in this country, said (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/557/case.html#563">77 U. S. 563</a></span>):</p>\n<p>"A different test must therefore be applied to determine the navigability of our rivers, and that is found in their navigable capacity.  Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.  And they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water."</p>\n<p>The point was set forth more clearly in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/430/case.html">The Montello,</a></span></em> 20 Wall. 430, where the question was whether Fox River, in the State of Wisconsin, was a navigable water of the United States within the meaning of the acts of Congress.  There were rapids and falls in the river, but the obstructions caused by them had been removed by artificial means so as to furnish uninterrupted water communication for steam vessels of considerable capacity.  It was argued (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/430/case.html#440">87 U. S. 440</a></span>) that, although the river might now be considered a highway for commerce conducted in the ordinary modes, it was not so in its natural state, and therefore was not a navigable water of the United States within the purview of the <em>Daniel Ball</em> decision.  The Court, accepting navigability in the natural State of the river as the proper test, proceeded to show that, even before the improvements resulting in an unbroken navigation were undertaken, a large and successful interstate commerce had been carried on through this river by means of Durham boats, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 243 U. S. 324</a></p><p> which were vessels from 70 to 100 feet in length, with 12 feet beam and drawing, when loaded, from 2 to 2 1/2 feet of water.  The Court, by Mr. Justice Davis, declared (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/430/case.html#441">87 U. S. 441</a></span>) that it would be a narrow rule to hold that, in this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated by steam or sail vessels, it could not be treated as a public highway.</p>\n<p>"The capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true criterion of the navigability of a river, rather than the extent and manner of that use.  If it be capable in its natural state of being used for purposes of commerce, no matter in what mode the commerce may be conducted, it is navigable in fact, and becomes in law a public river or highway."</p>\n<p>And again (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/430/case.html#443">87 U. S. 443</a></span>):</p>\n<p>"There are but few of our fresh water rivers which did not originally present serious obstructions to an uninterrupted navigation.  In some cases, like the Fox River, they may be so great while they last as to prevent the use of the best instrumentalities for carrying on commerce, but the vital and essential point is whether the natural navigation of the river is such that it affords a channel for useful commerce.  If this be so, the river is navigable in fact, although its navigation may be encompassed with difficulties by reason of natural barriers, such as rapids and sand bars."</p>\n<p>Numerous decisions of state courts were cited as supporting this view, including some of those to which we have referred.</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/166/case.html">Pumpelly v.

For the improvement of the navigation of the Savannah River, certain dams and other obstructions were placed and maintained in its bed, with the result of raising the water above its natural height and backing it up against plaintiff\'s embankment upon the river and interfering with the drainage of their plantation.

And, assuming that riparian owners upon nonnavigable tributaries of navigable streams are subject to such inconveniences as may arise from the exercise of the common right of navigation, this in like manner must be limited to the natural right.  The findings make it clear that the dams in question, constructed by the government in the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers, respectively, are for raising the level of those streams along certain stretches by means of backwater so as to render them, to the extent of the raising, artificial canals instead of natural waterways.  In the language of engineering, the government has "canalized" the rivers.  We intimate no doubt of the power of the United States to carry out this kind of improvement.  Nor do we doubt that, upon the completion of the improvements, these rivers, the Cumberland because it is an avenue of communication between two states, the Kentucky and also the Cumberland because, in connection with the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, they furnish highways of commerce among many states (<em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/713/case.html">Gilman v.

In each of these, there was no direct invasion of the lands of the claimants, the damages were altogether consequential, and the right to compensation was denied on that ground.</p>\n<p>(2) It is contended in No. 84 that the damage to Cress\' land by the overflow of six and six-tenths acres, because it depreciated its value only to the extent of one half, does not measure up to a taking, but is only a "partial injury," for which the government is not liable.  The findings, however, render it plain that this is not a case of temporary flooding or of consequential injury, but a permanent condition resulting from the erection of the lock and dam, by which the land is "subject to frequent overflows of water from the river."  That overflowing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 243 U. S. 328</a></p><p> lands by permanent backwater is a direct invasion, amounting to a taking, is settled by <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/166/case.html">Pumpelly v.

S. 468</a></span>-470.  It is true that, in the <em>Pumpelly</em> case, there was an almost complete destruction, and in the <em>Lynah</em> case a complete destruction, of the value of the lands, while in the present case, the value is impaired to the extent of only one half.  But it is the character of the invasion, not the amount of damage resulting from it, so long as the damage is substantial, that determines the question whether it is a taking.  As the Court said, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, in <em>United States v. Lynah,</em>188 U.S. 445,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/445/case.html#470">188 U. S. 470</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"Where the government, by the construction of a dam or other public works, so floods lands belonging to an individual as to substantially destroy their value, there is a taking within the scope of the Fifth Amendment.  While the government does not directly proceed to appropriate the title, yet it takes away the use and value; when that is done, it is of little consequence in whom the fee may be vested.  Of course, it results from this that the proceeding must be regarded as an actual appropriation of the land, including the possession, the right of possession, and the fee, and when the amount awarded as compensation is paid, the title, the fee, with whatever rights may attach thereto -- in this case, those at least which belong to a riparian proprietor -- pass to the government, and it becomes henceforth the full owner."</p>\n<p>There is no difference of kind, but only of degree, between a permanent condition of continual overflow by backwater and a permanent liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows, and, on principle, the right to compensation must arise in the one case as in the other.  If any substantial enjoyment of the land still remains to the owner, it may be treated as a partial, instead of a total, devesting of his property in the land.  The taking by condemnation of an interest less than the fee is familiar in the law of eminent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 243 U. S. 329</a></p><p> domain.  Where formal proceedings are initiated by the party condemning, it is usual and proper to specify the precise interest taken, where less than the fee.  But where, as in this case, the property owner resorts to the courts, as he may, to recover compensation for what actually has been taken, upon the principle that the government, by the very act of taking, impliedly has promised to make compensation because the dictates of justice and the terms of the Fifth Amendment so require (<em>United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/645/case.html">112 U.

S. 465</a></span>), and it appears that less than the whole has been taken and is to be paid for, such a right or interest will be deemed to pass as is necessary fairly to effectuate the purpose of the taking, and where, as in this case, with respect to the six and six-tenths acres, land is not constantly, but only at intervals, overflowed, the fee may be permitted to remain in the owner, subject to an easement in the United States to overflow it with water as often as necessarily may result from the operation of the lock and dam for purposes of navigation.</p>\n<p>(3) In No. 84, some question is made about the allowance for the damage to the land by the destruction of the ford across Whiteoak Creek and the pass-way, but we deem the objection unsubstantial.  It is said there is nothing to show how Cress acquired ownership of the ford, and that it does not appear that he had a right to pass over the adjoining land of one Brown.  It seems to us, however, that the findings, while meager, sufficiently import that Cress had a right to a private way and ford as appurtenant to his land, and that the damage to the land by the destruction of the ford was $500.  This brings the case squarely within <em>United States v. Welch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/333/case.html">217 U.

S. 330</a></p><p> amount to a taking of land.  But the findings render it plain that it had the necessary effect of raising the creek below the dam to such an extent as to destroy the power of the milldam that was essential to the value of the mill, or, as the findings put it:</p>\n<p>"The water above the lock and dam, when it is at pool stage, is about one foot below the crest of the milldam, which prevents the drop in the current which in necessary to run the mill."</p>\n<p>Under the law of Kentucky, ownership of the bed of the creek, subject only to the natural flow of the water, is recognized as fully as ownership of the mill itself.  The right to have the water flow away from the milldam unobstructed except as in the course of nature is not a mere easement or appurtenance, but exists by the law of nature as an inseparable part of the land.  A destruction of this right is a taking of a part of the land.  <em>Gardner v. Village of Newburgh,</em> 2 Johns.Ch. 162, 166; <em>Tyler v. Wilkinson,</em> 4 Mason 397, Fed.Cas.

Singers,</em> 8 El. &amp; Bl. 31, 36 (Erle, J.).</p>\n<p>(5) In both cases, it is urged that there was error in allowing costs against the government.  Section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, under which the suits were brought, originated in the provisions of the so-called Tucker Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 243 U. S. 331</a></p><p> of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, and the argument of the government is that while, under \xc2\xa7 15 of that act, costs were recoverable against the United States in the district court as in the court of claims, yet that \xc2\xa7 297, Jud. Code, repealed all of the Tucker Act with the exception of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, which relate to matters of procedure, and that there is no longer any authority of law for allowing costs against the United States in suits brought in the district court.  The fact is that \xc2\xa7 297, Jud. Code, besides the clause repealing the Tucker Act, with the exceptions mentioned, contains in its final paragraph a repeal of "all other acts and parts of acts, insofar as they are embraced within and superseded by this act."  Now not only is the provision of \xc2\xa7 2 of the Tucker Act, conferring upon the district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims over certain claims against the United States, carried into \xc2\xa7 24(20) of the Code, but the provision of \xc2\xa7 15 of the Tucker Act for the allowance of costs against the government is carried in as \xc2\xa7 152.  It is true that \xc2\xa7 24(20) is a part of Chapter 2 of the Code, entitled "District Courts -- Jurisdiction," while \xc2\xa7 152 is a part of Chapter 7, entitled, "The Court of Claims."  But, by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 294 and 295, it is declared and enacted as follows:</p>\n<p>"Sec. 294.  The provisions of this Act, so far as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, shall be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments, and there shall be no implication of a change of intent by reason of a change of words in such statute, unless such change of intent shall be clearly manifest."</p>\n<p>"Sec. 295.  The arrangement and classification of the several sections of this Act have been made for the purpose of a more convenient and orderly arrangement of the same, and therefore no inference or presumption of a legislative construction is to be drawn by reason of the chapter under which any particular section is placed. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 243 U. S. 332</a></p><p></p>\n<p>From this, it is plain that \xc2\xa7 152 of the Code applies to suits in the district courts as well as to those in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
