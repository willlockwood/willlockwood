They smelled marijuana outside an apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence.  As soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises coming from the apartment; the officers believed that these noises were consistent with the destruction of evidence.  The officers announced their intent to enter the apartment, kicked in the door, and found respondent and others.  They saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent search.  The Circuit Court denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress the evidence, holding that exigent circumstances\xe2\x80\x94the need to prevent destruction of evidence\xe2\x80\x94justified the warrantless entry.  Respondent entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed.  The court assumed that exigent circumstances existed, but it nonetheless invalidated the search.  The exigent circumstances rule did not apply, the court held, because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.

The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for determining when police impermissibly create an exigency.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The proper test follows from the principle that permits warrantless searches: warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.  Thus, a warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct violating the Fourth Amendment.  A similar approach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.  For example, officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made, see <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/128/index.html">496 U. S. 128</a>, 136\xe2\x80\x93140; and they may seek consent-based encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs, see <em>INS</em> v. <em>Delgado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/210/index.html">466 U. S. 210</a>, 217, n.\xc2\xa05.

Such requirements are unsound and are thus rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly created when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable, but that approach is also flawed.  The ability of officers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such subtleties as the officers\xe2\x80\x99 tone of voice in announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks.  A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s test would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock without running afoul of the police-created exigency rule.  And in most cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed.  Pp. 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Any question about whether an exigency existed here is better addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand.

Respondent has pointed to no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort of \xe2\x80\x9cdemand\xe2\x80\x9d to enter the apartment, much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment.  If there is contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.  Finally, the record makes clear that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 announcement that they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency arose.

In this case, we consider whether this rule applies when police, by knocking on the door of a residence and announcing their presence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.  The Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.  We reject this interpretation of the exigent circumstances rule.  The conduct of the police prior to their entry into the apartment was entirely lawful.  They did not violate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so.  In such a situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lexington, Kentucky.  Police officers set up a controlled buy of crack cocaine outside an apartment complex.  Undercover Officer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an unmarked car in a nearby parking lot.  After the deal occurred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on the suspect.  He told the officers that the suspect was moving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment building, and he urged them to \xe2\x80\x9churry up and get there\xe2\x80\x9d before the suspect entered an apartment.  App. 20.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers drove into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and ran to the breezeway.  Just as they entered the breezeway, they heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of burnt marijuana.  At the end of the breezeway, the officers saw two apartments, one on the left and one on the right, and they did not know which apartment the suspect had entered.  Gibbons had radioed that the suspect was running into the apartment on the right, but the officers did not hear this statement because they had already left their vehicles.  Because they smelled marijuana smoke emanating from the apartment on the left, they approached the door of that apartment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who approached the door, testified that the officers banged on the left apartment door \xe2\x80\x9cas loud as [they] could\xe2\x80\x9d and announced, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98This is the police\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Police, police, police.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  Cobb said that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s soon as [the officers] started banging on the door,\xe2\x80\x9d they \xe2\x80\x9ccould hear people inside moving,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t sounded as [though] things were being moved inside the apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24.  These noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug-related evidence was about to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At that point, the officers announced that they \xe2\x80\x9cwere going to make entry inside the apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Cobb then kicked in the door, the officers entered the apartment, and they found three people in the front room: respondent Hollis King, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, and a guest who was smoking marijuana.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment during which they saw marijuana and powder cocaine in plain view.  In a subsequent search, they also discovered crack cocaine, cash, and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Police eventually entered the apartment on the right.  Inside, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the initial target of their investigation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury charged respondent with trafficking in marijuana, first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance, and second-degree persistent felony offender status.  Respondent filed a motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless search, but the Circuit Court denied the motion.  The Circuit Court concluded that the officers had probable cause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cproperly conducted [the investigation] by initially knocking on the door of the apartment unit and awaiting the response or consensual entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a.  Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry, the court held, because \xe2\x80\x9cthere was no response at all to the knocking,\xe2\x80\x9d and because \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer Cobb heard movement in the apartment which he reasonably concluded were persons in the act of destroying evidence, particularly narcotics because of the smell.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Respondent then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.  The court sentenced respondent to 11 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed.  It held that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry because the police reasonably believed that evidence would be destroyed.  The police did not impermissibly create the exigency, the court explained, because they did not deliberately evade the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed.  302 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 649 (2010).  As a preliminary matter, the court observed that there was \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 655.  But the court did not answer that question.  Instead, it \xe2\x80\x9cassume[d] for the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To determine whether police impermissibly created the exigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a two-part test.  First, the court held, police cannot \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately creat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, even absent bad faith, the court concluded, police may not rely on exigent circumstances if \xe2\x80\x9cit was reasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the court found no evidence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could not justify the search because it was reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would destroy evidence when the police knocked on the door and announced their presence.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  561 U.

First, all searches and seizures must be reasonable.  Second, a warrant may not be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope of the authorized search is set out with particularity.  See <em>Payton</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/573/index.html">445 U. S. 573</a>, 584 (1980).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not specify when a search warrant must be obtained, this Court has inferred that a warrant must generally be secured.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a \xe2\x80\x98basic principle of Fourth Amendment law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we have often said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brigham City</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/398/index.html">547 U.

But we have also recognized that this presumption may be overcome in some circumstances because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brigham City</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 403; see also <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Fisher</em>, 558 U.

Accordingly, the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions.  <em>Brigham City</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 403.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One well-recognized exception applies when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the exigencies of the situation\xe2\x80\x99 make the needs of law en-forcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mincey</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/385/index.html">437 U.

Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has identified several exigencies that may justify a warrantless search of a home.  See <em>Brigham City</em>, 547 U. S., at 403.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cemergency aid\xe2\x80\x9d exception, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cofficers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also, <em>e.g., Fisher</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding warrantless home entry based on emergency aid exception).  Police officers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect.  See <em>United States </em>v.<em> Santana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/38/index.html">427 U. S. 38</a>, 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (1976).  And\xe2\x80\x94what is relevant here\xe2\x80\x94the need \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent the imminent destruction of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d has long been recognized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.  <em>Brigham City</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 403; see also <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/103/index.html">547 U.

Under this doctrine, police may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evidence when that exigency was \xe2\x80\x9ccreated\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured\xe2\x80\x9d by the conduct of the police.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chambers</em>, 395 F.\xc2\xa03d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or a warrantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be responding to an unanticipated exigency rather than simply creating the exigency for themselves\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> United States </em>v. <em>Gould</em>, 364 F.\xc2\xa03d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a warrantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not do so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by the agents\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying this exception for the \xe2\x80\x9ccreation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing\xe2\x80\x9d of an exigency by the police, courts require something more than mere proof that fear of detection by the police caused the destruction of evidence.  An additional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth Circuit has recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cin some sense the police always create the exigent circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duchi</em>, 906 F.\xc2\xa02d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990).  That is to say, in the vast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by persons who are engaged in illegal conduct, the reason for the destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the hands of law enforcement.  Destruction of evidence issues probably occur most frequently in drug cases because drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a toilet or rinsing them down a drain.  Persons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.  Consequently, a rule that precludes the police from making a warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence whenever their conduct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the reach of this well-established exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result, the lower courts have held that the police-created exigency doctrine requires more than simple causation, but the lower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied.  Indeed, the petition in this case maintains that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are currently five different tests being used by the United States Courts of Appeals,\xe2\x80\x9d Pet. for Cert. 11, and that some state courts have crafted additional tests, <em>id.</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts, the answer to the question presented in this case follows directly and clearly from the principle that permits warrantless searches in the first place.  As previously noted, warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.  Therefore, the answer to the question before us is that the exigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search when the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is reasonable in the same sense.  Where, as here, the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have taken a similar approach in other cases involving warrantless searches.  For example, we have held that law enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view, provided that they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made.  See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/128/index.html">496 U. S. 128</a>, 136\xe2\x80\x93140 (1990).  As we put it in <em>Horton</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is \xe2\x80\xa6 an essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 136.  So long as this prerequisite is satisfied, however, it does not matter that the officer who makes the observation may have gone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with the hope of being able to view and seize the evidence.  See <em>id., </em>at 138 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that an officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, the Fourth Amendment requires only that the steps preceding the seizure be lawful.  See <em>id., </em>at 136\xe2\x80\x93137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, officers may seek consent-based encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs.  See <em>INS</em> v. <em>Delgado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/210/index.html">466 U. S. 210</a>, 217, n.\xc2\xa05 (1984) (noting that officers who entered\ninto consent-based encounters with employees in a factory building were \xe2\x80\x9clawfully present [in the factory] pursuant to consent or a warrant\xe2\x80\x9d).  If consent is freely given, it makes no difference that an officer may have approached the person with the hope or expectation of obtaining consent.  See <em>id.,</em> at 216 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without being told they are free not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some lower courts have adopted a rule that is similar to the one that we recognize today.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald</em>, 916 F.\xc2\xa02d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law enforcement officers \xe2\x80\x9cdo not impermissibly create exigent circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d when they \xe2\x80\x9cact in an entirely lawful manner\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson</em>, 2010 WI 80, \xc2\xb632, 327 Wis. 2d 302, 326\xe2\x80\x93328, 786 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 463, 475\xe2\x80\x93476 (2010).  But others, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have imposed additional requirements that are unsound and that we now reject.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bad faith</em>.  Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  302 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 656 (quoting <em>Gould</em>, 364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 590); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chambers</em>, 395 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 566; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Socey</em>, 846 F.\xc2\xa02d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rengifo</em>, 858 F.\xc2\xa02d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur cases have repeatedly rejected\xe2\x80\x9d a subjective approach, asking only whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances, viewed <em>objectively</em>, justify the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>\xe2\x80\x99Brigham City</em>, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Fisher</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x935).  Indeed, we have never held, outside limited contexts such as an \xe2\x80\x9cinventory search or administrative inspection \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, that an officer\xe2\x80\x99s motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a>, 812 (1996); see also <em>Brigham City, supra, </em>at 405.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than subjective intent, are clear.  Legal tests based on reasonableness are generally objective, and this Court has long taken the view that \xe2\x80\x9cevenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Horton</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 138.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reasonable foreseeability</em>.  Some courts, again including the Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not rely on an exigency if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it was reasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  302 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 656 (quoting <em>Mann </em>v<em>.</em> <em>State</em>, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 826, 834 (2004)); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mowatt</em>, 513 F.\xc2\xa03d 395, 402 (CA4 2008).  Courts applying this\ntest have invalidated warrantless home searches on the ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police officers, by knocking on the door and announcing their presence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em>, at 402\xe2\x80\x93403; 302 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 656.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected the notion that police may seize evidence without a warrant only when they come across the evidence by happenstance.  In <em>Horton</em>, as noted, we held that the police may seize evidence in plain view even though the officers may be \xe2\x80\x9cinterested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to find it in the course of a search.\xe2\x80\x9d  496 U. S., at 138.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also introduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability.  For example, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the door of premises occupied by a person who may be involved in the drug trade, there is <em>some</em> possibility that the occupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy them.  Under a reasonable foreseeability test, it would be necessary to quantify the degree of predictability that must be reached before the police-created exigency doctrine comes into play.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such an approach would produce.  Suppose that the officers in the present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus knew only that there was a 50% chance that the fleeing suspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than the apartment on the right.  Under those circumstances, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy evidence upon learning that the police were at the door?  Or suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect had disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with 3, 5, 10, or even 20 units?  If the police chose a door at random and knocked for the purpose of asking the occupants if they knew a person who fit the description of the suspect, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would seek to destroy evidence?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\xe2\x80\x94in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U. S. 386</a>, 396\xe2\x80\x93397 (1989).  The reasonable foreseeability test would create unacceptable and unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers who must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for judges who would be required to determine after the fact whether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock on the door was reasonably foreseeable based on what the officers knew at the time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Probable cause and time to secure a warrant</em>.  Some courts, in applying the police-created exigency doctrine, fault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring evidence that is sufficient to establish probable cause to search particular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but instead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an occupant or to obtain consent to search.  See, <em>e.g., Chambers</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 569 (citing \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he failure to seek a warrant in the face of plentiful probable cause\xe2\x80\x9d as a factor indicating that the police deliberately created the exigency).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate law enforcement strategies.  There are many entirely proper reasons why police may not want to seek a search warrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed to establish probable cause is acquired.  Without attempting to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons, we note a few.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the police may wish to speak with the occupants of a dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek authorization for a search.  They may think that a short and simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for and execute a warrant.  See <em>Schneckloth</em> v. <em>Bustamonte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U. S. 218</a>, 228 (1973).  Second, the police may want to ask an occupant of the premises for consent to search because doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome than applying for a warrant.  A consensual search also \xe2\x80\x9cmay result in considerably less inconvenience\xe2\x80\x9d and embarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted pursuant to a warrant.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Third, law enforcement officers may wish to obtain more evidence before submitting what might otherwise be considered a marginal warrant application.  Fourth, prosecutors may wish to wait until they acquire evidence that can justify a search that is broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is likely to authorize based on the evidence then available.  And finally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want to execute a search that will disclose the existence of an investigation because doing so may interfere with the acquisition of additional evidence against those already under suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet unknown participants in a criminal scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have said that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]aw enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffa</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/293/index.html">385 U. S. 293</a>, 310 (1966).  Faulting the police for failing to apply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time after obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is nowhere to be found in the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Standard or good investigative tactics</em>.  Finally, some lower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers may be found to have created or manufactured an exigency if the court concludes that the course of their investigation was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to standard or good law enforcement practices (or to the policies or practices of their jurisdictions).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gould</em>, 364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 591.  This approach fails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that are the province of those who are responsible for federal and state law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those discussed above, but his rule is also flawed.  Respondent contends that law enforcement officers impermissibly create an exigency when they \xe2\x80\x9cengage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is imminent and inevitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 24.  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view, relevant factors include the officers\xe2\x80\x99 tone of voice in announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks.  But the ability of law enforcement officers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such subtleties.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Police officers may have a very good reason to announce their presence loudly and to knock on the door with some force.  A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone is at the door.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/31/index.html"></a><a href="/us/540/31/index.html">540 U. S. 31</a>, 33 (2003) (Police \xe2\x80\x9crapped hard enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door\xe2\x80\x9d and announced their presence, but defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas in the shower and testified that he heard nothing\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, unless police officers identify themselves loudly enough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.  Officers are permitted\xe2\x80\x94indeed, encouraged\xe2\x80\x94to identify themselves to citizens, and \xe2\x80\x9cin many circumstances this\nis cause for assurance, not discomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drayton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/194/index.html">536 U. S. 194</a>, 204 (2002).  Citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their doorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police officers.  Others may appreciate the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether to answer the door to the police.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If respondent\xe2\x80\x99s test were adopted, it would be extremely difficult for police officers to know how loudly they may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock on a door without running afoul of the police-created exigency rule.  And in most cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed.  The Fourth Amendment does not require the nebulous and impractical test that respondent proposes.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to premises by means of an actual or threatened violation of the Fourth Amendment.  This holding provides ample protection for the privacy rights that the Amendment protects.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any private citizen might do.  And whether the person who knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak is a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no obligation to open the door or to speak.  Cf. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/491/index.html">460 U. S. 491</a>, 497\xe2\x80\x93498 (1983).  (\xe2\x80\x9c[H]e may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>When the police knock on a door but the occupants choose not to respond or to speak,<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation will have reached a conspicuously low point,\xe2\x80\x9d and the occupants \xe2\x80\x9cwill have the kind of warning that even the most elaborate security system cannot provide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chambers</em>, 395 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting).  And even if an occupant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers, the occupant need not allow the officers to enter the premises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless exigent-circumstances search that may ensue.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now apply our interpretation of the police-created exigency doctrine to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide whether exigent circumstances existed in this case.  Any warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a genuine exigency.  See <em>Brigham City</em>, 547 U. S., at 406<em>.</em>  The trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals found that there was a real exigency in this case, but the Kentucky Supreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, observing that there was \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d  302 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 655.  The Kentucky Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cassum[ed] for the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>and it held that the police had impermissibly manufactured the exigency.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We, too, assume for purposes of argument that an exigency existed.  We decide only the question on which the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted certiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermissibly create an exigency?  Any question about whether an exigency actually existed is better addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand.  See <em>Kirk</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/635/index.html">536 U. S. 635</a>, 638 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em> (reversing state-court judgment that exigent circumstances were not required for warrantless home entry and remanding for state court to determine whether exigent circumstances were present).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment.  Officer Cobb testified without contradiction that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cbanged on the door as loud as [they] could\xe2\x80\x9d and announced either \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Police, police, police\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98This is the police.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  This conduct was entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no other evidence that might show that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for example, by announcing that they would break down the door if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent argues that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cdemanded\xe2\x80\x9d entry to the apartment, but he has not pointed to any evidence in the record that supports this assertion.  He relies on a passing statement made by the trial court in its opinion denying respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a\xe2\x80\x934a.  In recounting the events that preceded the search, the judge wrote that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cbanged on the door of the apartment on the back left of the breezeway identifying themselves as police officers and <em>demanding</em> that the door be opened by the persons inside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added and deleted).  However, at a later point in this opinion, the judge stated that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cinitially knock[ed] on the door of the apartment unit and await[ed] the response or consensual entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 9a.  This later statement is consistent with the testimony at the suppression hearing and with the findings of the state appellate courts.  See 302 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 651 (The officers \xe2\x80\x9cknocked loudly on the back left apartment door and announced \xe2\x80\x98police\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a (The officers \xe2\x80\x9cknock[ed] on the door and announc[ed] themselves as police\xe2\x80\x9d); App. 22\xe2\x80\x9324.  There is no evidence of a \xe2\x80\x9cdemand\xe2\x80\x9d of any sort, much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment.  If there is contradictory evidence that has not been brought to our attention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondent claims that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cexplained to [the occupants that the officers] were going to make entry inside the apartment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 24, but the record is clear that the officers did not make this statement until after the exigency arose.  As Officer Cobb testified, the officers \xe2\x80\x9cknew that there was possibly something that was going to be destroyed inside the apartment,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]t that point</em>, \xe2\x80\xa6 [they] explained \xe2\x80\xa6 [that they] were going to make entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).

They then knocked on the door and demanded entry.  Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant of the room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and discovered opium and drug paraphernalia.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">Defending the legality of the search, the Government attempted to justify the warrantless search of the room as a valid search incident to a lawful arrest. See Brief for United States in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1947, No. 329, pp.\xc2\xa013, 16, 36.  The Government did not contend that the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of evidence.  Although the officers said that they heard a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shuffling\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d noise inside the room after they knocked on the door, 333 U.

In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neutral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then break the door down, nevermind that they had ample time to obtain a warrant.  I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reduction of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right \xe2\x80\xa6 to be secure in their \xe2\x80\xa6 houses \xe2\x80\xa6 against unreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warrants to search, the Amendment further instructs, shall issue only upon a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause\xe2\x80\x9d to believe criminal activity is afoot.  These complementary provisions are designed to ensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral magistrate before undertaking a search or seizure.  Exceptions to the warrant requirement, this Court has explained, must be \xe2\x80\x9cfew in number and carefully delineated,\xe2\x80\x9d if the main rule is to remain hardy.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/297/index.html">407 U.

S. 27</a>, 31 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case involves a principal exception to the warrant requirement, the exception applicable in \xe2\x80\x9cexigent circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]arefully delineated,\xe2\x80\x9d the exception should govern only in genuine emergency situations.  Circumstances qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cexigent\xe2\x80\x9d when there is an imminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect will escape.  <em>Brigham City</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/398/index.html">547 U. S. 398</a>, 403 (2006).  The question presented: May police, who could pause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dispense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creating exigent circumstances?  I would answer no, as did the Kentucky Supreme Court.  The urgency must exist, I would rule, when the police come on the scene, not subsequent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence should have controlled the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling: First, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever practical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a>, 20 (1968); second, unwarranted \xe2\x80\x9csearches and seizures inside a home\xe2\x80\x9d bear heightened scrutiny, <em>Payton</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/573/index.html">445 U. S. 573</a>, 586 (1980).  The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson observed, ranks among the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are un-\nder the law, and the police-state where they are the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/10/index.html">333 U. S. 10</a>, 17 (1948).  The Court has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in the main, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>per se</em> unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mincey</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/385/index.html">437 U.

There was little risk that drug-related evidence would have been destroyed had the police delayed the search pending \na magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s authorization.  As the Court recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ersons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the knock at the apartment door, the occupants were apprehensive about police proximity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with greater force than in our homes, our most private space which, for centuries, has been regarded as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98entitled to special protection.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/103/index.html">547 U.

The target of the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seeping under the apartment door into the hallway, the Kentucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause \xe2\x80\xa6 sufficient \xe2\x80\xa6 to obtain a warrant to search the \xe2\x80\xa6 apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d  302 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).

Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.  See Brief for Petitioner 35, n.\xc2\xa013 (asserting \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t should be of no importance whether police could have obtained a\nwarrant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Johnson</em>, the Court confronted this scenario: standing outside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium and heard \xe2\x80\x9csome shuffling or noise\xe2\x80\x9d coming from the room.  333 U.
