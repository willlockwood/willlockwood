United States, 431 U.S.  324 (1977)</h3><p><b>Teamsters v. United States</b></p><p><b>No. 75-636</b></p><p><b>Argued January 10, 1977</b></p><p><b>Decided May 31, 1977<l=|431 324ast|="" u.s.="">*</l=|431></b></p><p><b>431 U.S. 324</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The United States instituted this litigation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against petitioners, a nationwide common carrier of motor freight, and a union representing a large group of the company\'s employees.  The Government alleged that the company had engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminating against Negroes and Spanish-surnamed persons (hereinafter sometimes collectively "minority members") who were hired as servicemen or local city drivers, which were lower paying, less desirable jobs than the positions of line drivers (over-the-road, long-distance drivers), which went to whites, and that the seniority system in the collective bargaining agreements between petitioners perpetuated ("locked in") the effects of past racial and ethnic discrimination because, under that system, a city driver or serviceman who transferred to a line driver job had to forfeit all the competitive seniority he had accumulated in his previous bargaining unit and start at the bottom of the line drivers\' "board."  The Government sought a general injunctive remedy and specific "make whole" relief for individual discriminatees, which would allow them an opportunity to transfer to line driver jobs with full company seniority.  Section 703(a) of Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice, <em>inter alia,</em> for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual or otherwise discriminate against him with regard to his employment because of his race or national origin.  Section 703(h) provides in part that, notwithstanding other provisions, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different employment standards "pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . . system, . . . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate. . . ."  The District Court after trial, with respect to both the employment discrimination and the seniority system in the collective bargaining agreements, held that petitioners had violated Title VII and enjoined both the company and the union from committing further violations thereof.  With respect to individual relief, the court determined that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="325">Page 431 U. S. 325</a></p><p> the "affected class" of discriminatees included all minority members who had been hired as city drivers or servicemen at every company terminal with a line driver operation, whether they were hired before or after Title VII\'s effective date.  The discriminatees thereby became entitled to preference over all other line driver applicants in the future.  Finding that members of the affected class had been injured in varying degrees, the court created three subclasses, and applied to each a different formula for filling line driver jobs and for establishment of seniority, giving retroactive seniority to the effective date of the Act to those who suffered "severe injury."  The right of any class member to a line driver vacancy was made subject to the prior recall rights under the collective bargaining agreement of line drivers who had been on layoff for not more than three years.  Although agreeing with the District Court\'s basic conclusions, the Court of Appeals rejected the affected-class trisection, holding that the minority members could bid for future line driver jobs on the basis of their company seniority, and that, once a class member became a line driver, he could use his full company seniority even if it antedated Title VII\'s effective date, limited only by a "qualification date" formula, under which seniority could not be awarded for periods prior to the date when (1) a line driver job was vacant, and (2) the class member met (or, given the opportunity, would have met) the line driver qualifications.  Holding that the three-year priority in favor of laid-off workers "would unduly impede the eradication of past discrimination," the Court of Appeals directed that, when a not purely temporary line driver vacancy arose, a class member might compete against any line driver on layoff on the basis of the member\'s retroactive seniority.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The Government sustained its burden of proving that the company engaged in a systemwide pattern or practice of employment discrimination against minority members in violation of Title VII by regularly and purposefully treating such members less favorably than white persons.  The evidence, showing pervasive statistical disparities in line driver positions between employment of the minority members and whites, and bolstered by considerable testimony of specific instances of discrimination, was not adequately rebutted by the company, and supported the findings of the courts below.

Since the Government proved that the company engaged in a post-Act pattern of discriminatory employment policies, retroactive seniority may be awarded as relief for post-Act discriminatees even if the seniority system agreement makes no provision for such relief.  <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U.

The seniority system was protected by \xc2\xa7 703(h), and therefore the union\'s conduct in agreeing to and maintaining the system did not violate Title VII.  Employees who suffered only pre-Act discrimination are not entitled to relief, and no person may be given retroactive seniority to a date earlier than the Act\'s effective date.  The District Court\'s injunction against the union must consequently be vacated.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#348">431 U.

Thus, here, because of the company\'s intentional pre-Act discrimination, the disproportionate advantage given by the seniority system to the white line drivers with the longest tenure over the minority member employees who might by now have enjoyed those advantages were it not for the pre-Act discrimination is sanctioned by \xc2\xa7 703(h).

Every post-Act minority member applicant for a line driver position is presumptively entitled to relief, subject to a showing by the company that its earlier refusal to place the applicant in a line driver job was not based on its policy of discrimination.  <em>Cf.

An incumbent employee\'s failure to apply for a job does not inexorably bar an award of retroactive seniority, and individual nonapplicants must be afforded an opportunity to undertake their difficult task of proving that they should be treated as applicants, and therefore are presumptively entitled to relief accordingly.

S. 421</a></span>.  Measured against the broad prophylactic purposes of Title VII, the company\'s assertion that a person who has not actually applied for a job can never be awarded seniority relief cannot prevail, for a consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.

S. 327</a></p><p> victim of unlawful discrimination and that he would have applied for a line driver job but for the company\'s discriminatory practices.  The known prospect of discriminatory rejection shows only that employees who wanted line driving jobs may have been deterred from applying for them but does not show which of the nonapplicants actually wanted such jobs or were qualified.  Consequently, the Government has the burden of proving at a remedial hearing to be conducted by the District Court which specific nonapplicants would have applied for line driver jobs but for their knowledge of the company\'s discriminatory policies.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This litigation brings here several important questions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e <em>et seq.</em> (1970 ed. and Supp. V).  The issues grow out of alleged unlawful employment practices engaged in by an employer and a union.  The employer is a common carrier of motor freight with nationwide operations, and the union represents a large group of its employees.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the employer had violated Title VII by engaging in a pattern and practice of employment discrimination against Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans, and that the union had violated the Act by agreeing with the employer to create and maintain a seniority system that perpetuated the effects of past racial and ethnic discrimination.  In addition to the basic questions presented by these two rulings, other subsidiary issues must be resolved if violations of Title VII occurred -- issues concerning the nature of the relief to which aggrieved individuals may be entitled.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The United States brought an action in a Tennessee federal court against the petitioner T.I.M.E.-D.C. Inc. (company), pursuant to \xc2\xa7 707(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-6(a). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The complaint charged that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 431 U. S. 329</a></p><p> company had followed discriminatory hiring, assignment, and promotion policies against Negroes at its terminal in Nashville, Tenn. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Government brought a second action against the company almost three years later in a Federal District Court in Texas, charging a pattern and practice of employment discrimination against Negroes and Spanish-surnamed persons throughout the company\'s transportation system.  The petitioner International Brotherhood of Teamsters (union) was joined as a defendant in that suit.  The two actions were consolidated for trial in the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p>The central claim in both lawsuits was that the company had engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminating against minorities in hiring so-called line drivers.  Those Negroes and Spanish-surnamed persons who had been hired, the Government alleged, were given lower paying, less desirable jobs as servicemen or local city drivers, and were thereafter discriminated against with respect to promotions and transfers. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 431 U. S. 330</a></p><p> this connection, the complaint also challenged the seniority system established by the collective bargaining agreements between the employer and the union.  The Government sought a general injunctive remedy and specific "make whole" relief for all individual discriminatees, which would allow them an opportunity to transfer to line driver jobs with full company seniority for all purposes.</p>\n<p>The cases went to trial [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and the District Court found that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 431 U. S. 331</a></p><p> the Government had shown</p>\n<p>"by a preponderance of the evidence that T.I.M.E.-D.C. and its predecessor companies were engaged in a plan and practice of discrimination in violation of Title VII. . . . [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]"</p>\n<p>The court further found that the seniority system contained in the collective bargaining contracts between the company and the union violated Title VII because it "operate[d] to impede the free transfer of minority groups into and within the company."  Both the company and the union were enjoined from committing further violations of Title VII.</p>\n<p>With respect to individual relief, the court accepted the Government\'s basic contention that the "affected class" of discriminatees included all Negro and Spanish-surnamed incumbent employees who had been hired to fill city operations or serviceman jobs at every terminal that had a line driver operation. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  All of these employees, whether hired before or after the effective date of Title VII, thereby became entitled to preference over all other applicants with respect to consideration for future vacancies in line driver jobs. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Finding that members of the affected class had been injured in different degrees, the court created three subclasses.  Thirty persons who had produced "the most convincing evidence of discrimination and harm" were found to have suffered "severe injury."  The court ordered that they be offered the opportunity to fill line driver jobs with competitive seniority dating back to July 2, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 431 U. S. 332</a></p><p> 1965, the effective date of Title VII. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  A second subclass included four persons who were "very possibly the objects of discrimination" and who "were likely harmed," but as to whom there had been no specific evidence of discrimination and injury.  The court decreed that these persons were entitled to fill vacancies in line driving jobs with competitive seniority as of January 14, 1971, the date on which the Government had filed its systemwide lawsuit.  Finally, there were over 300 remaining members of the affected class as to whom there was "no evidence to show that these individuals were either harmed or not harmed individually."  The court ordered that they be considered for line driver jobs [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] ahead of any applicants from the general public, but behind the two other subclasses.  Those in the third subclass received no retroactive seniority; their competitive seniority as line drivers would begin with the date they were hired as line drivers.  The court further decreed that the right of any class member to fill a line driver vacancy was subject to the prior recall rights of laid-off line drivers, which under the collective bargaining agreements then in effect extended for three years.

S. 333</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the basic conclusions of the District Court:  that the company had engaged in a pattern or practice of employment discrimination and that the seniority system in the collective bargaining agreements violated Title VII as applied to victims of prior discrimination.  517 F.2d 299.  The appellate court held, however, that the relief ordered by the District Court was inadequate.  Rejecting the District Court\'s attempt to trisect the affected class, the Court of Appeals held that all Negro and Spanish-surnamed incumbent employees were entitled to bid for future line driver jobs on the basis of their company seniority, and that\' once a class member had filled a job, he could use his full company seniority -- even if it predated the effective date of Title VII-for all purposes, including bidding and layoff.  This award of retroactive seniority was to be limited only by a "qualification date" formula, under which seniority could not be awarded for periods prior to the date when (1) a line driving position was vacant, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and (2) the class member met (or would have met, given the opportunity) the qualifications for employment as a line driver. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Finally, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 431 U. S. 334</a></p><p> the Court of Appeals modified that part of the District Court\'s decree that had subjected the rights of class members to fill future vacancies to the recall rights of laid-off employees.  Holding that the three-year priority in favor of laid-off workers "would unduly impede the eradication of past discrimination," <em>id.</em> at 322, the Court of Appeals ordered that class members be allowed to compete for vacancies with laid-off employees on the basis of the class members\' retroactive seniority.  Laid-off line drivers would retain their prior recall rights with respect only to "purely temporary" vacancies.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court to hold the evidentiary hearings necessary to apply these remedial principles.

The union further contends that the seniority system contained in the collective bargaining agreements in no way violated Title VII.  If these contentions are correct, it is unnecessary, of course, to reach any of the issues concerning remedies that so occupied the attention of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Consideration of the question whether the company engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory hiring practices </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 431 U. S. 335</a></p><p> involves controlling legal principles that are relatively clear.  The Government\'s theory of discrimination was simply that the company, in violation of \xc2\xa7 703(a) of Title VII, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] regularly and purposefully treated Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans less favorably than white persons.  The disparity in treatment allegedly involved the refusal to recruit, hire, transfer, or promote minority group members on an equal basis with white people, particularly with respect to line driving positions.  The ultimate factual issues are thus simply whether there was a pattern or practice of such disparate treatment and, if so, whether the differences were "racially premised."  <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

And, because it alleged a systemwide pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII rights, the Government ultimately had to prove more than the mere occurrence of isolated or "accidental" or sporadic discriminatory acts.  It had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that racial discrimination was the company\'s standard operating procedure -- the regular, rather than the unusual, practice. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="337">Page 431 U. S. 337</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the Government carried its burden of proof.  As of March 31, 1971, shortly after the Government filed its complaint alleging systemwide discrimination, the company had 6,472 employees.  Of these, 314 (5%) were Negroes and 257 (4%) were Spanish-surnamed Americans.  Of the 1,828 line drivers, however, there were only 8 (0.4%) Negroes and 5 (0.3%) Spanish-surnamed persons, and all of the Negroes had been hired after the litigation had commenced.  With one exception -- a man who worked as a line driver at the Chicago terminal from 1950 to 1959 -- the company and its predecessors did not employ a Negro on a regular basis as a line driver until 1969.  And, as the Government showed, even in 1971, there were terminals in areas of substantial Negro population where all of the company\'s line drivers were white. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  A great majority of the Negroes (83%) and Spanish-surnamed Americans </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 431 U. S. 338</a></p><p> (78%) who did work for the company held the lower paying city operations and serviceman jobs, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] whereas only 39% of the nonminority employees held jobs in those categories.</p>\n<p>The Government bolstered its statistical evidence with the testimony of individuals who recounted over 40 specific instances of discrimination.  Upon the basis of this testimony, the District Court found that</p>\n<p>"[n]umerous qualified black and Spanish-surnamed American applicants who sought line driving jobs at the company over the years, either had their requests ignored, were given false or misleading information about requirements, opportunities, and application procedures, or were not considered and hired on the same basis that whites were considered and hired."</p>\n<p>Minority employees who wanted to transfer to line driver jobs met with similar difficulties.

S. 339</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The company\'s principal response to this evidence is that statistics can never, in and of themselves, prove the existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination, or even establish a <em>prima facie</em> case shifting to the employer the burden of rebutting the inference raised by the figures.  But, as even our brief summary of the evidence shows, this was not a case in which the Government relied on "statistics alone."  The individuals who testified about their personal experiences with the company brought the cold numbers convincingly to life.</p>\n<p>In any event, our cases make it unmistakably clear that "[s]tatistical analyses have served and will continue to serve an important role" in cases in which the existence of discrimination is a disputed issue.  <em>Mayor of Philadelphia v.

S. 341</a></p><p> situation as of the effective date of Title VII.  The company concedes that its line drivers were virtually all white in July, 1965, but it claims that, thereafter, business conditions were such that its workforce dropped.  Its argument is that low personnel turnover, rather than post-Act discrimination, accounts for more recent statistical disparities.  It points to substantial minority hiring in later years, especially after 1971, as showing that any pre-Act patterns of discrimination were broken.</p>\n<p>The argument would be a forceful one if this were an employer who, at the time of suit, had done virtually no new hiring since the effective date of Title VII.  But it is not.  Although the company\'s total number of employees apparently dropped somewhat during the late 1960\'s, the record shows that many line drivers continued to be hired throughout this period, and that almost all of them were white. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  To be sure, there were improvements in the company\'s hiring practices.  The Court of Appeals commented that</p>\n<p>"T.I.M.E.-D.C.\'s recent minority hiring progress stands as a laudable good faith effort to eradicate the effects of past discrimination in the area of hiring and initial assignment.

But the District Court and the Court of Appeals found upon substantial evidence that the company had engaged in a course of discrimination that continued well after the effective date of Title VII.  The company\'s later changes in its hiring and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 431 U.

S. 24</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals also found that the seniority system contained in the collective bargaining agreements between the company and the union operated to violate Title VII of the Act.</p>\n<p>For purposes of calculating benefits, such as vacations, pensions, and other fringe benefits, an employee\'s seniority under this system runs from the date he joins the company, and takes into account his total service in all jobs and bargaining units.  For competitive purposes, however, such as determining the order in which employees may bid for particular jobs, are laid off, or are recalled from layoff, it is bargaining unit seniority that controls.  Thus, a line driver\'s seniority, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 431 U. S. 344</a></p><p> for purposes of bidding for particular runs [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] and protection against layoff, takes into account only the length of time he has been a line driver at a particular terminal. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The practical effect is that a city driver or serviceman who transfers to a line driver job must forfeit all the competitive seniority he has accumulated in his previous bargaining unit and start at the bottom of the line drivers\' "board."</p>\n<p>The vice of this arrangement, as found by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, was that it "locked" minority workers into inferior jobs and perpetuated prior discrimination by discouraging transfers to jobs as line drivers.  While the disincentive applied to all workers, including whites, it was Negroes and Spanish-surnamed persons who, those courts found, suffered the most because many of them had been denied the equal opportunity to become line drivers when they were initially hired, whereas whites either had not sought or were refused line driver positions for reasons unrelated to their race or national origin.</p>\n<p>The linchpin of the theory embraced by the District Court and the Court of Appeals was that a discriminatee who must forfeit his competitive seniority in order finally to obtain a line driver job will never be able to "catch up" to the seniority level of his contemporary who was not subject to discrimination. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Accordingly, this continued, built-in disadvantage to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 431 U. S. 345</a></p><p> the prior discriminatee who transfers to a line driver job was held to constitute a continuing violation of Title VII, for which both the employer and the union who jointly created and maintain the seniority system were liable.</p>\n<p>The union, while acknowledging that the seniority system may in some sense perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination, asserts that the system is immunized from a finding of illegality by reason of \xc2\xa7 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(h), which provides in part:</p>\n<p>"Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . . system, . . . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race . . . or national origin. . . ."</p>\n<p>It argues that the seniority system in this case is "bona fide" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 703(h) when judged in light of its history, intent, application, and all of the circumstances under which it was created and is maintained.  More specifically, the union claims that the central purpose of \xc2\xa7 703(h) is to ensure that mere perpetuation of pre-Act discrimination is not unlawful under Title VII.  And, whether or not \xc2\xa7 703(h) immunizes the perpetuation of post-Act discrimination, the union claims that the seniority system in this litigation has no such effect.  Its position in this Court, as has been its position throughout this litigation, is that the seniority system presents no hurdle to post-Act discriminatees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 431 U. S. 346</a></p><p> who seek retroactive seniority to the date they would have become line drivers but for the company\'s discrimination.  Indeed, the union asserts that, under its collective bargaining agreements, the union will itself take up the cause of the post-Act victim and attempt, through grievance procedures, to gain for him full "make whole" relief, including appropriate seniority.</p>\n<p>The Government responds that a seniority system that perpetuates the effects of prior discrimination -- pre-Act or post-Act -- can never be "bona fide" under \xc2\xa7 703(h); at a minimum, Title VII prohibits those applications of a seniority system that perpetuate the effects on incumbent employees of prior discriminatory job assignments.</p>\n<p>The issues thus joined are open ones in this Court. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  We considered \xc2\xa7 703(h) in <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U. S. 747</a></span>, but there decided only that \xc2\xa7 703(h) does not bar the award of retroactive seniority to job applicants who seek relief from an employer\'s post-Act hiring discrimination.  We stated that</p>\n<p>"the thrust of [\xc2\xa7 703(h)] is directed toward </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 431 U. S. 347</a></p><p> defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination occurring prior to the effective date of the Act."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#761">424 U. S. 761</a></span>.  Beyond noting the general purpose of the statute, however, we did not undertake the task of statutory construction required in this litigation.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>Because the company discriminated both before and after the enactment of Title VII, the seniority system is said to have operated to perpetuate the effects of both pre- and post-Act discrimination.  Post-Act discriminatees, however, may obtain full "make whole" relief, including retroactive seniority under <em>Franks v. Bowman, supra,</em> without attacking the legality of the seniority system as applied to them.  <em>Franks</em> made clear, and the union acknowledges, that retroactive seniority may be awarded as relief from an employer\'s discriminatory hiring and assignment policies even if the seniority system agreement itself makes no provision for such relief.

But both the literal terms of \xc2\xa7 703(h) and the legislative history of Title VII demonstrate that Congress considered this very effect of many seniority systems and extended a measure of immunity to them.\n</em></p>\n<p>Throughout the initial consideration of H.R. 7152, later enacted as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critics of the bill charged that it would destroy existing seniority rights. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  The consistent response of Title VII\'s congressional proponents and of the Justice Department was that seniority rights would not be affected, even where the employer had discriminated prior to the Act. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  An interpretive memorandum placed in the Congressional Record by Senators Clark and Case stated:</p>\n<p>"Title VII would have no effect on established seniority rights.  Its effect is prospective, and not retrospective.  Thus, for example, <em>if a business has been discriminating in the past and, as a result, has an all-white working force, when the title comes into effect, the employer\'s obligation would be simply to fill future vacancies on a nondiscriminatory basis.</em>  He would not be obliged -- or indeed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 431 U. S. 351</a></p><p> permitted -- to fire whites in order to hire Negroes, or to prefer Negroes for future vacancies, or, once Negroes are hired, to give them special seniority rights at the expense of the white workers hired earlier."</p>\n<p>110 Cong.Rec. 7213 (1964) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  A Justice Department statement concerning Title VII, placed in the Congressional Record by Senator Clark, voiced the same conclusion:</p>\n<p>"Title VII would have no effect on seniority rights existing at the time it takes effect.  If, for example, a collective bargaining contract provides that, in the event of layoffs, those who were hired last must be laid off first, such a provision would not be affected in the least by title VII.  <em>This would be true even in the case where, owing to discrimination prior to the effective date of the title, white workers had more seniority than Negroes.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7207 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 431 U. S. 352</a></p><p></p>\n<p>While these statements were made before \xc2\xa7 703(h) was added to Title VII, they are authoritative indicators of that section\'s purpose.  Section 703(h) was enacted as part of the Mansfield-Dirksen compromise substitute bill that cleared the way for the passage of Title VII. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  The drafters of the compromise bill stated that one of its principal goals was to resolve the ambiguities in the House-passed version of H.R. 7152.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 110 Cong.Rec. 11935-11937 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Dirksen); <em>id.</em> at 12707 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).  As the debates indicate, one of those ambiguities concerned Title VII\'s impact on existing collectively bargained seniority rights.  It is apparent that \xc2\xa7 703(h) was drafted with an eye toward meeting the earlier criticism on this issue with an explicit provision embodying the understanding and assurances of the Act\'s proponents, namely, that Title VII would not outlaw such differences in treatment among employees as flowed from a bona fide seniority system that allowed for full exercise of seniority accumulated before the effective date of the Act.  It is inconceivable that \xc2\xa7 703(h), as part of a compromise bill, was intended to vitiate the earlier representations of the Act\'s supporters by increasing Title VII\'s impact on seniority systems.  The statement of Senator Humphrey, noted in <em>Franks,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#761">424 U. S. 761</a></span>, confirms that the addition of \xc2\xa7 703(h) "merely clarifies [Title VII\'s] present intent and effect."  110 Cong.Rec. 12723 (1964).</p>\n<p>In sum, the unmistakable purpose of \xc2\xa7 703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under Title VII.  As the legislative history shows, this was the intended result even where the employer\'s pre-Act discrimination resulted in whites having greater existing seniority rights than Negroes.  Although a seniority system inevitably tends to perpetuate the effects of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 431 U. S. 353</a></p><p> pre-Act discrimination in such cases, the congressional judgment was that Title VII should not outlaw the use of existing seniority lists, and thereby destroy or water down the vested seniority rights of employees simply because their employer had engaged in discrimination prior to the passage of the Act.</p>\n<p>To be sure, \xc2\xa7 703(h) does not immunize all seniority systems.  It refers only to "bona fide" systems, and a proviso requires that any differences in treatment not be "the result of an intention to discriminate because of race . . . or national origin. . . ."  But our reading of the legislative history compels us to reject the Government\'s broad argument that no seniority system that tends to perpetuate pre-Act discrimination can be "bona fide."  To accept the argument would require us to hold that a seniority system becomes illegal simply because it allows the full exercise of the pre-Act seniority rights of employees of a company that discriminated before Title VII was enacted.  It would place an affirmative obligation on the parties to the seniority agreement to subordinate those rights in favor of the claims of pre-Act discriminatees without seniority.  The consequence would be a perversion of the congressional purpose.  We cannot accept the invitation to disembowel \xc2\xa7 703(h) by reading the words "bona fide" as the Government would have us do. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Accordingly, we hold that an otherwise neutral, legitimate seniority system does not become unlawful under Title VII simply because it may perpetuate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 431 U. S. 354</a></p><p> pre-Act discrimination.  Congress did not intend to make it illegal for employees with vested seniority rights to continue to exercise those rights, even at the expense of pre-Act discriminatees. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]</p>\n<p>That conclusion is inescapable even in a case, such as this one, where the pre-Act discriminatees are incumbent employees who accumulated seniority in other bargaining units.  Although there seems to be no explicit reference in the legislative history to pre-Act discriminatees already employed in less desirable jobs, there can be no rational basis for distinguishing their claims from those of persons initially denied <em>any</em> job but hired later with less seniority than they might have had in the absence of pre-Act discrimination. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  We rejected any such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 431 U. S. 355</a></p><p> distinction in <em>Franks,</em> finding that it had "no support anywhere in Title VII or its legislative history," 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#768">424 U. S. 768</a></span>.  As discussed above, Congress, in 1964, made clear that a seniority system is not unlawful because it honors employees\' existing rights, even where the employer has engaged in pre-Act discriminatory hiring or promotion practices.  It would be as contrary to that mandate to forbid the exercise of seniority rights with respect to discriminatees who held inferior jobs as with respect to later hired minority employees who previously were denied any job.  If anything, the latter group is the more disadvantaged.  As in <em>Franks,</em> "<em>it would indeed be surprising if Congress gave a remedy for the one [group] which it denied for the other.\'"  <em>Ibid.,</em> quoting <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/177/case.html">313 U. S. 177</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/177/case.html#187">313 U. S. 187</a></span>. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p><em>(3)\n</em></p>\n<p>The seniority system in this litigation is entirely bona fide.  It applies equally to all races and ethnic groups.  To the extent that it "locks" employees into non-line driver jobs, it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 431 U. S. 356</a></p><p> does so for all.  The city drivers and servicemen who are discouraged from transferring to line driver jobs are not all Negroes or Spanish-surnamed Americans; to the contrary, the overwhelming majority are white.  The placing of line drivers in a separate bargaining unit from other employees is rational, in accord with the industry practice, and consistent with National Labor Relation Board precedents. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  It is conceded that the seniority system did not have its genesis in racial discrimination, and that it was negotiated and has been maintained free from any illegal purpose.  In these circumstances, the single fact that the system extends no retroactive seniority to pre-Act discriminatees does not make it unlawful.</p>\n<p>Because the seniority system was protected by \xc2\xa7 703(h), the union\'s conduct in agreeing to and maintaining the system did not violate Title VII.  On remand, the District Court\'s injunction against the union must be vacated. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the seniority system does not violate Title VII will necessarily affect the remedy granted to individual employees on remand of this litigation to the District Court.  Those employees who suffered only pre-Act discrimination are not entitled to relief, and no person may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 431 U. S. 357</a></p><p> be given retroactive seniority to a date earlier than the effective date of the Act.  Several other questions relating to the appropriate measure of individual relief remain, however, for our consideration.</p>\n<p>The petitioners argue generally that the trial court did not err in tailoring the remedy to the "degree of injury" suffered by each individual employee, and that the Court of Appeals\' "qualification date" formula sweeps with too broad a brush by granting a remedy to employees who were not shown to be actual victims of unlawful discrimination.  Specifically, the petitioners assert that no employee should be entitled to relief until the Government demonstrates that he was an actual victim of the company\'s discriminatory practices; that no employee who did not apply for a line driver job should be granted retroactive competitive seniority; and that no employee should be elevated to a line driver job ahead of any current line driver on layoff status.  We consider each of these contentions separately.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The petitioners\' first contention is in substance that the Government\'s burden of proof in a "pattern or practice" case must be equivalent to that outlined in <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green.</em>  Since the Government introduced specific evidence of company discrimination against only some 40 employees, they argue that the District Court properly refused to award retroactive seniority to the remainder of the class of minority incumbent employees.</p>\n<p>In <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> the Court considered "the order and allocation of proof in a private, non-class action challenging employment discrimination."  411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/792/case.html#800">411 U. S. 800</a></span>.  We held that an individual Title VII complainant must carry the initial burden of proof by establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case of racial discrimination.  On the specific facts there involved, we concluded that this burden was met by showing that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 431 U. S. 358</a></p><p> qualified applicant, who was a member of a racial minority group, had unsuccessfully sought a job for which there was a vacancy and for which the employer continued thereafter to seek applicants with similar qualifications.  This initial showing justified the inference that the minority applicant was denied an employment opportunity for reasons prohibited by Title VII, and therefore shifted the burden to the employer to rebut that inference by offering some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the rejection.  <em>Id.</em> at 802.</p>\n<p>The company and union seize upon the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> pattern as the only means of establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case of individual discrimination.  Our decision in that case, however, did not purport to create an inflexible formulation.  We expressly noted that</p>\n<p>"[t]he facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification . . . of the <em>prima facie</em> proof required from [a plaintiff] is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 802 n. 13.  The importance of <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> lies, not in its specification of the discrete elements of proof there required, but in its recognition of the general principle that any Title VII plaintiff must carry the initial burden of offering evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under the Act. [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> the Court applied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 431 U. S. 359</a></p><p> this principle in the context of a class action.  The <em>Franks</em> plaintiffs proved, to the satisfaction of a District Court, that Bowman Transportation Co "had engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination in various company policies, including the hiring, transfer, and discharge of employees."  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#751">424 U. S. 751</a></span>.  Despite this showing, the trial court denied seniority relief to certain members of the class of discriminatees because not every individual had shown that he was qualified for the job he sought and that a vacancy had been available.  We held that the trial court had erred in placing this burden on the individual plaintiffs.  By "demonstrating the existence of a discriminatory hiring pattern and practice," the plaintiffs had made out a <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination against the individual class members; the burden therefore shifted to the employer "to prove that individuals who reapply were not in fact victims of previous hiring discrimination."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#772">424 U. S. 772</a></span>.  The <em>Franks</em> case thus illustrates another means by which a Title VII plaintiff\'s initial burden of proof can be met.  The class there alleged a broad-based policy of employment discrimination; upon proof of that allegation, there were reasonable grounds to infer that individual hiring decisions were made in pursuit of the discriminatory policy, and to require the employer to come forth with evidence dispelling that inference. [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 431 U. S. 360</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although not all class actions will necessarily follow the <em>Franks</em> model, the nature of a "pattern or practice" suit brings it squarely within our holding in <em>Franks.</em>  The plaintiff in a "pattern or practice" action is the Government, and its initial burden is to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination has been a regular procedure or policy followed by an employer or group of employers.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#336">431 U. S. 336</a></span>, and n. 16.  At the initial, "liability" stage of a "pattern or practice" suit  the Government is not required to offer evidence that each person for whom it will ultimately seek relief was a victim of the employer\'s discriminatory policy.  Its burden is to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case that such a policy existed.  The burden then shifts to the employer to defeat the <em>prima facie</em> showing of a pattern or practice by demonstrating that the Government\'s proof is either inaccurate or insignificant.  An employer might show, for example, that the claimed discriminatory pattern is a product of pre-Act hiring rather, than unlawful post-Act discrimination, or that, during the period, it is alleged to have pursued a discriminatory policy it made too few employment decisions to justify the inference that it had engaged in a regular practice of discrimination. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 431 U. S. 361</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If an employer fails to rebut the inference that arises from the Government\'s <em>prima facie</em> case, a trial court may then conclude that a violation has occurred and determine the appropriate remedy.  Without any further evidence from the Government, a court\'s finding of a pattern or practice justifies an award of prospective relief.  Such relief might take the form of an injunctive order against continuation of the discriminatory practice, an order that the employer keep records of its future employment decisions and file periodic reports with the court, or any other order "necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights" protected by Title VII. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>When the Government seeks individual relief for the victims of the discriminatory practice, a district court must usually conduct additional proceedings after the liability phase of the trial to determine the scope of individual relief.  The petitioners\' contention in this case is that, if the Government has not, in the course of proving a pattern or practice, already brought forth specific evidence that each individual was discriminatorily denied an employment opportunity, it must carry that burden at the second, "remedial" stage of trial.  That basic contention was rejected in the <em>Franks</em> case.  As was true of the particular facts in <em>Franks,</em> and as is typical of Title VII "pattern or practice" suits, the question of individual relief does not arise until it has been proved that the employer has followed an employment policy of unlawful discrimination.  The force of that proof does not dissipate at the remedial stage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 431 U. S. 362</a></p><p> of the trial.  The employer cannot, therefore, claim that there is no reason to believe that its individual employment decisions were discriminatorily based; it has already been shown to have maintained a policy of discriminatory decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>The proof of the pattern or practice supports an inference that any particular employment decision, during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in force, was made in pursuit of that policy.  The Government need only show that an alleged individual discriminatee unsuccessfully applied for a job, [<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>] and therefore was a potential victim of the proved discrimination.  As in <em>Franks,</em> the burden then rests on the employer to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.  <em>See</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#773">424 U. S. 773</a></span> n. 32.</p>\n<p>In  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#334">431 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> we have held that the District Court and Court of Appeals were not in error in finding that the Government had proved a systemwide pattern and practice of racial and ethnic discrimination on the part of the company.  On remand, therefore, every post-Act minority group applicant [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>] for a line driver position will be presumptively entitled to relief, subject to a showing by the company that its earlier refusal to place the applicant in a line driver job was not based on its policy of discrimination. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' "qualification date" formula for relief did not distinguish between incumbent employees who </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 431 U. S. 363</a></p><p> had applied for line driver jobs and those who had not.  The appellate court held that, where there has been a showing of classwide discriminatory practices coupled with a seniority system that perpetuates the effects of that discrimination, an individual member of the class need not show that he unsuccessfully applied for the position from which the class had been excluded.  In support of its award of relief to all nonapplicants, the Court suggested that,</p>\n<p>"as a practical matter . . . , a member of the affected class may well have concluded that an application for transfer to an all-White position such as [line driver] was not worth the candle."</p>\n<p>517 F.2d at 320.</p>\n<p>The company contends that a grant of retroactive seniority to these nonapplicants is inconsistent with the make-whole purpose of a Title VII remedy, and impermissibly will require the company to give preferential treatment to employees solely because of their race.  The thrust of the company\'s contention is that, unless a minority group employee actually applied for a line driver job, either for initial hire or for transfer, he has suffered no injury from whatever discrimination might have been involved in the refusal of such jobs to those who actually applied for them.</p>\n<p>The Government argues in response that there should be no "immutable rule" that nonapplicants are nonvictims, and contends that a determination whether nonapplicants have suffered from unlawful discrimination will necessarily vary depending on the circumstances of each particular case.  The Government further asserts that, under the specific facts of this case, the Court of Appeals correctly determined that all qualified nonapplicants were likely victims, and were therefore presumptively entitled to relief.</p>\n<p>The question whether seniority relief may be awarded to nonapplicants was left open by our decision in <em>Franks,</em> since the class at issue in that case was limited to "identifiable applicants who were denied employment . . . after the effective date . . . of Title VII."  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/720/case.html#750">431 U.

S. 364</a></p><p> decide that an incumbent employee\'s failure to apply for a job is not an inexorable bar to an award of retroactive seniority.  Individual nonapplicants must be given an opportunity to undertake their difficult task of proving that they should be treated as applicants, and therefore are presumptively entitled to relief accordingly.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>Analysis of this problem must begin with the premise that the scope of a district court\'s remedial powers under Title VII is determined by the purposes of the Act.  <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v.

The effects of and the injuries suffered from discriminatory employment practices are not always confined to those who were expressly denied a requested employment opportunity.  A consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.</p>\n<p>If an employer should announce his policy of discrimination by a sign reading "Whites only" on the hiring office door, his victims would not be limited to the few who ignored the sign and subjected themselves to personal rebuffs.  The same message can be communicated to potential applicants more subtly, but just as clearly, by an employer\'s actual practice by his consistent discriminatory treatment of actual applicants, by the manner in which he publicizes vacancies, his recruitment techniques, his responses to casual or tentative inquiries, and even by the racial or ethnic composition of that part of his workforce from which he has discriminatorily excluded members of minority groups.

S. 367</a></p><p> 228 F.2d 775 (CA5); <em>NLRB v. Lummus Co.,</em> 210 F.2d 377 (CA5).  Consistent with the NLRA model, several Courts of Appeals have held in Title VII cases that a nonapplicant can be a victim of unlawful discrimination entitled to make-whole relief when an application would have been a useless act serving only to confirm a discriminatee\'s knowledge that the job he wanted was unavailable to him.  <em>Acha v. Beame,</em> 531 F.2d 648, 656 (CA2); <em>Hairston v. McLean Trucking Co.,</em> 520 F.2d 226, 231-233 (CA4); <em>Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc.,</em> 485 F.2d 441, 451 (CA5); <em>United States v. N. L. Industries, Inc.,</em> 479 F.2d 354, 369 (CA8).</p>\n<p>The denial of Title VII relief on the ground that the claimant had not formally applied for the job could exclude from the Act\'s coverage the victims of the most entrenched forms of discrimination.  Victims of gross and pervasive discrimination could be denied relief precisely because the unlawful practices had been so successful as totally to deter job applications from members of minority groups.  A <em>per se</em> prohibition of relief to nonapplicants could thus put beyond the reach of equity the most invidious effects of employment discrimination -- those that extend to the very hope of self-realization.  Such a <em>per se</em> limitation on the equitable powers granted to courts by Title VII would be manifestly inconsistent with the "historic purpose of equity to <em>secur[e] complete justice\'" and with the duty of courts in Title VII cases "`to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past.\'"  <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/case.html#418">422 U. S. 418</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>To conclude that a person\'s failure to submit an application for a job does not inevitably and forever foreclose his entitlement to seniority relief under Title VII is a far cry, however, from holding that nonapplicants are always entitled to such relief.  A nonapplicant must show that he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination.  Because he is necessarily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 431 U. S. 368</a></p><p> claiming that he was deterred from applying for the job by the employer\'s discriminatory practices, his is the not always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices.  <em>Cf. Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">429 U. S. 274</a></span>.  When this burden is met, the nonapplicant is in a position analogous to that of an applicant and is entitled to the presumption discussed in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#357">431 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The Government contends that the evidence it presented in this case at the liability stage of the trial identified all nonapplicants as victims of unlawful discrimination "with a fair degree of specificity," and that the Court of Appeals\' determination that qualified nonapplicants are presumptively entitled to an award of seniority should accordingly be affirmed.  In support of this contention, the Government cites its proof of an extended pattern and practice of discrimination as evidence that an application from a minority employee for a line driver job would have been a vain and useless act.  It further argues that, since the class of nonapplicant discriminatees is limited to incumbent employees, it is likely that every class member was aware of the futility of seeking a line driver job, and was therefore deterred from filing both an initial and a followup application. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 431 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We cannot agree.  While the scope and duration of the company\'s discriminatory policy can leave little doubt that the futility of seeking line driver jobs was communicated to the company\'s minority employees, that in itself is insufficient.  The known prospect of discriminatory rejection shows only that employees who wanted line driving jobs may have been deterred from applying for them.  It does not show which of the nonapplicants actually wanted such jobs, or which possessed the requisite qualifications. [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  There are differences between city and line driving jobs. [<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>] for example, but the desirability of the latter is not so self-evident as to warrant a conclusion that all employees would prefer to be line drivers if given a free choice. [<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  Indeed, a substantial number of white </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 431 U. S. 370</a></p><p> city drivers who were not subjected to the company\'s discriminatory practices were apparently content to retain their city jobs. [<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>In order to fill this evidentiary gap, the Government argues that a nonapplicant\'s current willingness to transfer into a line driver position confirms his past desire for the job.  An employee\'s response to the court-ordered notice of his entitlement to relief [<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>] demonstrates, according to this argument, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 431 U. S. 371</a></p><p> the employee would have sought a line driver job when he first became qualified to fill one, but for his knowledge of the company\'s discriminatory policy.</p>\n<p>This assumption falls short of satisfying the appropriate burden of proof.  An employee who transfers into a line driver unit is normally placed at the bottom of the seniority "board."  He is thus in jeopardy of being laid off, and must, at best, suffer through an initial period of bidding on only the least desirable runs.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#343">431 U. S. 343</a></span>-344, and n. 25.  Nonapplicants who chose to accept the appellate court\'s <em>post hoc</em> invitation, however, would enter the line driving unit with retroactive seniority dating from the time they were first qualified.  A willingness to accept the job security and bidding power afforded by retroactive seniority says little about what choice an employee would have made had he previously been given the opportunity freely to choose a starting line driver job.  While it may be true that many of the nonapplicant employees desired and would have applied for line driver jobs but.for their knowledge of the company\'s policy of discrimination, the Government must carry its burden of proof, with respect to each specific individual, at the remedial hearings to be conducted by the District Court on remand. [<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The task remaining for the District Court on remand will not be a simple one.  Initially, the court will have to make a substantial number of individual determinations in deciding which of the minority employees were actual victims </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 431 U. S. 372</a></p><p> of the company\'s discriminatory practices.  After the victims have been identified, the court must, as nearly as possible, "<em>recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no\'" unlawful discrimination.  <em>Franks,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#769">424 U. S. 769</a></span>.  This process of recreating the past will necessarily involve a degree of approximation and imprecision.  Because the class of victims may include some who did not apply for line driver jobs as well as those who did, and because more than one minority employee may have been denied each line driver vacancy, the court will be required to balance the equities of each minority employee\'s situation in allocating the limited number of vacancies that were discriminatorily refused to class members.\n</em></p>\n<p>Moreover, after the victims have been identified and their rightful place determined, the District Court will again be faced with the delicate task of adjusting the remedial interests of discriminatees and the legitimate expectations of other employees innocent of any wrongdoing.  In the prejudgment consent decree, <em>see</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra,</em> the company and the Government agreed that minority employees would assume line driver positions that had been discriminatorily denied to them by exercising a first-priority right to job vacancies at the company\'s terminals.  The decree did not determine what constituted a vacancy, but, in its final order, the trial court defined "vacancy" to exclude any position that became available while there were laid-off employees awaiting an opportunity to return to work.  Employees on layoff were given a preference to fill whatever openings might occur at their terminals during a three-year period after they were laid off. [<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 431 U. S. 373</a></p><p> The Court of Appeals rejected the preference and held that all but "purely temporary" vacancies were to be filled according to an employee\'s seniority, whether as a member of the class </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 431 U. S. 374</a></p><p> discriminated against or as an incumbent line driver on layoff.  517 F.2d at 322-323.</p>\n<p>As their final contention concerning the remedy, the company and the union argue that the trial court correctly made the adjustment between the competing interests of discriminatees and other employees by granting a preference to laid-off employees, and that the Court of Appeals erred in disturbing it.  The petitioners therefore urge the reinstatement of that part of the trial court\'s final order pertaining to the rate at which victims will assume their rightful places in the line driver hierarchy. [<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>]</p>\n<p>Although not directly controlled by the Act, [<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>] the extent to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 431 U. S. 375</a></p><p> which the legitimate expectations of nonvictim employees should determine when victims are restored to their rightful place is limited by basic principles of equity.  In devising and implementing remedies under Title VII, no less than in formulating any equitable decree, a court must draw on the</p>\n<p>"qualities of mercy and practicality [that] have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs, as well as between competing private claims."</p>\n<p><em>Hecht Co. v.

Especially when immediate implementation of an equitable remedy threatens to impinge upon the expectations of innocent parties, the courts must "look to the practical realities and necessities inescapably involved in reconciling competing interests," in order to determine the "special blend of what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable."  <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/192/case.html">411 U.

S. 200</a></span>-201 (opinion of BURGER, C.J.).</p>\n<p>Because of the limited facts now in the record, we decline to strike the balance in this Court.  The District Court did not explain why it subordinated the interests of class members to the contractual recall expectations of other employees on layoff.  When it made that determination, however, it was considering a class of more than 400 minority employees, all of whom had been granted some preference in filling line driver vacancies.  The overwhelming majority of these were in the District Court\'s subclass three, composed of those employees with respect to whom neither the Government nor the company had presented any specific evidence on the question of unlawful discrimination.  Thus, when the court considered the problem of what constituted a line driver "vacancy" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 431 U. S. 376</a></p><p> to be offered to class members, it may have been influenced by the relatively small number of proved victims and the large number of minority employees about whom it had no information.  On the other hand, the Court of Appeals redefined "vacancy" in the context of what it believed to be a class of more than 400 employees who had actually suffered from discrimination at the behest of both the company and the union, and its determination may well have been influenced by that understanding.  For the reasons discussed in this opinion, neither court\'s concept was completely valid.</p>\n<p>After the evidentiary hearings to be conducted on remand, both the size and the composition of the class of minority employees entitled to relief may be altered substantially.  Until those hearings have been conducted and both the number of identifiable victims and the consequent extent of necessary relief have been determined, it is not possible to evaluate abstract claims concerning the equitable balance that should be struck between the statutory rights of victims and the contractual rights of nonvictim employees.  That determination is best left, in the first instance, to the sound equitable discretion of the trial court. [<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]  <em>See Franks v.

All of these employees were represented by the petitioner union.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Following the receipt of evidence, but before decision, the Government and the company consented to the entry of a Decree in Partial Resolution of Suit.  The consent decree did not constitute an adjudication on the merits.  The company agreed, however, to undertake a minority recruiting program; to accept applications from all Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans who inquired about employment, whether or not vacancies existed, and to keep such applications on file and notify applicants of job openings; to keep specific employment and recruiting records open to inspection by the Government and to submit quarterly reports to the District Court; and to adhere to certain uniform employment qualifications respecting hiring and promotion to line driver and other jobs.</p>\n<p>The decree further provided that future job vacancies at any company terminal would be filled first</p>\n<p>"[b]y those persons who may be found by the Court, if any, to be individual or class discriminatees suffering the present effects of past discrimination because of race or national origin prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."</p>\n<p>Any remaining vacancies could be filled by "any other persons," but the company obligated itself to hire one Negro or Spanish-surnamed person for every white person hired at any terminal until the percentage of minority workers at that terminal equaled the percentage of minority group members in the population of the metropolitan area surrounding the terminal.  Finally, the company agreed to pay $89,500 in full settlement of any backpay obligations.  Of this sum, individual payments not exceeding $1,500 were to be paid to "alleged individual and class discriminatees" identified by the Government.</p>\n<p>The Decree in Partial Resolution of Suit narrowed the scope of the litigation, but the District Court still had to determine whether unlawful discrimination had occurred.  If so, the court had to identify the actual discriminatees entitled to fill future job vacancies under the decree.  The validity of the collective bargaining contracts seniority system also remained for decision, as did the question whether any discriminatees should be awarded additional equitable relief such as retroactive seniority.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s memorandum decision is reported at 6 FEP Cases 690 (1974) and 6 EPD \xef\xbf\xbd  8979 (1973-1974).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government did not seek relief for Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans hired at a particular terminal after the date on which that terminal first employed a minority group member as a line driver.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>If an employee in this class had joined the company after July 2, 1965, then the date of his initial employment, rather than the effective date of Title VII was to determine his competitive seniority.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>As with the other subclasses, there were a few individuals in the third group who were found to have been discriminated against with respect to jobs other than line driver.

Under the Southern Conference Area Over-the-Road Supplemental Agreement between the employer and the union, line drivers employed at terminals in certain Southern States work under a "modified" seniority system.  Under the modified system, an employee\'s seniority is not confined strictly to his home terminal.  If he is laid off at his Home terminal, he can move to another terminal covered by the Agreement and retain his seniority, either by filling a vacancy at the other terminal or by "bumping" a junior line driver out of his job if there is no vacancy.  The modified system also requires that any new vacancy at a covered terminal be offered to laid-off line drivers at all other covered terminals before it is filled by any other person.  The District Court\'s final decree, as amended slightly by the Court of Appeals, 517 F.2d 299, 323, altered this system by requiring that any vacancy be offered to all members of all three subclasses before it may be filled by laid-off line drivers from other terminals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case did not specifically mention the requirement that a vacancy exist, it is clear from earlier and later opinions of that court that this requirement is a part of the Fifth Circuit\'s "qualification date" formula.  <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight,</em> 505 F.2d 40, 63 n. 29, <em>rev\'d on other grounds, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/395/case.html">431 U.

If he became qualified or if a vacancy opened up only at a later date, then that later date would be used.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also approved (with slight modification) the part of the District Court\'s order that allowed class members to fill vacancies at a particular terminal ahead of line drivers laid off at other terminals.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e 2(a) (1970 ed. and Supp. V), provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\'s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or"</p>\n<p>"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\'s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>"Disparate treatment" such as is alleged in the present case is the most easily understood type of discrimination.  The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences in treatment.  <em>See, e.g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/case.html">429 U.

Undoubtedly disparate treatment was the most obvious evil Congress had in mind when it enacted Title VII.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 110 Cong.Rec. 13088 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey) ("What the bill does . . . is simply to make it an illegal practice to use race as a factor in denying employment.  It provides that men and women shall be employed on the basis of their qualifications, not as Catholic citizens, not as Protestant citizens, not as Jewish citizens, not as colored citizens, but as citizens of the United States").</p>\n<p>Claims of disparate treatment may be distinguished from claims that stress "disparate impact."  The latter involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups, but that, in fact, fall more harshly on one group than another, and cannot be justified by business necessity.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#349">431 U.

The company\'s Atlanta terminal employed 57 line drivers.  All were white.  In Los Angeles, 10.84% of the greater metropolitan population and 17.88% of the city population were Negro.  But at the company\'s two Los Angeles terminals, there was not a single Negro among the 374 line drivers.

In 1968, after hearing that a white city driver had transferred to a line driver job, he told the terminal manager that he also would like to consider line driving.  The manager replied that there would be "a lot of problems on the road . . . with different people, Caucasian, <em>et cetera,</em>" and stated:  "I don\'t feel that the company is ready for this right now. . . .  Give us a little time.  It will come around, you know."  Mr. Taylor made similar requests some months later and got similar responses.  He was never offered a line driving job or an application.</p>\n<p>Feliberto Trujillo worked as a dockman at the company\'s Denver terminal.  When he applied for a line driver job in 1967, he was told by a personnel officer that he had one strike against him.  He asked what that was and was told:  "You\'re a Chicano, and as far as we know, there isn\'t a Chicano driver in the system."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that statistics, at least those comparing the racial composition of an employer\'s workforce to the composition of the population at large, should never be given decisive weight in a Title VII case because to do so would conflict with \xc2\xa7 703(j) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e 2(j).  That section provides:</p>\n<p>"Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require any employer . . . to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the race . . . or national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of any race . . . or national origin employed by any employer . . . in comparison with, the total number or percentage of persons of such race . . . or national origin in any community, State, section, or other area, or in the available workforce in any community, State, section, or other area."</p>\n<p>The argument fails in this case because the statistical evidence was not offered or used to support an erroneous theory that Title VII requires an employer\'s workforce to be racially balanced.  Statistics showing racial or ethnic imbalance are probative in a case such as this one only because such imbalance is often a telltale sign of purposeful discrimination; absent explanation, it is ordinarily to be expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will, in time, result in a workforce more or less representative of the racial and ethnic composition of the population in the community from which employees are hired.  Evidence of long-lasting and gross disparity between the composition of a workforce and that of the general population thus may be significant even though \xc2\xa7 703(j) makes clear that Title VII imposes no requirement that a workforce mirror the general population.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sheet Metal Workers Local 36,</em> 416 F.2d 123, 127 n. 7 (CA8).  Considerations such as small sample size may, of course, detract from the value of such evidence, <em>see, e.g., Mayor of Philadelphia v.

None was a Negro.  Government Exhibit 204.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, in 1971, the company hired 116 new line drivers, of whom 16 were Negro or Spanish-surnamed Americans.  Minority employees composed 7.1% of the company\'s systemwide workforce in 1967 and 10.5% in 1972.  Minority hiring increased greatly in 1972 and 1973, presumably due at least in part to the existence of the consent decree.  <em>See</em> 517 F.2d at 316 n.31.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The company\'s narrower attacks upon the statistical evidence -- that there was no precise delineation of the areas referred to in the general population statistics, that the Government did not demonstrate that minority populations were located close to terminals or that transportation was available, that the statistics failed to show what portion of the minority population was suited by age, health, or other qualifications to hold trucking jobs, etc. -- are equally lacking in force.  At best, these attacks go only to the accuracy of the comparison between the composition of the company\'s workforce at various terminals and the general population of the surrounding communities.  They detract little from the Government\'s further showing that Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans who were hired were overwhelmingly excluded from line driver jobs.  Such employees were willing to work, had access to the terminal, were healthy and of working age, and often were at least sufficiently qualified to hold city driver jobs.  Yet they became line drivers with far less frequency than whites.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Pretrial Stipulation 14, summarized in 517 F.2d at 312 n. 24 (of 2,919 whites who held driving jobs in 1971, 1,802 (62%) were line drivers and 1,117 (38%) were city drivers; of 180 Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans who held driving jobs, 13 (7%) were line drivers and 167 (93%) were city drivers).</p>\n<p>In any event, fine tuning of the statistics could not have obscured the glaring absence of minority line drivers.  As the Court of Appeals remarked, the company\'s inability to rebut the inference of discrimination came not from a misuse of statistics but from "the inexorable zero."  <em>Id.</em> at 315.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The company\'s evidence, apart from the showing of recent changes in hiring and promotion policies, consisted mainly of general statements that it hired only the best qualified applicants.  But "affirmations of good faith in making individual selections are insufficient to dispel a <em>prima facie</em> case of systematic exclusion."  <em>Alexander v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/625/case.html">405 U.

The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the trial judge was not bound to accept this testimony and that it committed no error by relying instead on the other overpowering evidence in the case.  517 F.2d at 315.  The Court of Appeals was also correct in the view that individual proof concerning each class member\'s specific injury was appropriately left to proceedings to determine individual relief.  In a suit brought by the Government under \xc2\xa7 707(a) of the Act the District Court\'s initial concern is in deciding whether the Government has proved that the defendant has engaged m a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#360">431 U.

The best runs are chosen by the line drivers at the top of the "board" -- a list of drivers arranged in order of their bargaining unit seniority.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Both bargaining unit seniority and company seniority rights are generally limited to service at one particular terminal, except as modified by the Southern Conference Area Over-the-Road Supplemental Agreement.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>An example would be a Negro who was qualified to be a line driver in 1958 but who, because of his race, was assigned instead a job as a city driver, and is allowed to become a line driver only in 1971.  Because he loses his competitive seniority when he transfers jobs, he is forever junior to white line drivers hired between 1958 and 1970.  The whites, rather than the Negro, will henceforth enjoy the preferable\' runs and the greater protection against layoff.  Although the original discrimination occurred in 1958 -- before the effective date of Title VII -- the seniority system operates to carry the effects of the earlier discrimination into the present.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Concededly, the view that \xc2\xa7 703(h) does not immunize seniority systems that perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination has much support.  It was apparently first adopted in <em>Quarles v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</em> 279 F.Supp. 505 (ED Va.).  The court there held that "a departmental seniority system <em>that has its genesis in racial discrimination</em> is not a bona fide seniority system."  <em>Id.</em> at 517 (first emphasis added).  The <em>Quarles</em> view has since enjoyed wholesale adoption in the Courts of Appeals.  <em>See, e.g., Local 189, United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers v. United States,</em> 416 F.2d 980, 987-988 (CA5); <em>United States v. Sheet Metal Workers Local 6,</em> 416 F.2d at 133-134, n. 20; <em>United States v.

Insofar as the result in <em>Quarles</em> and in the cases that followed it depended upon findings that the seniority systems were themselves "racially discriminatory" or had their "genesis in racial discrimination," 279 F.Supp. at 517, the decisions can be viewed as resting upon the proposition that a seniority system that perpetuates the effects of pre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to discriminate entered into its very adoption.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Article 38 of the National Master Freight Agreement between the company and the union in effect as of the date of the systemwide lawsuit provided:</p>\n<p>"The Employer and the Union agree not to discriminate against any individual with respect to his hiring, compensation, terms or conditions of employment because of such individual\'s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, nor will they limit, segregate or classify employees in any way to deprive any individual employee of employment opportunities because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."</p>\n<p>Any discrimination by the company would apparently be a "grievable" breach of this provision of the contract.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>The legality of the seniority system insofar as it perpetuates post-Act discrimination nonetheless remains at issue in this case, in light of the injunction entered against the union.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#331">431 U.

S. 553</a></span>, is largely dispositive of this issue.  <em>Evans</em> holds that the operation of a seniority system is not unlawful under Title VII even though it perpetuates post-Act discrimination that has not been the subject of a timely charge by the discriminatee.  Here, of course, the government has sued to remedy the post-Act discrimination directly, and there is no claim that any relief would be time-barred.  But this is simply an additional reason not to hold the seniority system unlawful, since such a holding would in no way enlarge the relief to be awarded.  <em>See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U.

Would the same situation prevail in respect to promotions, when that management function is governed by a labor contract calling for promotions on the basis of seniority?  What of dismissals?

Seniority rights are in no way affected by the bill.  If, under a \'last hired, first fired\' agreement a Negro happens to be the \'last hired,\' he can still be \'first fired\' as long as it is done because of his status as \'last hired,\' and not because of his race."</p>\n<p>110 Cong.Rec. 7217 (1964).  <em>See Franks, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#760">424 U.

In this regard the language of the Justice Department memorandum introduced at the legislative hearings, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#351">431 U.

As the discussion in <em>Franks</em> indicates, that history is itself susceptible of different readings.  The few broad references to perpetuation of pre-Act discrimination or "<em>de facto</em> segregated job ladders," <em>see, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 92-415, pp. 5, 9 (1971); H.R.Rep. No. 92-238, pp. 8, 17 (1971), did not address the specific issue presented by this case.  And the assumption of the authors of the Conference Report that "the present case law as developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability and construction of Title VII," <em>see Franks, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#76">424 U. S. 765</a></span> n. 21, of course does not foreclose our consideration of that issue.  More importantly, the section of Title VII that we construe here, \xc2\xa7 703(h), was enacted in 1964, not 1972.  The views of members of a later Congress, concerning different sections of Title VII, enacted after this litigation was commenced, are entitled to little if any weight.  It is the intent of the Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7 703(h) in 1964, unmistakable in this case, that controls.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T40" name="F40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>That Title VII did not proscribe the denial of fictional seniority to pre-Act discriminatees who got no job was recognized even in <em>Quarles v.

In <em>Local 189, United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers v. United States,</em> 416 F.2d 980 (CA5), another leading case in this area, the court observed:</p>\n<p>"No doubt, Congress, to prevent \'reverse discrimination\' meant to protect certain seniority rights that could not have existed but for previous racial discrimination.  For example a Negro who had been rejected by an employer on racial grounds before passage of the Act could not, after being hired, claim to outrank whites who had been hired before him but after his original rejection, even though the Negro might have had senior status but for the past discrimination."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 994.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T41" name="F41">Footnote 41</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, there is no reason to suppose that Congress intended in 1964 to extend less protection to legitimate departmental seniority systems than to plant-wide seniority systems.  Then, as now, seniority was measured in a number of ways, including length of time with the employer, in a particular plant, in a department, in a job, or in a line of progression.  <em>See</em> Aaron, Reflections on the Legal Nature and Enforceability of seniority Rights, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 1532, 1534 (1962); Cooper &amp; Sobol, seniority and Testing under Fair Employment Laws:  A General Approach to Objective Criteria of Hiring and Promotion, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1598, 1602 (1969).

An employer\'s isolated decision to reject an applicant who belongs to a racial minority does not show that the rejection was racially based.  Although the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em> formula does not require direct proof of discrimination, it does demand that the alleged discriminatee demonstrate at least that his rejection did not result from the two most common legitimate reasons on which an employer might rely to reject a job applicant:  an absolute or relative lack of qualifications or the absence of a vacancy in the job sought.  Elimination of these reasons for the refusal to hire is sufficient, absent other explanation, to create an inference that the decision was a discriminatory one.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T45" name="F45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p>The holding in <em>Franks</em> that proof of a discriminatory pattern and practice creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of individual relief is consistent with the manner in which presumptions are created generally.  Presumptions shifting the burden of proof are often created to reflect judicial evaluations of probabilities and to conform with a party\'s superior access to the proof.  <em>See</em> C. McCormick, Law of Evidence \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 337, 343 (2d ed 1972); James, Burdens of Proof, 47 Va.L.Rev. 51, 61 (1961).  <em>See also Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/189/case.html">413 U. S. 189</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/189/case.html#208">413 U. S. 208</a></span>-209.   These factors were present in <em>Franks.</em>  Although the <em>prima facie</em> case did not conclusively demonstrate that all of the employer\'s decisions were part of the proved discriminatory pattern and practice, it did create a greater likelihood that any single decision was a component of the overall pattern.  Moreover, the finding of a pattern or practice changed the position of the employer to that of a proved wrongdoer.  Finally, the employer was in the best position to show why any individual employee was denied an employment opportunity.  Insofar as the reasons related to available vacancies or the employer\'s evaluation of the applicant\'s qualifications, the company\'s records were the most relevant items of proof.  If the refusal to hire was based on other factors, the employer and its agents knew best what those factors were and the extent to which they influenced the decisionmaking process.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T46" name="F46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>The employer\'s defense must, of course, be designed to meet the <em>prima facie</em> case of the Government.  We do not mean to suggest that there are any particular limits on the type of evidence a employer may use.  The point is that, at the liability stage of a "pattern or practice" trial, the focus often will not be on individual hiring decisions, but on a pattern of discriminatory decisionmaking.  While a pattern might be demonstrated by examining the discrete decisions of which it is composed, the Government\'s suits have more commonly involved proof of the expected result of a regularly followed discriminatory policy.  In such cases, the employer\'s burden is to provide a nondiscriminatory explanation for the apparently discriminatory result.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F20" name="T20">n</a> 20, <em>supra,</em> and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T47" name="F47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>The federal courts have freely exercised their broad equitable discretion to devise prospective relief designed to assure that employers found to be in violation of \xc2\xa7 707(a) eliminate their discriminatory practices and the effects therefrom.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> cases cited in  <a href="#F51" name="T51">n</a> 51, <em>infra.</em>  In this case, prospective relief was incorporated in the parties\' consent decree.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T48" name="F48">Footnote 48</a>]</p>\n<p>Nonapplicants are discussed in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#362">431 U.

Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> 495 F.2d 398, 418-419 (CA5) (public recruitment and advertising), <em>rev\'d on other grounds,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html">424 U.

Jacksonville Terminal Co.,</em> 451 F.2d at 458 (posting of job vacancies and job qualification requirements); <em>United States v.

While these measures may be effective in preventing the deterrence of future applicants, they afford no relief to those persons who in the past desired jobs but were intimidated and discouraged by employment discrimination.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T52" name="F52">Footnote 52</a>]</p>\n<p>The limitation to incumbent employees is also said to serve the same function that actual job applications served in <em>Franks:</em>  providing a means of distinguishing members of the excluded minority group from minority members of the public at large.  While it is true that incumbency in this case and actual applications in <em>Franks</em> both serve to narrow what might otherwise be an impossible task, the statuses of nonincumbent applicant and nonapplicant incumbent differ substantially.  The refused applicants in <em>Franks</em> had been denied an opportunity they clearly sought, and the only issue to be resolved was whether the denial was pursuant to a proved discriminatory practice.  Resolution of the\' nonapplicant\'s claim, however, requires two distinct determinations:  that he would have applied but for discrimination and that he would have been discriminatorily rejected had he applied.  The mere fact of incumbency does not resolve the first issue, although it may tend to support a nonapplicant\'s claim to the extent that it shows he was willing and competent to work as a driver, that he was familiar with the tasks of line drivers, etc.  An incumbent\'s claim that he would have applied for a line driver job would certainly be more superficially plausible than a similar claim by a member of the general public who may never have worked in the trucking industry or heard of the company prior to suit.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T53" name="F53">Footnote 53</a>]</p>\n<p>Inasmuch as the purpose of the nonapplicant\'s burden of proof will be to establish that his status is similar to that of the applicant, he must bear the burden of coming forward with the basic information about his qualifications that he would have presented in an application.  As in <em>Franks,</em> and in accord with  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#357">431 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> the burden then will be on the employer to show that the nonapplicant was nevertheless not a victim of discrimination.  For example, the employer might show that there were other, more qualified persons who would have been chosen for a particular vacancy, or that the nonapplicant\'s stated qualifications were insufficient.  <em>See Franks,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#773">424 U. S. 773</a></span> n. 32.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T54" name="F54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>Of the employees for whom the Government sought transfer to line driving jobs, nearly one-third held city driver positions</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T55" name="F55">Footnote 55</a>]</p>\n<p>The company\'s line drivers generally earned more annually than its city drivers, but the difference varied from under $1,000 to more than $5,000 depending on the terminal and the year.  In 1971, city drivers at two California terminals, "LOS" and San Francisco, earned substantially more than the line drivers at those terminals.  In addition to earnings, line drivers have the advantage of not being required to load and unload their trucks.  City drivers, however, have regular working hours, are not required to spend extended periods away from home and family, and do not face the hazards of long distance driving at high speeds.  As the Government acknowledged at argument, the jobs are in some sense "parallel" -- some may prefer one job and some may prefer another.</p>\n<p>The District Court found generally that line driver jobs "are considered the most desirable of the driving jobs."  That finding is not challenged here, and we see no reason to disturb it.  We observe only that the differences between city and line driving were not such that it can be said with confidence that all minority employees free from the threat of discriminatory treatment would have chosen to give up city for line driving.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T56" name="F56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to the futility of application, the Court of Appeals seems to have relied on the minority employees\' accumulated seniority in non-line driver positions in concluding that nonapplicants had been unlawfully deterred from applying.  <em>See</em> 517 F.2d at 318, 320.  The Government adopts that theory here, arguing that a nonapplicant who has accrued time at the company would be unlikely to have applied for transfer because he would have had to forfeit all of his competitive seniority and the job security that went with it.  In view of our conclusion in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#343">431 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> this argument detracts from, rather than supports, a nonapplicant\'s entitlement to relief.  To the extent that an incumbent was deterred from applying by his desire to retain his competitive seniority, he simply did not want a line driver job requiring him to start at the bottom of the "board."  Those nonapplicants who did not apply for transfer because they were unwilling to give up their previously acquired seniority suffered only from a lawful deterrent imposed on all employees regardless of race or ethnicity.  The nonapplicant\'s remedy in such cases is limited solely to the relief, if any, to which he may be entitled because of the discrimination he encountered at a time when he wanted to take a starting line driver job.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T57" name="F57">Footnote 57</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s final order required that the company notify each minority employee of the relief he was entitled to claim.   The employee was then required to indicate, within 60 days, his willingness to accept the relief.  Under the decision of the Court of Appeals, the relief would be qualification date seniority.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T58" name="F58">Footnote 58</a>]</p>\n<p>While the most convincing proof would be some overt act, such as a pre-Act application for a line driver job, the District Court may find evidence of an employee\'s informal inquiry, expression of interest, or even unexpressed desire credible and convincing.  The question is a factual one for determination by the trial judge.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T59" name="F59">Footnote 59</a>]</p>\n<p>Paragraph 9(a) of the trial court\'s final order provided:</p>\n<p>"A \'vacancy,\' as used in this Order, shall include any opening which is caused by the transfer or promotion to a position outside the bargaining unit, death, resignation or final discharge of an incumbent, or by an increase in operations or business where, ordinarily, additional employees would be put to work.  A vacancy shall not exist where there are laid off employees on the seniority roster where the opening occurs.  Such laid-off employees shall have a preference to fill such laid off positions when these again become open without competition from the individuals granted relief in this case.  However, if such layoff continues for three consecutive years the position will be deemed as \'vacant\' with the right of all concerned to compete for the position, using their respective seniority dates, including those provided for in this Order."</p>\n<p>The trial court\'s use of a three-year recall right is apparently derived from provisions in the collective bargaining agreements.  Article 5 of the National Master Freight Agreement (NMFA) establishes the seniority rights of employees covered by the Agreement.  Under Art. 5,</p>\n<p>"[s]eniority rights for employees shall prevail. . . .  Seniority shall only be broken by discharge, voluntary quit, [or] more than a three(3) year layoff."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1.  As is evident, the three-year layoff provision in the NMFA determines only when an employee shall lose <em>all</em> of his accumulated seniority; it does not determine either the order of layoff or the order of recall.  Subject to other terms of the NMFA, Art. 2, \xc2\xa7 2, "[t]he extent to which seniority shall be applied as well as the methods and procedures of such application" are left to the Supplemental Agreements.  Art. 5, \xc2\xa7 1.  The Southern Conference Area Over-the-Road Supplemental Agreement, covering line drivers in the Southern Conference, also provides for a complete loss of seniority rights after a three-year layoff, Art. 42, \xc2\xa7 1, and further provides that, in the event of a reduction in force, "the last employee hired shall be laid off first and when the force is again increased, the employees are to be returned to work in the reverse order in which they were laid off," Art. 42, \xc2\xa7 3.</p>\n<p>This order of layoff and recall, however, is limited by the NMFA in at least two situations involving an influx of employees from outside a terminal.  Art. 5, \xc2\xa7 3(a)(1) (merger with a solvent company), \xc2\xa7 5(b)(2) (branch closing with transfer of operations to another branch).  In these cases the NMFA provides for "dovetailing" the seniority rights of active and laid-off employees at the two facilities involved.  <em>Ibid.; see also</em> NMFA, Art 15 (honoring Military Selective Service Act of 1967).  The NMFA also recognizes that "questions of accrual, interpretation or application of seniority rights may arise which are not covered by the general rules set forth," and provides a procedure for resolution of unforeseen seniority problems.  Art. 5, \xc2\xa7 7.  Presumably \xc2\xa7 7 applies to persons claiming discriminatory denial of jobs and seniority in violation of Art. 38, which prohibits discrimination in hiring as well as classification of employees so as to deprive them of employment opportunities on account of race or national origin.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F29" name="T29">n</a> 29, <em>supra.</em>  The District Court apparently did not consider these provisions when it determined the recall rights of employees on layoff.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T60" name="F60">Footnote 60</a>]</p>\n<p>In their briefs, the petitioners also challenge the trial court\'s modification of the inter-terminal transfer rights of line drivers in the Southern Conference.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  This question was not presented in either petition for certiorari, and therefore is not properly before us.  This Court\'s Rule 23(1)(c).  Our disposition of the claim that is presented, however, will permit the trial court to reconsider any part of the balance it struck in dealing with this issue.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T61" name="F61">Footnote 61</a>]</p>\n<p>The petitioners argue that to permit a victim of discrimination to use his rightful place seniority to bid on a line driver job before the recall of all employees on layoff would amount to a racial or ethnic preference in violation of \xc2\xa7 703(j) of the Act.  Section 703(j) provides no support for this argument.  It provides only that Title VII does not require an employer to grant preferential treatment to any group in order to rectify an imbalance between the composition of the employer\'s workforce and the makeup of the population at large.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F20" name="T20">n</a> 20, <em>supra.</em>  To allow identifiable victims of unlawful discrimination to participate in a layoff recall is not the kind of "preference" prohibited by \xc2\xa7 703(j).  If a discriminatee is ultimately allowed to secure a position before a laid-off line driver, a question we do not now decide, he will do so because of the bidding power inherent in his rightful place seniority, and not because of a preference based on race.  <em>See Franks,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#792">424 U.

The evils against which it is aimed are defined broadly:</p>\n<p>"to fail . . . to hire or to discharge . . . <em>or otherwise to discriminate</em> . . . with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,"</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>"to limit, segregate, or classify . . . <em>in any way</em> which would deprive <em>or tend to deprive</em> any individual of employment opportunities <em>or otherwise adversely affect his status.</em>"</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a) (1970 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added).  Section 703(h) carves out an exemption from these broad prohibitions.  Accordingly, under longstanding principles of statutory construction, the Act should "be given a liberal interpretation . . . [and] exemptions from its sweep should be narrowed and limited to effect the remedy intended."  <em>Piedmont &amp; Northern R. Co. v.

Unless a seniority system that perpetuates discrimination falls "plainly and unmistakably within [the] terms and spirit" of \xc2\xa7 703(h), <em>A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/324/490/case.html">324 U.

I submit that whatever else may be true of the section, its applicability to systems that perpetuate past discrimination is not "plainly and unmistakably" clear.</p>\n<p>The language of \xc2\xa7 703(h) provides anything but clear support for the Court\'s holding.  That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"[I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards, of compensation, or different terms, conditions or privileges of employment pursuant to a <em>bona fide</em> seniority . . . system . . . <em>provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 431 U.

Thus, if the proviso is read literally, the instant case falls squarely within it, thereby rendering \xc2\xa7 703(h) inapplicable.  To avoid this result, the Court is compelled to reconstruct the proviso to read:  provided that such a seniority system "did not have its genesis in racial discrimination, and that it was negotiated and has been maintained free from any illegal purpose."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#356">431 U.

The three documents placed in the Congressional Record by Senator Clark concerning seniority all were written many weeks before the Mansfield-Dirksen amendment containing \xc2\xa7 703(h) was introduced.  Accordingly, they do not specifically discuss the meaning of the proviso. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  More importantly, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 431 U. S. 383</a></p><p> none of the documents addresses the general problem of seniority systems that perpetuate discrimination.  Not surprisingly, Congress simply did not think of such subtleties in enacting a comprehensive, pathbreaking Civil Rights Act. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  To my mind, this is dispositive.  Absent unambiguous statutory language or an authoritative statement in the legislative history legalizing seniority systems that continue past wrongs, I do not see how it can be said that the \xc2\xa7 703(h) exemption "plainly and unmistakably" applies.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if I were to agree that this case properly can be decided on the basis of inferences as to Congress\' intent, I still could not accept the Court\'s holding.  In my view, the legislative history of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not support the conclusion that Congress intended to legalize seniority systems that perpetuate discrimination, and administrative, and legislative developments since 1964 positively refute that conclusion.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision to uphold seniority systems that perpetuate post-Act discrimination -- that is, seniority systems that treat Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans who become line drivers as new employees even though, after the effective date of Title VII, these persons were discriminatorily assigned to city driver jobs where they accumulated seniority -- is explained in a single footnote.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#348">431 U. S. 348</a></span> n. 30.  That footnote relies almost entirely on <em>United Air Lines, Inc.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 431 U. S. 384</a></p><p> <em>v. Evans, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html#552">431 U. S. 553</a></span>.  But like the instant decision, <em>Evans</em> is devoid of any analysis of the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 703(h); it simply asserts its conclusion in a single paragraph.  For the Court to base its decision here on the strength of <em>Evans</em> is sheer bootstrapping.</p>\n<p>Had the Court objectively examined the legislative history, it would have been compelled to reach the opposite conclusion.  As we stated just last Term, "it is apparent that the thrust of [\xc2\xa7 703(h)] is directed toward defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination <em>occurring prior to the effective date of the Act.</em>" [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co.,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/747/case.html#761">424 U. S. 761</a></span> (emphasis added).  Congress was concerned with seniority expectations that had developed prior to the enactment of Title VII, not with expectations arising thereafter to the extent that those expectations were dependent on whites benefiting from unlawful discrimination.  Thus, the paragraph of the Clark-Case Interpretive Memorandum dealing with seniority systems begins:</p>\n<p>"Title VII would have no effect on established seniority rights.  <em>Its effect is prospective, and not retrospective.</em>"</p>\n<p>110 Cong.Rec. 7213 (1964) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Justice Department memorandum that Senator Clark introduced explains:</p>\n<p>"Title VII would have no effect on seniority rights existing <em>at the time it takes effect.</em>  If, for example a collective bargaining contract provides that, in the event of layoffs, those who were hired last must be laid off first, such a provision would not be affected . . . by title VII.  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 431 U. S. 385</a></p><p> would be true even in the case where, <em>owing to discrimination prior to the effective date of the title,</em> white workers had more seniority than Negroes . . .  Any differences in treatment based on <em>established</em> seniority rights would not be based on race, and would not be forbidden by the title."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7207 (emphasis added).  Finally, Senator Clark\'s prepared answers to questions propounded by Senator Dirksen stated:</p>\n<p>"Question.  If an employer is directed to abolish his employment list because of discrimination what happens to seniority?"</p>\n<p>"Answer.  <em>The bill is not retroactive,</em> and it will not require an employer to change existing seniority lists."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7217 (emphasis added).  For the Court to ignore this history while reaching a conclusion contrary to it is little short of remarkable.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 703(h) admittedly affords somewhat stronger support for the Court\'s conclusion with respect to seniority systems that perpetuate pre-Act discrimination -- that is, seniority systems that treat Negroes and Spanish-surnamed Americans who become line drivers as new employees even though these persons were discriminatorily assigned to city driver jobs where they accumulated seniority before the effective date of Title VII.  In enacting \xc2\xa7 703(h), Congress intended to extend at least some protection to seniority expectations that had developed prior to the effective date of the Act.  But the legislative history is very clear that the only threat to these expectations that Congress was seeking to avert was nonremedial, fictional seniority.  Congress did not want minority group members who were hired after the effective date of the Act to be given superseniority simply because they were members of minority groups, nor did it want the use of seniority to be invalidated whenever it had a disparate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 431 U. S. 386</a></p><p> impact on newly hired minority employees.  These are the evils -- and the only evils -- that the opponents of Title VII raised [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] and that the Clark-Case Interpretive Memorandum addressed. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  As the Court acknowledges, "there seems to be no explicit reference in the legislative history to pre-Act discriminatees already employed in less desirable jobs."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#354">431 U. S. 354</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Our task, then, assuming still that the case properly can be decided on the basis of imputed legislative intent, is "to put to ourselves the question, which choice is it the more likely that Congress would have made," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/280/case.html">Burnet v. Gugenheim,</a></span></em> 288 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 431 U.

S. 285</a></span> (1933) (Cardozo, J.), had it focused on the problem:  would it have validated or invalidated seniority systems that perpetuate pre-Act discrimination?  To answer that question, the devastating impact of today\'s holding validating such systems must be fully understood.  Prior to 1965, blacks and Spanish-surnamed Americans who were able to find employment were assigned the lowest paid, most menial jobs in many industries throughout the Nation, but especially in the South.  In many factories, blacks were hired as laborers while whites were trained and given skilled positions; [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] in the transportation industry blacks could only become porters; [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] and in steel plants blacks were assigned to the coke ovens and blasting furnaces, "the hotter and dirtier" places of employment. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  The Court holds, in essence, that while after 1965 these incumbent employees are entitled to an equal opportunity to advance to more desirable jobs, to take advantage of that opportunity they must pay a price:  they must surrender the seniority they have accumulated in their old jobs.  For many, the price will be too high, and they will be locked into their previous positions. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Even those willing to pay the price will </p><p><a class="page-number" name="388">Page 431 U. S. 388</a></p><p> have to reconcile themselves to being forever behind subsequently hired whites who were not discriminatorily assigned.  Thus equal opportunity will remain a distant dream for all incumbent employees.</p>\n<p>I am aware of nothing in the legislative history of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to suggest that, if Congress had focused on this fact it nonetheless would have decided to write off an entire generation of minority group employees.  Nor can I believe that the Congress that enacted Title VII would have agreed to postpone for one generation the achievement of economic equality.  The backers of that Title viewed economic equality as both a practical necessity and a moral imperative. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  They were well aware of the corrosive impact employment discrimination has on its victims, and on society generally. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  They sought, therefore,</p>\n<p>"to eliminate those discriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially stratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority citizens;"</p>\n<p><em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

S. 389</a></p><p> short, Congress wanted to enable black workers to assume their rightful place in society.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, true that Congress was not willing to invalidate seniority systems on a wholesale basis in pursuit of that goal. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  But the United States, as the plaintiff suing on behalf of the incumbent minority group employees here, does not seek to overturn petitioners\' seniority system.  It seeks only to have the "time actually worked in [minority group] jobs [recognized] as the equal of [the majority group\'s] time," Local 189, <em>United Papermakers  Paperworkers v. United States,</em> 416 F.2d at 995, within the existing seniority system.  Admittedly, such recognition would impinge on the seniority expectations white employees had developed prior to the effective date of the Act.  But in enacting Title VII, Congress manifested a willingness to do precisely that.  For example, the Clark-Case Interpretive Memorandum, <em>see</em> <l=|431 324fn2="" 6|="" u.s.="">n. 6, <em>supra,</em> makes clear that Title VII prohibits unions and employers from using discriminatory waiting lists, developed prior to the effective date of the Title, in making selections for jobs or training programs after that date.  110 Cong Rec. 7213 (1964).  Such a prohibition necessarily would disrupt the expectations of those on the lists.  More generally, the very fact that Congress made Title VII effective shortly after its enactment demonstrates that expectations developed prior to passage of the Act were not considered sacrosanct, since Title VII\'s general ban on employment discrimination inevitably interfered with the preexisting expectations of whites who anticipated benefiting from continued discrimination.  Thus, I am in complete agreement with Judge Butzner\'s conclusion </l=|431></p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 431 U. S. 390</a></p><p> in his seminal decision in <em>Quarles v. Philip Morris,</em> Inc., 279 F.Supp. 505, 516 (ED Va.1968):</p>\n<p>"It is . . . apparent that Congress did not intend to freeze an entire generation of Negro employees into discriminatory patterns that existed before the Act.

The Court all but ignores both developments; I submit they are critical.</p>\n<p>First, in more than a score of decisions beginning at least as early as 1969, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has consistently held that seniority systems that perpetuate prior discrimination are unlawful.

I find no such indications in the Court\'s opinion.\n</em></p>\n<p>Second, in 1972, Congress enacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub.L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103, amending Title VII.  In so doing, Congress made very clear that it approved of the lower court decisions invalidating seniority systems that perpetuate discrimination.  That Congress was aware of such cases is evident from the Senate and House Committee Reports which cite the two leading decisions, as well as several prominent law review articles.  S.Rep. No. 92-415, p. 5 n. 1 (1971); H.R.Rep. No. 92-238, p. 8 n. 2 (1971).  Although Congress took action with respect to other lower court opinions with which it was dissatisfied, [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] it made no attempt to overrule the seniority cases.  To the contrary, both the Senate and House Reports expressed approval of the "perpetuation principle" as applied to seniority systems [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 431 U. S. 392</a></p><p> invoked the principle to justify the Committees\' recommendations to extend Title VII\'s coverage to state and local government employees, [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] and to expand the\' powers of the EEOC. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  Moreover, the Section-by-Section Analysis of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 431 U. S. 393</a></p><p> Conference Committee bill, which was prepared and placed in the Congressional Record by the floor managers of the bill, stated in "language that could hardly be more explicit," <em>Franks v.

And, perhaps most important, in explaining the section of the 1972 Act that empowers the EEOC "to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment practice as set forth in section 2000e-2 or 2000e-3," 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(a) (1970 ed., Supp. V), the Section-by-Section Analysis declared:</p>\n<p>"The unlawful employment practices encompassed by sections 703 and 704 which were enumerated in 1964 by the original Act, <em>and as defined and expanded by the courts,</em> remain in effect."</p>\n<p>118 Cong.Rec. 7167, 7564 (1972) (emphasis added).

Earlier this Term, we implicitly followed this canon in using a statute passed in 1976 to conclude that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 701-706, enacted in 1946, was not intended as an independent grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts. <em> Califano v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/99/case.html">430 U. S. 99</a></span> (1977).  The canon is particularly applicable here for two reasons.  First, because there is no explicit legislative history discussing seniority systems that perpetuate discrimination, we are required to "<em>[seize] every thing from which aid can be derived . . . ,\'" <em>Brown v. GSA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/case.html">425 U. S. 820</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/820/case.html#825">425 U.

Second, because petitioners\' seniority system was readopted in collective bargaining agreements signed after the 1972 Act took effect, any retroactivity problems that ordinarily inhere in using a later Act to interpret an earlier one are not present here.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/87/323/case.html">87 U.

Thus, the Court\'s bald assertion that the intent of the Congress that enacted the 1972 Act is "entitled to little if any weight," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#354">431 U. S. 354</a></span> n. 39, in construing \xc2\xa7 703(h) is contrary to both principle and precedent.\n</em></p>\n<p>Only last Term, we concluded that the legislative materials reviewed above "completely [answer] the argument that Congress somehow intended seniority relief to be less available" than backpay as a remedy for discrimination.  <em>Franks v.

If anything, the materials provide an even more complete answer to the argument that Congress somehow intended to immunize seniority systems that perpetuate past discrimination.  To the extent that today\'s decision grants immunity to such systems, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In stating that the task nonapplicants face in proving that they should be treated like applicants is "difficult," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#364">431 U. S. 364</a></span>, I understand the Court simply to be addressing the facts of this case.  There may well be cases in which the jobs that the nonapplicants seek are so clearly more desirable than their present jobs that proving that, but for the employer\'s discrimination, the nonapplicants previously would have applied will be anything but difficult.</p>\n<p>Even in the present case, however, I believe the Court unnecessarily adds to the nonapplicants\' burden.  While I agree that proof of a nonapplicant\'s current willingness to accept a line driver job is not dispositive of the question of whether the company\'s discrimination deterred the nonapplicant from applying in the past, I do not agree that current willingness "says little," <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/case.html#371">431 U.
