SANDERS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x931209.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 8, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 21, 2009<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs\xe2\x80\x99 (VA) statutory duty to help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75103(a).  VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what further information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type Three, respectively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty to \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  It has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the notice was defective.  The reviewing judge will then decide what \xe2\x80\x9ctype\xe2\x80\x9d of notice error the VA committed.  Under the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, a Type One error has the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect\xe2\x80\x9d of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do not.  In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, <em>e.g.,</em> by describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudication\xe2\x80\x99s essential fairness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, rejected the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach and set forth its own framework for determining whether a notice error is harmless.  When the VA provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in <em>any</em> respect, the framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1) that the defect was cured by the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s actual knowledge or (2) that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law.  The Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondent Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case, the VA denied disability benefits on the ground that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 disability, blindness in his right eye, was not related to his military service.  Sanders argued to the Veterans Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three when it informed him what further information was necessary, but failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary would provide and which portions he would have to provide.  The Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 case after finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was not severe enough to warrant compensation.  Simmons argued to the Veterans Court, <em>inter alia,</em> that the VA had made a Type One notice error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show worsening of her hearing.  The court agreed, finding the error prejudicial.  Noting that a Type One notice error has the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect\xe2\x80\x9d of producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the VA told her more specifically what additional information was needed, she might have obtained that evidence.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error framework conflicts with \xc2\xa77261(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Veterans Court take \xe2\x80\x9cdue account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0That \xc2\xa77261(b)(2) requires the same sort of \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress used the same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Three related features, taken together, demonstrate that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework mandates an approach to harmless error that differs significantly from the one normally taken in civil cases.  First, the framework is too complex and rigid: In every case involving any type of notice error, the Veterans Court <em>must </em>find the error harmful unless the VA demonstrates the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s actual knowledge curing the defect or his ineligibility for benefits as a matter of law.  An error\xe2\x80\x99s harmlessness should not be determined through the use of mandatory presumptions and rigid rules, but through the case-specific application of judgment, based upon examination of the record.  See <em>Kotteakos</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/750/index.html">328 U. S. 750</a>, 760.  Second, the framework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA, requiring the Secretary to demonstrate, <em>e.g.,</em> a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might significantly help the claimant.  Third, the framework requires the VA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.  The burden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Palmer</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/109/index.html">318 U. S. 109</a>, 116.  This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when the underlying matter was criminal.  See, <em>e.g., Kotteakos, supra</em>, at 760.  The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil case.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifications.  First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness of the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effects\xe2\x80\x9d of certain kinds of notice errors.  Second, although Congress\xe2\x80\x99 special solicitude for veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a veteran\xe2\x80\x99s case error that it might consider harmless in other cases, that is not at issue, and need not be decided here.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0In Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case, a review of the record demonstrates that the Veterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless.  The VA\xe2\x80\x99s Types Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sanders has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why he has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.  Sanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence proper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not explained how the notice errors could have made any difference. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 case, some features of the record suggest that the VA\xe2\x80\x99s Type One error was harmless, <em>e.g.,</em> that she has long sought benefits and has a long history of medical examinations.  But other features, <em>e.g.</em>, that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected and has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.  Given the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether reconsideration is necessary.

In both cases the VA erroneously failed to provide the veteran with a certain kind of statutorily required notice. See 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75103(a).  In both cases the VA argued that the error was harmless.  And in both cases the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, after setting forth a framework for determining whether a notice error is harmless, rejected the VA\xe2\x80\x99s argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d framework is too complex and rigid, its presumptions impose unreasonable evidentiary burdens upon the VA, and it is too likely too often to require the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) to treat as harmful errors that in fact are harmless.  We conclude that the framework conflicts with established law.  See \xc2\xa77261(b)(2) (Veterans Court must \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law entitles veterans who have served on active duty in the United States military to receive benefits for disabilities caused or aggravated by their military service.  The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the VA to help a veteran develop his or her benefits claim.  \xc2\xa75103A.  In doing so, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary), upon \xe2\x80\x9creceipt of\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d for benefits, must \xe2\x80\x9cnotify the claimant . . .  of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the Secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  As \xe2\x80\x9cpart of\xe2\x80\x9d the required \xe2\x80\x9cnotice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary must also \xe2\x80\x9cindicate which portion of\xe2\x80\x9d the required \xe2\x80\x9cinformation and evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 is to be provided by the claimant and which portion \xe2\x80\xa6 the Secretary \xe2\x80\xa6 will attempt to obtain.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa75103(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Repeating these statutory requirements in its regulations, the VA has said it will provide a claimant with a letter that tells the claimant (1) what further information is necessary to substantiate his or her claim; (2) what portions of that information the VA will obtain for the claimant; and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.  38 CFR \xc2\xa73.159(b) (2008).  At the time of the decisions below, the regulations also required the VA to tell the claimant (4) that he may submit any other relevant information that he has available.  \xc2\xa73.159(b)(1).  (The VA refers to these notice requirements as Type One, Type Two, Type Three, and Type Four, respectively.)</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The VA\xe2\x80\x99s regional offices decide most claims.  A claimant may appeal an adverse regional office decision to the VA\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Appeals, an administrative board with the power to consider certain types of new evidence.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77107(b), 7109(a); 38 CFR \xc2\xa720.1304(c).  The claimant may seek review of an adverse Board decision in the Veterans Court, an Article I court.  And the claimant (or the Government) may appeal an adverse decision of the Veterans Court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94but only in respect to certain legal matters, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe validity \xe2\x80\xa6 of any statute or regulation \xe2\x80\xa6 or any interpretation thereof \xe2\x80\xa6 that was relied on\xe2\x80\x9d by the Veterans Court in making its decision.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77292.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A specific statute requires the Veterans Court to \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  In applying this statutory provision, the Veterans Court has developed its own special framework for notice errors.  Under this framework, a claimant who argues that the VA failed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the notice was defective.  Then the reviewing judge will decide what \xe2\x80\x9ctype\xe2\x80\x9d of notice error the VA committed.  The Veterans Court has gone on to say that a Type One error (<em>i.e.</em>, a failure to explain what further information is needed) has the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect\xe2\x80\x9d of harming the claimant; but errors of Types Two, Three, or Four (<em>i.e.,</em> a failure to explain just who, claimant or agency, must provide the needed material or to tell the veteran that he may submit any other evidence available) do not have the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect\xe2\x80\x9d of harming the claimant.  In these latter instances, the claimant must show how the error caused harm, for example, by stating in particular just \xe2\x80\x9cwhat evidence\xe2\x80\x9d he would have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining just \xe2\x80\x9chow the lack of that notice and evidence affected the essential fairness of the adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mayfield</em> v. <em>Nicholson</em>, 19 Vet. App. 103, 121 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the first case, Woodrow Sanders, a veteran of World War II, claimed that a bazooka exploded near his face in 1944, causing later blindness in his right eye.  His wartime medical records, however, did not indicate any eye problems.  Indeed, his 1945 discharge examination showed near-perfect vision.  But a 1948 eye examination revealed an inflammation of the right-eye retina and surrounding tissues\xe2\x80\x94a condition that eventually left him nearly blind in that eye.  Soon after the examination Sanders filed a claim for disability benefits.  But in 1949 the VA denied benefits on the ground that Sanders had failed to show a connection between his eye condition and his earlier military service.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Forty-two years later, Sanders asked the VA to reopen his benefits claim.  He argued that the 1944 bazooka explosion had hurt his eye, and added that that he had begun to experience symptoms\xe2\x80\x94blurred vision, swelling, and loss of sight\xe2\x80\x94in 1946.  He included a report from a VA doctor, Dr. Joseph Ruda, who said that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not inconceivable that\xe2\x80\x9d the condition \xe2\x80\x9ccould have occurred secondary to trauma, as stated by\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders.  A private ophthalmologist, Dr. Gregory Strainer, confirming that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 right retina was scarred, added that this \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ype of \xe2\x80\xa6 injury \xe2\x80\xa6 can certainly be concussive in character.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 26a\xe2\x80\x9327a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1992, the VA reopened Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29a. After obtaining Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 military medical records, the VA arranged for a further medical examination, this time by VA eye specialist Dr. Sheila Anderson.  After examining Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 medical history (including records of the examinations made at the time of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 enlistment and discharge), Anderson agreed with the medical diagnosis but concluded that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 condition was not service related.  Since Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 right-eye \xe2\x80\x9cvisual acuity\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9c20/20\xe2\x80\x9d upon enlistment and \xe2\x80\x9c20/25\xe2\x80\x9d upon discharge, and he had \xe2\x80\x9creported decreased vision only 6 months prior\xe2\x80\x9d to his 1948 doctor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvisit,\xe2\x80\x9d and since \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no other signs of ocular trauma,\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson thought that Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 condition \xe2\x80\x9cis most likely infectious in nature, although the etiology at this point is impossible to determine.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cBased on the documented records,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe patient did not lose vision while on active duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  The VA regional office denied Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sanders sought Board review, and in the meantime he obtained the opinion of another VA doctor, Dr. Duane Nii, who said that the \xe2\x80\x9cetiology of the patient\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d eye condition \xe2\x80\x9cis . . . difficult to ascertain.\xe2\x80\x9d  He thought that \xe2\x80\x9cit is possible that\xe2\x80\x9d the condition \xe2\x80\x9ccould be related to\xe2\x80\x9d a bazooka explosion, though the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility of\xe2\x80\x9d an infection \xe2\x80\x9cas the etiology \xe2\x80\xa6 could also be entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 30a.  The Board concluded that Sanders had failed to show that the eye injury was service connected.  The Board said that it had relied most heavily upon Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s report because, unlike other reports, it took account of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 military medical records documenting his eyesight at the time of his enlistment and discharge.  And the Board consequently affirmed the regional office\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sanders then appealed to the Veterans Court.  There he argued, among other things, that the VA had made a notice error.  Sanders conceded that the VA had sent him a letter telling him (1) what further information was necessary to substantiate his claim.  But, he said, the VA letter did not tell him (2) which <em>portions </em>of the information the Secretary would provide or (3) which <em>portions</em> he would have to provide.  That is to say, he complained about notice errors Type Two and Type Three.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Veterans Court held that these notice errors were harmless.  It said that Sanders had not explained how he would have acted differently, say, by identifying what different evidence he would have produced or asked the Secretary to obtain for him, had he received proper notice. Finding no other error, the Veterans Court affirmed the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision and held that the Veterans Court was wrong to find the notice error harmless.  The Federal Circuit wrote that when the VA provides a claimant with a notice letter that is deficient in <em>any</em> respect (to the point where a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable person\xe2\x80\x9d would not have read it as providing the necessary information), the Veterans Court \xe2\x80\x9cshould \xe2\x80\xa6 presum[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that the notice error is \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial, requiring reversal unless the VA can show that the error did not affect the essential fairness of the adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sanders</em> v. <em>Nicholson</em>, 487 F.\xc2\xa03d 881, 889 (2007).  To make this latter showing, the court added, the VA must \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate\xe2\x80\x9d (1) that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefect was cured by actual knowledge on the\xe2\x80\x9d claimant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpart,\xe2\x80\x9d or (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthat a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the VA had not made such a showing, the Federal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the second case before us, the claimant, Patricia Simmons, served on active military duty from December 1978 to April 1980.  While on duty she worked in a noisy environment close to aircraft; after three months she began to lose hearing in her left ear; and by the time she was discharged, her left-ear hearing had become worse.  Soon after her discharge, Simmons applied for disability benefits.  The VA regional office found her hearing loss was service connected; but it also found the loss insufficiently severe to warrant compensation.  In November 1980, it denied her claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998, Simmons asked the VA to reopen her claim.  She provided medical examination records showing further loss of hearing in her left ear along with (what she considered related) loss of hearing in her right ear.  The VA arranged for hearing examinations by VA doctors in 1999, 2001, and 2002.  The doctors measured her left-ear hearing loss, ranking it as moderate to severe; they also measured her right-ear hearing loss, ranking it as mild to moderate.  After comparing the results of the examinations with a VA hearing-loss compensation schedule, the regional office concluded that Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was not severe enough to warrant compensation.  At the same time, the regional office concluded that her right-ear hearing loss was neither service connected nor sufficiently severe.  Simmons appealed the decision to the Board, which affirmed the regional office\xe2\x80\x99s determination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, Simmons appealed to the Veterans Court.  Among other things, she said that she had not received a notice about (and she consequently failed to attend) a further right-ear medical examination that the VA later told her it had arranged.  She added that, in respect to her claim for benefits for loss of hearing in her left ear, the VA had made a Type One notice error (<em>i.e.</em>, it had failed to tell her what further information was needed to substantiate her claim).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Simmons conceded that she had received a letter from the VA.  But the letter told her only what, in general, a person had to do to show that a hearing injury was service connected.  It did not tell her anything about her specific problem, namely, what further information she must provide to show a worsening of hearing in her left ear, to the point where she could receive benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Veterans Court agreed with Simmons, and it found both errors prejudicial.  In respect to Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 left-ear hearing loss (the matter at issue here), it pointed out that it had earlier said (in <em>Mayfield</em>, 19 Vet. App., at 120\xe2\x80\x93124)<em> </em>that a Type One notice error has the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect of producing prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court added that its \xe2\x80\x9crevie[w] [of] the record in its entirety\xe2\x80\x9d convinced it that Simmons did not have \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge of what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim\xe2\x80\x9d and, had the VA told Simmons more specifically about what additional medical information it needed, Simmons might have \xe2\x80\x9cobtained\xe2\x80\x9d a further \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d medical \xe2\x80\x9cexamination substantiating her claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. G to Pet. for Cert. 81a.  The Veterans Court consequently remanded the case to the Board.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government appealed the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  And that court affirmed the Veterans Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the basis of its decision in <em>Sanders.  Simmons</em> v.<em> Nicholson,</em> 487 F.\xc2\xa03d 892 (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">F</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in both Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 and Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 cases in order to determine the lawfulness of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d holdings. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holdings flow directly from its use of the \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d framework that we have described.  <em>Supra</em>,<em> </em>at 6.  Thus we must decide whether that framework is consistent with a particular statutory requirement, namely, the requirement that the Veterans Court \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error,\xe2\x80\x9d\n38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  See <em>supra,</em> at 3<em>.</em>  We conclude\nthat the framework is not consistent with the statutory demand.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that the statute, in stating that the Veterans Court must \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error,\xe2\x80\x9d requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind of \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d rule that courts ordinarily apply in civil cases.  The statutory words \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d make clear that is so.  Congress used the same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] court shall review the whole record \xe2\x80\xa6 and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act explained that the APA\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d is intended to \xe2\x80\x9csu[m] up in succinct fashion the \xe2\x80\x98harmless error\xe2\x80\x99 rule applied by the courts <em>in the review of lower court decisions as well as of administrative bodies.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 110 (1947) (emphasis added).  And we have previously described \xc2\xa7706 as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98administrative law \xe2\x80\xa6 harmless error rule.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Assn. of Home Builders</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/644/index.html">551 U. S. 644</a>, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (quoting <em>PDK Labs. Inc.</em> v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F.\xc2\xa03d 786, 799 (CADC 2004)).  Legislative history confirms that Congress intended the Veterans Court \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial error\xe2\x80\x9d statute to \xe2\x80\x9cincorporate a reference\xe2\x80\x9d to the APA\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 100\xe2\x80\x93418, p. 61 (1988).  We have no indication of any relevant distinction between the manner in which reviewing courts treat civil and administrative cases.  Consequently, we assess the lawfulness of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach in light of our general case law governing application of the harmless-error standard.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three related features of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework, taken together, convince us that it mandates an approach to harmless error that differs significantly from the approach courts normally take in ordinary civil cases.  First, the framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory.  In every case involving a notice error (of no matter which kind) the Veterans Court <em>must </em>find the error harmful unless the VA \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d (1) that the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d cured the defect or (2) that the claimant could not have received a benefit as a matter of law.  Suppose the notice error, as in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case, consisted of a failure to describe what additional information, if any, the VA would provide.  It might be obvious from the record in the particular case that the error made no difference.  But under the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule, the Veterans Court would have to remand the case for new proceedings\nregardless.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously warned against courts\xe2\x80\x99 determining whether an error is harmless through the use of mandatory presumptions and rigid rules rather than case-specific application of judgment, based upon examination of the record.  See <em>Kotteakos</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/750/index.html">328 U. S. 750</a>, 760 (1946).  The federal \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d statute, now codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72111, tells courts to review cases for errors of law \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to errors\xe2\x80\x9d that do not affect the parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  That language seeks to prevent appellate courts from becoming \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0impregnable citadels of technicality,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kotteakos</em>, 328 U. S., at 759.  And we have read it as expressing a congressional preference for determining \xe2\x80\x9charmless error\xe2\x80\x9d without the use of presumptions insofar as those presumptions may lead courts to find an error harmful, when, in fact, in the particular case before the court, it is not.  See<em> id.</em>, at 760;<em> O\xe2\x80\x99Neal</em> v. <em>McAninch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/432/index.html">513 U. S. 432</a>, 436\xe2\x80\x93437 (1995); see also R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 26 (1970) (hereinafter Traynor) (reviewing court normally should \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine whether the error affected the judgment . . . without benefit of such aids as presumptions \xe2\x80\xa6 that expedite fact-finding at trial\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s presumptions exhibit the very characteristics that Congress sought to discourage.  In the cases before us, they would prevent the reviewing court from directly asking the harmless-error question.  They would prevent that court from resting its conclusion on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  And they would require the reviewing court to<em> </em>find the notice error prejudicial even if that court, having read the entire record, conscientiously concludes the contrary.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA.  How is the Secretary to demonstrate, in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case for example, that Sanders <em>knew </em>that he, not the VA, would have to produce more convincing evidence that the bazooka accident caused his eye injury?  How could the Secretary demonstrate that there is <em>no </em>evidence anywhere that would entitle Sanders to benefits?  To show a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind about such a matter will often prove difficult, perhaps impossible.  And even if the VA (as in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case) searches the military records and comes up emptyhanded, it may still prove difficult, or impossible, to prove the nonexistence of evidence lying somewhere about that might significantly help the claimant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously pointed out that setting an evidentiary \xe2\x80\x9cbarrier so high that it could never be surmounted would justify the very criticism that spawned the harmless-error doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, reversing for error \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98regardless of its effect on the judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1999) (quoting Traynor 50).  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary rules increase the likelihood of reversal in cases where, in fact, the error is harmless.  And, as we pointed out in <em>Neder, </em>that likelihood encourages abuse of the judicial process and diminishes the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in the fair and effective operation of the judicial system.  527 U. S., at 18.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s framework requires the VA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.  This Court has said that the party that \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to have a judgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries the burden of showing that prejudice resulted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Palmer</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/109/index.html">318 U. S. 109</a>, 116 (1943); see also <em>Tipton</em> v. <em>Socony Mobil Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/34/index.html">375 U. S. 34</a>, 36 (1963) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Borden Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/514/index.html">347 U. S. 514</a>, 516\xe2\x80\x93517 (1954); cf.<em> McDonough Power Equipment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Greenwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/548/index.html">464 U. S. 548</a>, 553 (1984); <em>Market Street R. Co.</em> v. <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/324/548/index.html">324 U. S. 548</a>, 562 (1945) (finding error harmless \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of any showing of \xe2\x80\xa6 prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lower court cases make clear that courts have correlated review of ordinary administrative proceedings to appellate review of civil cases in this respect.  Consequently, the burden of showing that an error is harmful normally falls upon the party attacking the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>American Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Transp.</em>, 202 F.\xc2\xa03d 788, 797 (CA5 2000) (declining to remand where appellant failed to show that error in administrative proceeding was harmful); <em>Air Canada</em> v. <em>Department of Transp.</em>, 148 F.\xc2\xa03d 1142, 1156\xe2\x80\x931157 (CADC 1998) (same); <em>Nelson</em> v. <em>Apfel</em>, 131 F.\xc2\xa03d 1228, 1236 (CA7 1997) (same); <em>Bar MK Ranches</em> v. <em>Yuetter</em>, 994 F.\xc2\xa02d 735, 740 (CA10 1993) (same);<em> Camden</em> v. <em>Department of Labor</em>, 831 F.\xc2\xa02d 449, 451 (CA3 1987) (same); <em>Panhandle Co-op Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 771 F.\xc2\xa02d 1149, 1153 (CA8 1985) (same); <em>Frankfort</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 678 F.\xc2\xa02d 699, 708 (CA7 1982) (same); <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Seine &amp; Line Fishermen</em>, 374 F.\xc2\xa02d 974, 981 (CA9 1967) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To say that the claimant has the \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d of showing that an error was harmful is not to impose a complex system of \xe2\x80\x9cburden shifting\xe2\x80\x9d rules or a particularly onerous requirement.  In ordinary civil appeals, for example, the appellant will point to rulings by the trial judge that the appellant claims are erroneous, say, a ruling excluding favorable evidence.  Often the circumstances of the case will make clear to the appellate judge that the ruling, if erroneous, was harmful and nothing further need be said.  But, if not, then the party seeking reversal normally must explain why the erroneous ruling caused harm.  If, for example, the party seeking an affirmance makes a strong argument that the evidence on the point was overwhelming regardless, it normally makes sense to ask the party seeking reversal to provide an explanation, say, by marshaling the facts and evidence showing the contrary.  The party seeking to reverse the result of a civil proceeding will likely be in a position at least as good as, and often better than, the opposing party to explain how he has been hurt by an error.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fior D\xe2\x80\x99Italia, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/238/index.html">536 U. S. 238</a>, 256, n.\xc2\xa04 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents urge the creation of a special rule for this context, placing upon the agency the burden of proving that a notice error did <em>not</em> cause harm.  But we have placed such a burden on the appellee only when the matter underlying review was criminal.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kotteakos</em>, 328 U. S., at 760.  In criminal cases the Government seeks to deprive an individual of his liberty, thereby providing a good reason to require the Government to explain why an error should not upset the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  And the fact that the Government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt justifies a rule that makes it more difficult for the reviewing court to find that an error did not affect the outcome of a case.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a>, 741 (1993) (stating that the Government bears the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of showing the absence of prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d).  But in the ordinary civil case that is not so.  See <em>Palmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 116.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our discussion above is subject to two important qualifications.  First, we need not, and we do not, decide the lawfulness of the use by the Veterans Court of what it called the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effects\xe2\x80\x9d of certain kinds of notice errors.  We have previously made clear that courts may sometimes make empirically based generalizations about what kinds of errors are likely, as a factual matter, to prove harmful.  See <em>Kotteakos</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 760\xe2\x80\x93761 (reviewing courts may learn over time that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98natural effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of certain errors is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to prejudice a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess., p.\xc2\xa01 (1919))).  And by drawing upon \xe2\x80\x9cexperience\xe2\x80\x9d that reveals some such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98natural effect,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a court might properly influence, though not control, future determinations.  See <em>Kotteakos</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 760\xe2\x80\x93761<em>.</em>  We consider here, however, only the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error framework.  That framework, as we have said, is mandatory.  And its presumptions are not based upon an effort to determine \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the Federal Circuit is the wrong court to make such determinations.  Statutes limit the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s review to certain kinds of Veterans Court errors, namely, those that concern \xe2\x80\x9cthe validity of \xe2\x80\xa6 any statute or regulation \xe2\x80\xa6 or any interpretation thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77292.  But the factors that inform a reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9charmless-error\xe2\x80\x9d determination are various, potentially involving, among other case-specific factors, an estimation<em> </em>of the likelihood that the result would have been different, an awareness of what body (jury, lower court, administrative agency) has the authority to reach that result, a consideration of the error\xe2\x80\x99s likely effects on the perceived fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, and a hesitancy to generalize too broadly about particular kinds of errors when the specific factual circumstances in which the error arises may well make all the difference.  See <em>Neder</em>, 527 U. S., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319; <em>Kotteakos</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 761\xe2\x80\x93763; Traynor 33\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is the Veterans Court, not the Federal Circuit, that sees sufficient case-specific raw material in veterans\xe2\x80\x99 cases to enable it to make empirically based, nonbinding generalizations about \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the Veterans Court, which has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, is likely better able than is the Federal Circuit to exercise an informed judgment as to how often veterans are harmed by which kinds of notice errors.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Haggar Apparel Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/380/index.html">526 U. S. 380</a>, 394 (1999) (Article I court\xe2\x80\x99s special \xe2\x80\x9cexpertise \xe2\x80\xa6 guides it in making complex determinations in a specialized area of the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we recognize that Congress has expressed special solicitude for the veterans\xe2\x80\x99 cause.  See <em>post</em>, at 2 (Souter, J., dissenting).  A veteran, after all, has performed an especially important service for the Nation, often at the risk of his or her own life.  And Congress has made clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency.  Rather, the VA has a statutory duty to help the veteran develop his or her benefits claim.  See Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75103A.  Moreover, the adjudicatory process is not truly adversarial, and the veteran is often unrepresented during the claims proceedings.  See <em>Walters</em> v. <em>National Assn. of Radiation Survivors</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/305/index.html">473 U. S. 305</a>, 311 (1985).  These facts might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a veteran\xe2\x80\x99s case error that it might consider harmless in other circumstances.  But that is not the question before us.  And we need not here decide whether, or to what extent, that may be so. </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have considered the two cases before us in light of the principles discussed.  In Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case, the Veterans Court found the notice error harmless.  And after reviewing the record, we conclude that finding is lawful.  The VA told Sanders what further evidence would be needed to substantiate his claim.  It failed to specify what portion of any additional evidence the Secretary would provide (we imagine none) and what portion Sanders would have to provide (we imagine all).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How could the VA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to specify this (or any other) division of labor have mattered?  Sanders has pursued his claim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical examinations; and he should be aware of the respect in which his benefits claim is deficient (namely, his inability to show that his disability is connected to his World War II service).  See <em>supra</em>, at 5<em>. </em> Sanders has not told the Veterans Court, the Federal Circuit, or this Court, what specific additional evidence proper notice would have led him to obtain or seek.  He has not explained to the Veterans Court, to the Federal Circuit, or to us, how the notice error to which he points could have made any difference.  The Veterans Court did not consider the harmlessness issue a borderline question.  Nor do we.  We consequently reverse the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case so that the court can reinstate the judgment of the Veterans Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 case is more difficult.  The Veterans Court found that the VA had committed a Type One error, <em>i.e.</em>, a failure to tell Simmons what information or evidence she must provide to substantiate her claim.  The VA sent Simmons a letter that provided her only with general information about how to prove a claim while telling her nothing at all about how to proceed further in her own case, a case in which the question was whether a concededly service-connected left-ear hearing problem had deteriorated to the point where it was compensable.  And the VA did so in the context of having arranged for a further right-ear medical examination, which (because of lack of notice) Simmons failed to attend.  The Veterans Court took the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural effect\xe2\x80\x9d of a Type One error into account while also reviewing the record as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some features of the record suggest the error was harmless, for example, the fact that Simmons has long sought benefits and has a long history of medical examinations.  But other features\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, the fact that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected and has continuously deteriorated over time, and the fact that the VA had scheduled a further examination of her right ear that (had notice been given) might have revealed further left-ear hearing loss\xe2\x80\x94suggest the opposite.  Given the uncertainties, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case so that the Veterans Court can decide whether re-consideration is necessary.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s harmless-error framework is inconsistent with the statutory requirement that the Veterans Court take \xe2\x80\x9cdue account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  We reverse the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 case, and we vacate its judgment in Simmons\xe2\x80\x99 case.

SIMMONS</p>\n<p align="left">on writs of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[April 21, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law requires the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  Under this provision, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) fails to notify a veteran of the information needed to support his benefit claim, as required by 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75103(a), must the veteran prove the error harmful, or must the VA prove its error harmless?  The Federal Circuit held that the VA should bear the burden.  <em>Sanders</em> v. <em>Nicholson</em>, 487 F.\xc2\xa03d 881 (2007).  The Court reverses because the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach is \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex, rigid, and mandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9, \xe2\x80\x9cimposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and contradicts the rule in other civil and administrative cases by \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] the VA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11.  I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking the last point first, the Court assumes that there is a standard allocation of the burden of proving harmlessness that Congress meant to adopt in directing the Veterans Court to \xe2\x80\x9ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\xe2\x80\x9d  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  But as both the majority and the Government concede, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Keyes</em> v. <em>School Dist. No. 1, Denver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/189/index.html">413 U. S. 189</a>, 209 (1973), and courts impose the burden of dealing with harmlessness differently in different circumstances.  As the Court says, the burden is on the Government in criminal cases, <em>ante</em>, at 13, and even in civil and administrative appeals courts sometimes require the party getting the benefit of the error to show its harmlessness, depending on the statutory setting or specific sort of mistake made, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McLouth Steel Prods. Corp.</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 838 F.\xc2\xa02d 1317, 1324 (CADC 1988) (declaring that imposing the burden of proving harm \xe2\x80\x9con the challenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has completely failed to comply with\xe2\x80\x9d notice and comment procedures).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the question is whether placing the burden of persuasion on the veteran is in order under the statutory scheme governing the VA.  I believe it is not.  The VA differs from virtually every other agency in being itself obliged to help the claimant develop his claim, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75103A, and a number of other provisions and practices of the VA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative and judicial review process reflect a congressional policy to favor the veteran, see, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa75107(b) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant\xe2\x80\x9d whenever \xe2\x80\x9cthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa77252(a) (allowing the veteran, but not the Secretary, to appeal an adverse decision to the Veterans Court).  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99s understandable decision to place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions, I would not remove a comparable benefit in the Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Court based on the ambiguous directive of \xc2\xa77261(b)(2).  And even if there were a question in my mind, I would come out the same way under our longstanding \xe2\x80\x9crule that interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U. S. 115</a>, 118 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments are open to judgment, but I do not see that placing the burden of showing harm on the VA goes so far as to create a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex, rigid, and mandatory\xe2\x80\x9d scheme, <em>ante</em>, at 9, or to impose \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Under the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule, the VA simply \xe2\x80\x9cmust persuade the reviewing court that the purpose of the notice was not frustrated, e.g., by demonstrating: (1) that any defect was cured by actual knowledge on the part of the claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be expected to understand from the notice what was needed, or (3) that a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sanders</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 889.  This gives the VA several ways to show that an error was harmless, and the VA has been able to shoulder the burden in a number of cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Peake</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x930852, 2008 WL 974728, *2 (Vet. App., Apr. 3, 2008) (Table) (finding notice error harmless because the claimant had \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge of what was required to substantiate\xe2\x80\x9d his claim); <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Peake</em>, No. 05\xe2\x80\x932422, 2008 WL 852588, *4 (Vet. App., Mar. 24, 2008) (Table) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule thus strikes me as workable and in keeping with the statutory scheme governing veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits.  It has the added virtue of giving the VA a strong incentive to comply with its notice obligations, obligations \xe2\x80\x9cthat g[o] to the very essence of the nonadversarial, pro-claimant nature of the VA adjudication system \xe2\x80\xa6 by affording a claimant a meaningful opportunity to participate effectively in the processing of his or her claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mayfield</em> v. <em>Nicholson</em>, 19 Vet. App. 103, 120\xe2\x80\x93121 (2005).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would affirm the Federal Circuit and respectfully dissent. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
