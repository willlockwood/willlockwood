CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The parties to this case are the same transit workers, the same transit company, and the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board before the Court in No. 329, decided this day, <em>ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html">340 U. S. 383</a></span>.  This action arises out of the same threatened strike discussed in that case.  After a restraining order had led to postponement of the strike, the Wisconsin Board appointed arbitrators to "hear and determine" the dispute in accordance with the terms of the Wisconsin Public Utility Anti-Strike Law.  Wis.Stat. 1947, \xc2\xa7 111.55.  Upon the filing of the arbitrators\' award, petitioners filed an action in a state circuit court to review that award.  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xa7 111.60.  That court affirmed the award and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, 1950, 257 Wis. 53, 42 N.W.2d 477.  We granted certiorari in this case, together with No. 329, 340 U.S. 874 (1950).</p>\n<p>In the courts below and in this Court, petitioners attack the arbitration award on the same grounds urged against the Wisconsin Act as a whole in No. 329, and, in addition, raise issues peculiar to the arbitration phase of that act.  But we do not reach these issues, since it is clear that this case has become moot. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/416/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 340 U. S. 418</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The arbitration award became effective on April 11, 1949.  Under the Wisconsin Act, that award "shall continue effective for one year from that date," unless sooner terminated by agreement of the parties.  Wis.Stat. 1949, \xc2\xa7 111.59.  We are informed that this award was superseded by agreement, and, in any event, the one-year period has elapsed.  There being no subject matter upon which the judgment of this Court can operate, the cause is moot.</p>\n<p>It is argued that the Wisconsin courts have adopted a practice of deciding questions of importance even though the case has become moot, and we are urged to follow that same practice.  But whatever the practice in Wisconsin courts,</p>\n<p>"A federal court is without power to decide moot questions or to give advisory opinions which cannot affect the rights of the litigants in the case before it.  <em>United States v.

The injunction before us in No. 329 is "perpetual" by its terms, so that the action does not become moot even though the decree be obeyed.  <em>J. I. Case Co. v.
