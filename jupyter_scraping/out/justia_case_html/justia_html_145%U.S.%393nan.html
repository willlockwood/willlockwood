The bill, as originally framed, prayed for a cancellation and surrender of the lease, for a return of the railroad and other property held under it, for an injunction against disturbing the plaintiff in the possession and control thereof, and for an account of the sums which the defendant had received from the use and operation of the railroad and property, or if the lease should be held valid, for an account of the sums due under the lease, and for further relief.</p>\n<p>The defendant demurred to the bill for want of equity, for laches, for multifariousness, and because the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law.  The circuit court sustained the demurrer on all these grounds, as stated in its opinion, reported in 33 F. 440.  The plaintiff thereupon, by leave of court, amended the bill by striking out the prayer for alternative relief in case the lease should be held valid.  The defendant demurred to the amended bill, on the same grounds as before, except multifariousness.  The court, delivering no further opinion, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, and the plaintiff appealed to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 145 U.

S. 400</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The object of this suit between two railroad corporations, as stated in the amended bill, is to have a contract, by which the plaintiff transferred its railroad and equipment, as well as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 145 U. S. 401</a></p><p> its franchise to maintain and operate the road, to the defendant for a term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, set aside and cancelled, as beyond the corporate powers of one or both of the parties.</p>\n<p>The contract, dated February 10, 1868, recites that the plaintiff is a corporation of Illinois, and the defendant a corporation of Indiana; that their railroads connect at the line between the two states; that it is desirable that the two roads should be operated by the defendant as one road, and that the defendant has "proposed to lease and operate" the plaintiff\'s road for a period of nine hundred and ninety-nine years.  "It is therefore agreed" that, upon the completion of the plaintiff\'s road to the state line, the defendant "shall take charge of and operate the same with its equipment" for that period, and</p>\n<p>"shall be allowed sixty-five percent of the gross receipts from all traffic moved over the line, or business done thereon, and from the property of the company as a consideration for working and maintenance expenses,"</p>\n<p>and shall appropriate the rest of such receipts to the payment of interest on the plaintiff\'s mortgage bonds, and pay any surplus to the plaintiff, for the benefit of its stockholders.  Within a year afterwards, the contract was modified by providing that the defendant should be allowed seventy, instead of sixty-five, percent of the gross receipts,</p>\n<p>"but if the working and maintenance expenses of said road shall be less than seventy percent of the gross receipts aforesaid, then all of such excess shall be paid over to the"</p>\n<p>plaintiff.  It is further agreed in the contract that the defendant "shall enjoy all the rights, powers, and privileges of the" plaintiff "so far as the same may be needful to maintain and operate said railroad," and may "impose and collect tolls and rates for transportation, and do all other acts and things, as fully and as effectually as the" plaintiff "could do if operating said line."</p>\n<p>In short, by this contract, one railroad corporation undertook to transfer its whole railroad and equipment, and its privilege and franchise to maintain and operate the road to another railroad corporation for a term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years in consideration of the payment from time </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 145 U. S. 402</a></p><p> to time by the latter to the former of a certain portion of the gross receipts.  This was, in substance and effect, a lease of the railroad and franchise for a term of almost a thousand years, and was a contract which neither corporation had the lawful power to enter into unless expressly authorized by the state which created it, and which, if beyond the scope of the lawful powers of either corporation, was unlawful and wholly void, could not be ratified or validated by either or both, and would support no action or suit by either against the other.  <em>Thomas v.

St. Louis, Alton &amp; Terre Haute Railroad,</em> above cited.</p>\n<p>By the statute of Illinois of February 12, 1855, all railroad companies incorporated under the laws of the state were empowered to make "contracts and arrangements with each other, and with railroad corporations of other states, for leasing or running their roads, or any part thereof."  Private Laws of 1855, p. 304; Rev.Stat. of 1874, c. 114, \xc2\xa7 34.  By the grammatical and the natural construction, the words "their roads" include roads of Illinois corporations as well as roads of corporations of other states, and the power conferred on corporations of Illinois to make contracts "for leasing" such roads includes making, as well as taking, leases thereof.  Such was the opinion expressed in the case just cited, at page  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/290/case.html#309">118 U. S. 309</a></span>, and we see no reason for departing from it.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff relies on the statute of Illinois of February 16, 1865 (in force at the date of this contract, but since repealed by the Revised Statutes of 1874), by which it was enacted that</p>\n<p>"it shall not be lawful for any railroad company of Illinois or for the directors of any railroad company of Illinois to consolidate their road with any railroad out of the State of Illinois, or to lease their road to any railroad company </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 145 U. S. 403</a></p><p> out of the State of Illinois, or to lease any railroad out of the State of Illinois without having first obtained the written consent of all of the stockholders of said roads residing in the State of Illinois, and any contract for such consolidation or lease which may be made without having first obtained said written consent, signed by the resident stockholders in Illinois, shall be null and void,"</p>\n<p>and it was provided "that nothing in this act shall be so construed as to authorize the consolidation of any of said railroads with railroads out of the State of Illinois."  Illinois Public Laws of 1865, p. 102.</p>\n<p>Although this statute in terms declares that any such lease made without the written consent of the Illinois stockholders "shall be null and void," it would seem to have been enacted for the protection of such stockholders alone, and intended to be availed of by them only.  It did not limit the scope of the powers conferred upon the corporation by law, an excess of which could not be ratified or be made good by estoppel, but only prescribed regulations as to the manner of exercising corporate powers, compliance with which the stockholders might waive or the corporation might be estopped, by lapse of time, or otherwise, to deny.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/64/381/case.html">Zabriskie v.

Terre Haute &amp; Indianapolis Railroad,</em> 102 Ill. 493, cited by each party at the argument, does not appear to have any important bearing upon this case.  The point there decided was that the contract now in question, not being satisfactorily proved in that case to have been either assented to or ratified by the stockholders residing in Illinois, had no effect as a lease to convey title to the defendant, and could be sustained, if at all, only as a contract for the connection of the two railroads, and in either aspect did not confer on the defendant any right to maintain a bill in equity against collectors of taxes to restrain the collection of taxes assessed to the present plaintiff.  Upon questions discussed in the opinion and not necessary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 145 U. S. 404</a></p><p> to the judgment or not considered at all, the case cannot be regarded as a decision, because, as observed by Mr. Justice Curtis, speaking for this Court,</p>\n<p>"to make it so, there must have been an application of the judicial mind to the precise question necessary to be determined to fix the rights of the parties."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/275/case.html">Carroll v.

St. Louis, Alton &amp; Terre Haute Railroad,</em> above cited, which was much considered both upon argument at the bar and upon petition for a rehearing.  The only differences between that case and this are that the contract in that case was for ninety-nine years, whereas in this it is for nine hundred years more, that the rent is computed in a different way, which does not alter the nature and effect of the transaction, and that in that case the two roads did not connect at the state line, but a few miles east of it, which was held to be immaterial.  118 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/286/case.html#295">119 U.

S. 312</a></span>.   But in that opinion, reference was made to <em>Tippecance Commissioners v. Lafayette &amp;c. Railroad,</em> in which the Supreme Court of Indiana held that this statute did not authorize one railroad corporation to lease its railroad to another with a right of perpetual renewal, and said "[t]o connect one road with another does not fairly mean to lease or sell it to another."  50 Ind. 85, 110; 118 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/290/case.html#312">118 U. S. 312</a></span>.  And upon the petition for rehearing, all three sections of the statute in question, as well as other statutes of Indiana, were cited by counsel and examined by the court, although its conclusions were briefly stated, according to its usage in an opinion delivered on a petition for rehearing.  118 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/631/case.html#633">119 U. S. 633</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is argued for the defendant that this suit is distinguished from the former one in being brought not, as that was, in Indiana, but in Illinois, and must therefore be controlled by the law and policy of Illinois, and it is contended that the statute of Illinois of 1855, above cited, empowered the defendant, though an Indiana corporation, to take a lease of a railroad in Illinois.  But such a suit as this is governed, so far as regards the validity of the contract, not by the law of the forum, but by the law of the contract, and the statute of Illinois was manifestly intended to confer power on domestic corporations only, leaving the powers of corporations incorporated elsewhere to be determined by the laws by and under which they were incorporated, even if a state could confer on a foreign corporation powers which it did not have by the laws of its own state.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/527/case.html">Canada Southern Railway v.

If it can, it is somewhat remarkable that, in the repeated and full discussions which the doctrine of <em>ultra vires</em> has undergone in the English courts within the last fifty years, no attempt has been made to bring a suit like this.  The only cases cited in the elaborate briefs for the plaintiff or which have come to our notice approaching this in their circumstances are in American courts not of last resort, and present no sufficient reasons for maintaining this suit.  <em>Auburn Academy v. Strong,</em> Hopkins Ch. 278; <em>Atlantic &amp; Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Union Pacific Railway,</em> 1 F. 745; <em>Western union Telegraph Co. v.

Bruning,</em> 2 Vernon 392, <em>s.c., nom. Goldsmith v. Bruning,</em> 1 Eq.Cas.Abr. 89, or to recover back money paid for the purchase, without leave of the crown, of a commission in the military or naval service, as in <em>Morris v. McCullock,</em> Ambier 433, <em>s.c.,</em> 2 Eden, 190.  Those cases have sometimes been justified upon the ground that, the agreement being against the policy of the law, the relief was given to the public through the party.  <em>Debenham v. Ox,</em> 1 Ves. Sr. 276; <em>St. John v. St. John,</em> 11 Ves. 526, 536; <em>Cone v. Russell,</em> 48 N.J.Eq. 208.

Thomson,</em> 7 Ves. 470, or with the current of later authorities.</p>\n<p>The general rule, in equity, as at law, is <em>in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis,</em> and therefore neither party to an illegal contract will be aided by the court, whether to enforce it or to set it aside.  If the contract is illegal, affirmative relief against it will not be granted at law or in equity unless the contract remains executory or unless the parties are considered not in equal fault, as where the law violated is intended for the coercion of the one party and the protection of the other, or where there has been fraud or oppression on the part of the defendant.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/79/349/case.html">Thomas v.

Adams on Eq. 175.  Consequently it is well settled at the present day that a court of equity will not entertain jurisdiction to order an instrument to be delivered up and cancelled upon the ground of illegality appearing on its face, and when, therefore, there is no danger that the lapse of time may deprive the party to be charged upon it of his means of defense.

Richmond,</em> above cited; <em>Ayerst v. Jenkins,</em> L.R. 16 Eq. 275, 284.

The plaintiff stood in the position of alienating the powers which it had received from the state, and the duties which it owed to the public, to another corporation which it knew had no lawful capacity to exercise those powers or to perform those duties.  If, as the plaintiff contends, the contract was also beyond its own corporate powers, it is certainly in no better position.  In either aspect of the case, the plaintiff was <em>in pari delicto</em> with the defendant.  The invalidity of the contract, in view of the laws of which both parties were bound to take notice, was apparent on its face.  The contract has been fully executed on the part of the plaintiff by the actual transfer of its railroad and franchise to the defendant, and the defendant has held the property, and paid the stipulated consideration, from time to time, for seventeen years, and has taken no steps to rescind or repudiate the contract.</p>\n<p>Upon this state of facts, for the reasons above stated, the plaintiff, considered as a party to the unlawful contract, has no right to invoke the assistance of a court of equity to set it aside.  And so far as the plaintiff corporation can be considered as representing the stockholders, and seeking to protect their interests, it and they are barred by laches.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/84/78/case.html">Harwood v.
