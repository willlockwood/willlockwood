So far as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 149 U. S. 263</a></p><p> disclosed by the record, the bill of exceptions was not tendered to the judge, or signed by him, until October 7, 1889, and no order was entered extending the time for its presentation, nor was there any consent of parties thereto, nor any standing rule of court which authorized such approval.  The bill of exceptions was therefore improvidently allowed.  <em>Muller v. Ehlers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/249/case.html">91 U. S. 249</a></span>; <em>Jones v.
