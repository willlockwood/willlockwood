THOMAS<br/>\n547 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ALBERTO R. GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL <em>v.</em> MICHELLE THOMAS et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x93552.\xe2\x80\x83Decided April 17, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General to grant an alien asylum if the alien cannot return to another country because of \xe2\x80\x9cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, <em>membership in a particular social group,</em> or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101(a)(42)(A), as added, \xc2\xa7201, 94 Stat. 102, 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added).  The respondents, Michelle Thomas and her immediate family, applied for asylum.  They checked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim rested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa because of (1) their \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical opinion[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) their \xe2\x80\x9cmembership in a particular social group.\xe2\x80\x9d  In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution because of their race (they are white) and their kinship with Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s father-in-law, \xe2\x80\x9cBoss Ronnie,\xe2\x80\x9d a white South African who allegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the company at which he was a foreman.  The Immigration Judge, focusing upon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim.  And the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the Thomases\xe2\x80\x99 primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote that the Board had not adequately considered the Thomases\xe2\x80\x99 claim of persecution because of \xe2\x80\x9cmembership in a particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thomas </em>v.<em> Ashcroft</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169, 1177 (2004).  The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc.  The en banc court, overruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit precedent, unanimously held that in principle \xe2\x80\x9ca family <em>may </em>constitute a social group for the purposes of the refugee statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 F.\xc2\xa03d 1177, 1187 (2005) (en banc) (emphasis added) (overruling, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Estrada-Posadas</em> v.<em> INS</em>, 924 F.\xc2\xa02d 916 (CA9 1991)).  In so doing, the court relied on earlier BIA opinions holding that certain \xe2\x80\x9ckinship ties\xe2\x80\x9d fall within the statutory term.  See <em>id</em>., at 1180, 1184-1186.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court then went on to hold, over the dissent of four judges, that the particular family at issue, namely \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98persons related to Boss Ronnie,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d fell within the scope of the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cparticular social group\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cThomases were attacked and threatened because they belonged to the particular social group of \xe2\x80\x98persons related to Boss Ronnie\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1189.  The dissenting judges argued that the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Thomases <em>are </em>a \xe2\x80\x98particular social group\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d should first be considered by the relevant administrative agency.  <em>Id</em>., at 1193 (opinion of Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original).  And they said that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision was inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>INS</em> v. <em>Orlando Ventura,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/12/index.html">537 U. S. 12</a>, 18 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General now asks us to grant certiorari to consider whether the Ninth Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cerred in holding, in the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions by the\xe2\x80\x9d relevant administrative agency, \xe2\x80\x9cthat members of a family can and do constitute a \xe2\x80\x98particular social group\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  Pet. for Cert. I.  He argues that a court\xe2\x80\x99s role in an immigration case is typically one of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98review, not of first view.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 29 (quoting <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/544/709/index.html">544 U. S. 709</a>, 718, n. 7 (2005)).  He adds that the decision clearly violates what this Court described in <em>Ventura </em>as the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary \xe2\x80\x98remand\xe2\x80\x99 rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 15 (quoting <em>Ventura</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 18).  And he concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s error is so obvious in light of <em>Ventura </em>that summary reversal would be appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the Solicitor General.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error is \xe2\x80\x9cobvious in light of <em>Ventura,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d itself a summary reversal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The alien in <em>Ventura </em>sought asylum on grounds of a reasonable fear of \xe2\x80\x9cpersecution\xe2\x80\x9d in Guatemala \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on account of \xe2\x80\xa6 [a] political opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U. S., at 13.  The BIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum because whatever persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in 1993 was not on account of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98political opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the record showed that in 1993 the alien did indeed face politically based persecution in Guatemala.  The Circuit then went on to consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument\xe2\x80\x94that, in any event, conditions within Guatemala had improved to the point that political persecution was no longer likely.  <em>Ibid</em>.  And the Circuit rejected this \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98changed circumstances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d claim without first giving the agency an opportunity to consider the matter.  <em>Id</em>., at 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily.  We pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency to make the basic asylum eligibility decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 16.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn such circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d we added, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting<em> SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/80/index.html">318 U. S. 80</a>, 88 (1943)).  \xe2\x80\x9cA court of appeals \xe2\x80\x98is not generally empowered to conduct a <em>de novo</em> inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ventura</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 16 (quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</em> v. <em>Lorion,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/729/index.html">470 U. S. 729</a>, 744 (1985)).  \xe2\x80\x9cRather, \xe2\x80\x98the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ventura</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 16 (quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 744; citing <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, 332 U. S.194, 196 (1947)).  Applying these \xe2\x80\x9cbasic legal principles,\xe2\x80\x9d we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cevery consideration that classically supports the law\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary remand requirement does so here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ventura</em>, 537 U. S.,<em> </em> at 16, 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must reach the same conclusion in the present case.  The agency has not yet considered whether Boss Ronnie\xe2\x80\x99s family presents the kind of \xe2\x80\x9ckinship ties\xe2\x80\x9d that constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cparticular social group.\xe2\x80\x9d  The matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.  And as we said in <em>Ventura:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can find no special circumstance here that might have justified the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the matter in the first instance.  Thus, as in <em>Ventura, </em>the Court of Appeals should have applied the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary \xe2\x80\x98remand\xe2\x80\x99 rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We grant the petition for certiorari.  We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  And we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
