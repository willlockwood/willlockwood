JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented by the certificate of division does not appear to us difficult of solution.  Upon principle, an act which is not an offense at the time it is committed cannot become such by any subsequent independent act of the party with which it has no connection.  By the clause in question, the obtaining of goods on credit upon false pretenses is made an offense against the United States, upon the happening of a subsequent event, not perhaps in the contemplation of the party, and which may be brought about, against his will, by the agency of another.  The criminal intent essential to the commission of a public offense must exist when the act complained of is done:  it cannot be imputed to a party from a subsequent independent transaction.  There are cases, it is true, where a series of acts are necessary to constitute an offense, one act being auxiliary to another in carrying out the criminal design.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 95 U. S. 672</a></p><p> But the present is not a case of that kind.  Here an act which may have no relation to proceedings in bankruptcy becomes criminal, according as such proceedings may or may not be subsequently taken, either by the party or by another.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt of the competency of Congress to provide, by suitable penalties, for the enforcement of all legislation necessary or proper to the execution of powers with which it is entrusted.  And as it is authorized "to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States," it may embrace within its legislation whatever may be deemed important to a complete and effective bankrupt system.  The object of such a system is to secure a ratable distribution of the bankrupt\'s estate among his creditors, when he is unable to discharge his obligations in full, and at the same time to relieve the honest debtor from legal proceedings for his debts, upon a surrender of his property.  The distribution of the property is the principal object to be attained.  The discharge of the debtor is merely incidental, and is granted only where his conduct has been free from fraud in the creation of his indebtedness or the disposition of his property.  To legislate for the prevention of frauds in either of these particulars, when committed in contemplation of bankruptcy, would seem to be within the competency of Congress.  Any act committed with a view of evading the legislation of Congress passed in the execution of any of its powers, or of fraudulently securing the benefit of such legislation, may properly be made an offense against the United States.  But an act committed within a state, whether for a good or a bad purpose, or whether with an honest or a criminal intent, cannot be made an offense against the United States, unless it have some relation to the execution of a power of Congress, or to some matter within the jurisdiction of the United States.  An act not having any such relation is one in respect to which the state can alone legislate.</p>\n<p>The act described in the ninth subdivision of sec. 5132 of the Revised Statutes is one which concerns only the state in which it is committed; it does not concern the United States.  It is quite possible that the framers of the statute intended it to apply only to acts committed in contemplation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 95 U. S. 673</a></p><p> of bankruptcy; but it does not say so, and we cannot supply qualifications which the legislature has failed to express.</p>\n<p>Our answer to the question certified must be in the negative, and it will be so returned to the circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
