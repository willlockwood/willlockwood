After a clinician injected respondent Levine with Phenergan by the \xe2\x80\x9cIV-push\xe2\x80\x9d method, whereby a drug is injected directly into a patient\xe2\x80\x99s vein, the drug entered Levine\xe2\x80\x99s artery, she developed gangrene, and doctors amputated her forearm.  Levine brought a state-law damages action, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that Wyeth had failed to provide an adequate warning about the significant risks of administering Phenergan by the IV-push method.  The Vermont jury determined that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury would not have occurred if Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label included an adequate warning, and it awarded damages for her pain and suffering, substantial medical expenses, and loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.  Declining to overturn the verdict, the trial court rejected Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law because Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling had been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Federal law does not pre-empt Levine\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label did not contain an adequate warning about the IV-push method of administration.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The argument that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties is rejected.  Although a manufacturer generally may change a drug label only after the FDA approves a supplemental application, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchanges being effected\xe2\x80\x9d (CBE) regulation permits certain preapproval labeling changes that add or strengthen a warning to improve drug safety.  Pursuant to the CBE regulation, Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration, and there is no evidence that the FDA would ultimately have rejected such a labeling change.  Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad assertion that unilaterally changing the Phenergan label would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution and misbranding of drugs are based on the fundamental misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling.  It is a central premise of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s argument that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is meritless because it relies on an untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s power to pre-empt state law.  The history of the FDCA shows that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.  In advancing the argument that the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily prescribed role.  Although an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of state law\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>.  Under this standard, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes; and it reverses the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.  <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U.

LEVINE<br/>\n555 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 06-1249<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">WYETH, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> DIANA LEVINE</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nvermont</p>\n<p align="left">[March 4, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Directly injecting the drug Phenergan into a patient\xe2\x80\x99s vein creates a significant risk of catastrophic consequences.  A Vermont jury found that petitioner Wyeth, the manufacturer of the drug, had failed to provide an adequate warning of that risk and awarded damages to respondent Diana Levine to compensate her for the amputation of her arm.  The warnings on Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label had been deemed sufficient by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it approved Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s new drug application in 1955 and when it later approved changes in the drug\xe2\x80\x99s labeling.  The question we must decide is whether the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s approvals provide Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine\xe2\x80\x99s tort claims.  We conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Phenergan is Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s brand name for promethazine hydrochloride, an antihistamine used to treat nausea.  The injectable form of Phenergan can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and it can be administered intravenously through either the \xe2\x80\x9cIV-push\xe2\x80\x9d method, whereby the drug is injected directly into a patient\xe2\x80\x99s vein, or the \xe2\x80\x9cIV-drip\xe2\x80\x9d method, whereby the drug is introduced into a saline solution in a hanging intravenous bag and slowly descends through a catheter inserted in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s vein.  The drug is corrosive and causes irreversible gangrene if it enters a patient\xe2\x80\x99s artery.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury resulted from an IV-push injection of Phenergan.  On April 7, 2000, as on previous visits to her local clinic for treatment of a migraine headache, she received an intramuscular injection of Demerol for her headache and Phenergan for her nausea.  Because the combination did not provide relief, she returned later that day and received a second injection of both drugs.  This time, the physician assistant administered the drugs by the IV-push method, and Phenergan entered Levine\xe2\x80\x99s artery, either because the needle penetrated an artery directly or because the drug escaped from the vein into surrounding tissue (a phenomenon called \xe2\x80\x9cperivascular extravasation\xe2\x80\x9d) where it came in contact with arterial blood.  As a result, Levine developed gangrene, and doctors amputated first her right hand and then her entire forearm.  In addition to her pain and suffering, Levine incurred substantial medical expenses and the loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After settling claims against the health center and clinician, Levine brought an action for damages against Wyeth, relying on common-law negligence and strict-liability theories.  Although Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling warned of the danger of gangrene and amputation following inadvertent intra-arterial injection,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] Levine alleged that the labeling was defective because it failed to instruct clinicians to use the IV-drip method of intravenous administration instead of the higher risk IV-push method.  More broadly, she alleged that Phenergan is not reasonably safe for intravenous administration because the foreseeable risks of gangrene and loss of limb are great in relation to the drug\xe2\x80\x99s therapeutic benefits.  App. 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law.  The court found no merit in either Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s field pre-emption argument, which it has since abandoned, or its conflict pre-emption argument.  With respect to the contention that there was an \xe2\x80\x9cactual conflict between a specific FDA order,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 21, and Levine\xe2\x80\x99s failure-to-warn action, the court reviewed the sparse correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA about Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling and found no evidence that Wyeth had \xe2\x80\x9cearnestly attempted\xe2\x80\x9d to strengthen the intra-arterial injection warning or that the FDA had \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically disallowed\xe2\x80\x9d stronger language, <em>id.</em>, at 23.  The record, as then developed, \xe2\x80\x9clack[ed] any evidence that the FDA set a ceiling on this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence presented during the 5-day jury trial showed that the risk of intra-arterial injection or perivascular extravasation can be almost entirely eliminated through the use of IV-drip, rather than IV-push, administration.  An IV drip is started with saline, which will not flow properly if the catheter is not in the vein and fluid is entering an artery or surrounding tissue.  See <em>id</em>., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351, 60, 66\xe2\x80\x9368, 75.  By contrast, even a careful and experienced clinician using the IV-push method will occasionally expose an artery to Phenergan.  See <em>id</em>., at 73, 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  While Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling warned against intra-arterial injection and perivascular extravasation and advised that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen administering any irritant drug intravenously it is usually preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be function-\ning satisfactorily,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.</em>, at 390, the labeling did not con-\ntain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push\nadministration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial record also contains correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA discussing Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label.  The FDA first approved injectable Phenergan in 1955.  In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the agency approved after proposing labeling changes.  Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels.  Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label.  The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes.  The FDA did not respond.  Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s 1988 submission, instructed it to \xe2\x80\x9c[r]etain verbiage in current label\xe2\x80\x9d regarding intra-arterial injection.  <em>Id</em>., at 359.  After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA approved Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s final printed label \xe2\x80\x9cmust be identical\xe2\x80\x9d to the approved package insert.  <em>Id</em>., at 382.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on this regulatory history, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider evidence of Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with FDA requirements but that such compliance did not establish that the warnings were adequate.  He also instructed, without objection from Wyeth, that FDA regulations \xe2\x80\x9cpermit a drug manufacturer to change a product label to add or strengthen a warning about its product without prior FDA approval so long as it later submits the revised warning for review and approval.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 228.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Answering questions on a special verdict form, the jury found that Wyeth was negligent, that Phenergan was a defective product as a result of inadequate warnings and instructions, and that no intervening cause had broken the causal connection between the product defects and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  <em>Id</em>., at 233\xe2\x80\x93235.  It awarded total damages of $7,400,000, which the court reduced to account for Levine\xe2\x80\x99s earlier settlement with the health center and clinician.  <em>Id.</em>, at 235\xe2\x80\x93236.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 3, 2004, the trial court filed a comprehensive opinion denying Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law.  After making findings of fact based on the trial record (supplemented by one letter that Wyeth found after the trial), the court rejected Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emption arguments.  It determined that there was no direct conflict between FDA regulations and Levine\xe2\x80\x99s state-law claims because those regulations permit strengthened warnings without FDA approval on an interim basis and the record contained evidence of at least 20 reports of amputations similar to Levine\xe2\x80\x99s since the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.  The court also found that state tort liability in this case would not obstruct the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s work because the agency had paid no more than passing attention to the question whether to warn against IV-push administration of Phenergan.  In addition, the court noted that state law serves a compensatory function distinct from federal regulation.  <em>Id</em>., at 249\xe2\x80\x93252.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  It held that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict \xe2\x80\x9cdid not conflict with FDA\xe2\x80\x99s labeling requirements for Phenergan because [Wyeth] could have warned against IV-push administration without prior FDA approval, and because federal labeling requirements create a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  ___ Vt. ___, ___ 944 A.\xc2\xa02d 179, 184 (2006).  In dissent, Chief Justice Reiber argued that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict conflicted with federal law because it was inconsistent with the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that intravenous administration of Phenergan was safe and effective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The importance of the pre-emption issue, coupled with the fact that the FDA has changed its position on state tort law and now endorses the views expressed in Chief Justice Reiber\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, persuaded us to grant Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).  The question presented by the petition is whether the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s drug labeling judgments \xe2\x80\x9cpreempt state law product liability claims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were necessary to make drugs reasonably safe for use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert.<em> i.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth makes two separate pre-emption arguments: first, that it would have been impossible for it to comply with the state-law duty to modify Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling without violating federal law, see Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>De la Cuesta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/141/index.html">458 U. S. 141</a>, 153 (1982), and second, that recognition of Levine\xe2\x80\x99s state tort action creates an unacceptable \xe2\x80\x9cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U. S. 52</a>, 67 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision about drug labeling for the expert judgment of the FDA.  As a preface to our evaluation of these arguments, we identify two factual propositions decided during the trial court proceedings, emphasize two legal principles that guide our analysis, and review the history of the controlling federal statute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court proceedings established that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury would not have occurred if Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label had included an adequate warning about the risks of the IV-push method of administering the drug.  The record contains evidence that the physician assistant administered a greater dose than the label prescribed, that she may have inadvertently injected the drug into an artery rather than a vein, and that she continued to inject the drug after Levine complained of pain.  Nevertheless, the jury rejected Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the clinician\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was an intervening cause that absolved it of liability.  See App. 234 (jury verdict), 252\xe2\x80\x93254.  In finding Wyeth negligent as well as strictly liable, the jury also determined that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury was foreseeable.  That the inadequate label was both a but-for and proximate cause of Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury is supported by the record and no longer challenged by Wyeth.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court proceedings further established that the critical defect in Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label was the lack of an adequate warning about the risks of IV-push administration.  Levine also offered evidence that the IV-push method should be contraindicated and that Phenergan should never be administered intravenously, even by the IV-drip method.  Perhaps for this reason, the dissent incorrectly assumes that the state-law duty at issue is the duty to contraindicate the IV-push method.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 8, 25.  But, as the Vermont Supreme Court explained, the jury verdict established only that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s warning was insufficient.  It did not mandate a particular replacement warning, nor did it require contraindicating IV-push administration: \xe2\x80\x9cThere may have been any number of ways for [Wyeth] to strengthen the Phenergan warning without completely eliminating IV-push administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  ___ Vt., at ___, n.\xc2\xa02, 944 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 189, n.\xc2\xa02.  We therefore need not decide whether a state rule proscribing intravenous administration would be pre-empted.  The narrower question presented is whether federal law pre-empts Levine\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label did not contain an adequate warning about using the IV-push method of administration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our answer to that question must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence.  First, \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Retail Clerks</em> v. <em>Schermerhorn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/96/index.html">375 U. S. 96</a>, 103 (1963).  Second, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has \xe2\x80\x98legislated \xe2\x80\xa6 in a field which the States have traditionally occupied,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 we \xe2\x80\x98start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U. S., at 485 (quoting <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/index.html">331 U. S. 218</a>, 230 (1947)).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d it is appropriate to briefly review the history of federal regulation of drugs and drug labeling.  In 1906, Congress enacted its first significant public health law, the Federal Food and Drugs Act, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768.  The Act, which prohibited the manufacture or interstate shipment of adulterated or misbranded drugs, supplemented the protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and common-law liability.  In the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, Congress became increasingly concerned about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7301 <em>et seq.</em>  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s most substantial innovation was its provision for premarket approval of new drugs.  It required every manufacturer to submit a new drug application, including reports of investigations and specimens of proposed labeling, to the FDA for review.  Until its application became effective, a manufacturer was prohibited from distributing a drug.  The FDA could reject an application if it determined that the drug was not safe for use as labeled, though if the agency failed to act, an application became effective 60 days after the filing.   FDCA, \xc2\xa7505(c), 52 Stat. 1052.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA and shifted the burden of proof from the FDA to the manufacturer.  Before 1962, the agency had to prove harm to keep a drug out of the market, but the amendments required the manufacturer to demonstrate that its drug was \xe2\x80\x9csafe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling\xe2\x80\x9d before it could distribute the drug.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(d), 104(b), 76 Stat. 781, 784.  In addition, the amendments required the manufacturer to prove the drug\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness by introducing \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7102(d), <em>id.</em>, at 781.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As it enlarged the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s powers to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the public health\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassure the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 780, Congress took care to preserve state law.  The 1962 amendments added a saving clause, indicating that a provision of state law would only be invalidated upon a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect and positive conflict\xe2\x80\x9d with the FDCA.  \xc2\xa7202, <em>id.</em>, at 793.  Consistent with that provision, state common-law suits \xe2\x80\x9ccontinued unabated despite \xe2\x80\xa6 FDA regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riegel</em> v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 8) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa011 (collecting state cases).  And when Congress enacted an express pre-emption provision for medical devices in 1976, see \xc2\xa7521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a)), it declined to enact such a provision for prescription drugs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2007, after Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury and lawsuit, Congress again amended the FDCA.  121 Stat. 823.  For the first time, it granted the FDA statutory authority to require a manufacturer to change its drug label based on safety information that becomes available after a drug\xe2\x80\x99s initial approval.  \xc2\xa7901(a), <em>id.</em>, at 924\xe2\x80\x93926.  In doing so, however, Congress did not enact a provision in the Senate bill that would have required the FDA to preapprove all changes to drug labels.  See S.\xc2\xa01082, 110th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa7208, pp.\xc2\xa0107\xe2\x80\x93114 (2007) (as passed) (proposing new \xc2\xa7506D).  Instead, it adopted a rule of construction to make it clear that manufacturers remain responsible for updating their labels.  See 121 Stat. 925\xe2\x80\x93926.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth first argues that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for it to comply with both the state-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties.  See <em>De la Cuesta</em>, 458 U. S., at 153.  The FDA\xe2\x80\x99s premarket approval of a new drug application includes the approval of the exact text in the proposed label.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355; 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.105(b) (2008).  Generally speaking, a manufacturer may only change a drug label after the FDA approves a supplemental application.  There is, however, an FDA regulation that permits a manufacturer to make certain changes to its label before receiving the agency\xe2\x80\x99s approval.  Among other things, this \xe2\x80\x9cchanges being effected\xe2\x80\x9d (CBE) regulation provides that if a manufacturer is changing a label to \xe2\x80\x9cadd or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cadd or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\xe2\x80\x9d it may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA; it need not wait for FDA approval.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth argues that the CBE regulation is not implicated in this case because a 2008 amendment provides that a manufacturer may only change its label \xe2\x80\x9cto reflect newly acquired information.\xe2\x80\x9d  73 Fed. Reg. 49609.  Resting on this language (which Wyeth argues simply reaffirmed the interpretation of the regulation in effect when this case was tried), Wyeth contends that it could have changed Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label only in response to new information that the FDA had not considered.  And it maintains that Levine has not pointed to any such information concerning the risks of IV-push administration.  Thus, Wyeth insists, it was impossible for it to discharge its state-law obligation to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration without violating federal law.  Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s argument misapprehends both the federal drug regulatory scheme and its burden in establishing a pre-emption defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide whether the 2008 CBE regulation is consistent with the FDCA and the previous version of the regulation, as Wyeth and the United States urge, because Wyeth could have revised Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label even in accordance with the amended regulation.  As the FDA explained in its notice of the final rule, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98newly acquired information\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is not limited to new data, but also encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cnew analyses of previously submitted data.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49604.  The rule accounts for the fact that risk information accumulates over time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in light of subsequent developments: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the sponsor submits adverse event information to FDA, and then later conducts a new analysis of data showing risks of a different type or of greater severity or frequency than did reports previously submitted to FDA, the sponsor meets the requirement for \xe2\x80\x98newly acquired information.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49607; see also <em>id.</em>, at 49606.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record is limited concerning what newly acquired information Wyeth had or should have had about the risks of IV-push administration of Phenergan because Wyeth did not argue before the trial court that such information was required for a CBE labeling change.  Levine did, however, present evidence of at least 20 incidents prior to her injury in which a Phenergan injection resulted in gangrene and an amputation.  See App. 74, 252.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  After the first such incident came to Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s attention in 1967, it notified the FDA and worked with the agency to change Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label.  In later years, as amputations continued to occur, Wyeth could have analyzed the accumulating data and added a stronger warning about IV-push administration of the drug.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth argues that if it had unilaterally added such a warning, it would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution and misbranding.  Its argument that a change in Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling would have subjected it to liability for unauthorized distribution rests on the assumption that this labeling change would have rendered Phenergan a new drug lacking an effective application.  But strengthening the warning about IV-push administration would not have made Phenergan a new drug.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7321(p)(1) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cnew drug\xe2\x80\x9d); 21 CFR \xc2\xa7310.3(h).  Nor would this warning have rendered Phenergan misbranded.  The FDCA does not provide that a drug is misbranded simply because the manufacturer has altered an FDA-approved label; instead, the misbranding provision focuses on the substance of the label and, among other things, proscribes labels that fail to include \xe2\x80\x9cadequate warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7352(f).  Moreover, because the statute contemplates that federal juries will resolve most misbranding claims, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s belief that a drug is misbranded is not conclusive.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7331, 332, 334(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  And the very idea that the FDA would bring an enforcement action against a manufacturer for strengthening a warning pursuant to the CBE regulation is difficult to accept\xe2\x80\x94neither Wyeth nor the United States has identified a case in which the FDA has done so.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad reading of the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s misbranding and unauthorized distribution provisions are premised on a more fundamental misunderstanding.  Wyeth suggests that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling.  Yet through many amendments to the FDCA and to FDA regulations, it has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.  It is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.  See, <em>e.g</em>., 21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.80(e) (requiring a manufacturer to revise its label \xe2\x80\x9cto include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> </em>\xc2\xa7314.80(b) (placing responsibility for postmarketing surveillance on the manufacturer); 73 Fed. Reg. 49605 (\xe2\x80\x9cManufacturers continue to have a responsibility under Federal law \xe2\x80\xa6 to maintain their labeling and update the labeling with new safety information\xe2\x80\x9d).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, prior to 2007, the FDA lacked the authority to order manufacturers to revise their labels.  See 121 Stat. 924\xe2\x80\x93926.  When Congress granted the FDA this authority, it reaffirmed the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s obligations and referred specifically to the CBE regulation, which both reflects the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding safety information to the label prior to FDA approval.  See <em>id.</em>, at 925\xe2\x80\x93926<em> </em>(stating that a manufacturer retains the responsibility \xe2\x80\x9cto maintain its label in accordance with existing requirements, including subpart B of part 201 and <em>sections</em> <em>314.70</em> and 601.12 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Thus, when the risk of gangrene from IV-push injection of Phenergan became apparent, Wyeth had a duty to provide a warning that adequately described that risk, and the CBE regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s approval.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the FDA retains authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation in its review of the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s supplemental application, just as it retains such authority in reviewing all supplemental applications.  But absent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label, we will not conclude that it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.<font b="1"> </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth has offered no such evidence.  It does not argue that it attempted to give the kind of warning required by the Vermont jury but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\xe2\x80\x9313; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25.  And while it does suggest that the FDA intended to prohibit it from strengthening the warning about IV-push administration because the agency deemed such a warning inappropriate in reviewing Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s drug applications, both the trial court and the Vermont Supreme Court rejected this account as a matter of fact.  In its decision on Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial court found \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence in this record that either the FDA or the manufacturer gave more than passing attention to the issue of\xe2\x80\x9d IV-push versus IV-drip administration.  App. 249.  The Vermont Supreme Court likewise concluded that the FDA had not made an affirmative decision to preserve the IV-push method or intended to prohibit Wyeth from strengthening its warning about IV-push administration.  ___ Vt., at ___, 944 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 188\xe2\x80\x93189.  Moreover, Wyeth does not argue that it supplied the FDA with an evaluation or analysis concerning the specific dangers posed by the IV-push method.<font b="1">  We accordingly cannot credit Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the FDA would have prevented it from adding a stronger warning about the IV-push method of intravenous administration.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Impossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense.  On the record before us, Wyeth has failed to demonstrate that it was impossible for it to comply with both federal and state requirements.  The CBE regulation permitted Wyeth to unilaterally strengthen its warning, and the mere fact that the FDA approved Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label does not establish that it would have prohibited such a change.  </font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth also argues that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration would obstruct the purposes and objectives of federal drug labeling regulation.  Levine\xe2\x80\x99s tort claims, it maintains, are pre-empted because they interfere with \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to entrust an expert agency to make drug labeling decisions that strike a balance between competing objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 46.  We find no merit in this argument, which relies on an untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s power to pre-empt state law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth contends that the FDCA establishes both a floor and a ceiling for drug regulation: Once the FDA has approved a drug\xe2\x80\x99s label, a state-law verdict may not deem the label inadequate, regardless of whether there is any evidence that the FDA has considered the stronger warning at issue.  The most glaring problem with this argument is that all evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes is to the contrary.  Building on its 1906 Act, Congress enacted the FDCA to bolster consumer protection against harmful products.  See <em>Kordel</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/345/index.html">335 U. S. 345</a>, 349 (1948);<em> United States</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/689/index.html">332 U. S. 689</a>, 696 (1948).  Congress did not provide a federal remedy for consumers harmed by unsafe or ineffective drugs in the 1938 statute or in any subsequent amendment.  Evidently, it determined that widely available state rights of action provided appropriate relief for injured consumers.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It may also have recognized that state-law remedies further consumer protection by motivating manufacturers to produce safe and effective drugs and to give adequate warnings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express pre-emption provision at some point during the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s 70-year history.  But despite its 1976 enactment of an express pre-emption provision for medical devices, see \xc2\xa7521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k(a)), Congress has not enacted such a provision for prescription drugs.<em> </em>See <em>Riegel</em>, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cCongress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA.  It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Its silence on the issue, coupled with its certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation, is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.  As Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor explained in her opinion for a unanimous Court: \xe2\x80\x9cThe case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bonito Boats, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/141/index.html">489 U. S. 141</a>, 166\xe2\x80\x93167 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 8 (discussing the presumption against pre-emption).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this evidence that Congress did not regard state tort litigation as an obstacle to achieving its purposes, Wyeth nonetheless maintains that, because the FDCA requires the FDA to determine that a drug is safe and effective under the conditions set forth in its labeling, the agency must be presumed to have performed a precise balancing of risks and benefits and to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments.  In advancing this argument, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress, but instead on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation governing the content and format of prescription drug labels.  See Brief for Petitioner 8, 11, 42, 45, and 50 (citing 71 Fed. Reg. 3922 (2006)).  In that preamble, the FDA declared that the FDCA establishes \xe2\x80\x9cboth a \xe2\x80\x98floor\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98ceiling,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d so that \xe2\x80\x9cFDA approval of labeling \xe2\x80\xa6 preempts conflicting or contrary State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3934\xe2\x80\x933935.  It further stated that certain state-law actions, such as those involving failure-to-warn claims, \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten FDA\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily prescribed role as the expert Federal agency responsible for evaluating and regulating drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 3935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has recognized that an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a> (2000); <em>Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Laboratories</em>,<em> Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/707/index.html">471 U. S. 707</a>, 713 (1985).  In such cases, the Court has performed its own conflict determination, relying on the substance of state and federal law and not on agency proclamations of pre-emption.  We are faced with no such regulation in this case, but rather with an agency\xe2\x80\x99s mere assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Because Congress has not authorized the FDA to pre-empt state law directly, cf. 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7360k (authorizing the FDA to determine the scope of the Medical Devices Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emption clause),[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] the question is what weight we should accord the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In prior cases, we have given \xe2\x80\x9csome weight\xe2\x80\x9d to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s views about the impact of tort law on federal objectives when \xe2\x80\x9cthe subject matter is technica[l] and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S., at 883.  Even in such cases, however, we have not deferred to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s <em>conclusion</em> that state law is pre-empted.  Rather, we have attended to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of how state law affects the regulatory scheme.  While agencies have no special authority to pronounce on pre-emption absent delegation by Congress, they do have a unique understanding of the statutes they administer and an attendant ability to make informed determinations about how state requirements may pose an \xe2\x80\x9cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hines</em>, 312 U.S, at 67; see <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S., at 883; <em>Lohr</em>, 518 U. S., at 495\xe2\x80\x93496.  The weight we accord the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of state law\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 234\xe2\x80\x93235 (2001); <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/index.html">323 U. S. 134</a>, 140 (1944).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this standard, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 preamble does not merit deference.  When the FDA issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in December 2000, it explained that the rule would \xe2\x80\x9cnot contain policies that have federalism implications or that preempt State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  65 Fed. Reg. 81103; see also 71 <em>id.</em>, at 3969 (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cproposed rule did not propose to preempt state law\xe2\x80\x9d).  In 2006, the agency finalized the rule and, without offering States or other interested parties notice or opportunity for comment, articulated a sweeping position on the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive effect in the regulatory preamble.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s views on state law are inherently suspect in light of this procedural failure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the preamble is at odds with what evidence we have of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes, and it reverses the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s own longstanding position without providing a reasoned explanation, including any discussion of how state law has interfered with the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of drug labeling during decades of coexistence.  The FDA\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 position plainly does not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own view at all times relevant to this litigation.  Not once prior to Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury did the FDA suggest that state tort law stood as an obstacle to its statutory mission.  To the contrary, it cast federal labeling standards as a floor upon which States could build and repeatedly disclaimed any attempt to pre-empt failure-to-warn claims.  For instance, in 1998, the FDA stated that it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot believe that the evolution of state tort law [would] cause the development of standards that would be at odds with the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  63 <em>id.</em>, at 66384.  It further noted that, in establishing \xe2\x80\x9cminimal standards\xe2\x80\x9d for drug labels, it did not intend \xe2\x80\x9cto preclude the states from imposing additional labeling requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In keeping with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to pre-empt common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation.  The FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and manufacturers have superior access to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.  State tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly.  They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with information.  Failure-to-warn actions, in particular, lend force to the FDCA\xe2\x80\x99s premise that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear primary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times.  Thus, the FDA long maintained that state law offers an additional, and important, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 preamble represents a dramatic change in position.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Largely based on the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s new position, Wyeth argues that this case presents a conflict between state and federal law analogous to the one at issue in <em>Geier</em>.  There, we held that state tort claims premised on Honda\xe2\x80\x99s failure to install airbags conflicted with a federal regulation that did not require airbags for all cars.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promulgated a rule that provided car manufacturers with a range of choices among passive restraint devices.  <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S., at 875.  Rejecting an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all airbag\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d standard, the agency had called for a gradual phase-in of a mix of passive restraints in order to spur technological development and win consumer acceptance.  <em>Id., </em>at 879.  Because the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim was that car manufacturers had a duty to install airbags, it presented an obstacle to achieving \xe2\x80\x9cthe variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 881.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyeth and the dissent contend that the regulatory scheme in this case is nearly identical, but, as we have described, it is quite different.  In <em>Geier</em>, the DOT conducted a formal rulemaking and then adopted a plan to phase in a mix of passive restraint devices.  Examining the rule itself and the DOT\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous record, which revealed the factors the agency had weighed and the balance it had struck, we determined that state tort suits presented an obstacle to the federal scheme.  After conducting our own pre-emption analysis, we considered the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of how state law interfered with its regulation, regarding it as further support for our independent conclusion that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tort claim obstructed the federal regime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, we have no occasion in this case to consider the pre-emptive effect of a specific agency regulation bearing the force of law.  And the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s newfound opinion, expressed in its 2006 preamble, that state law \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrate[s] the agency\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of its statutory mandate,\xe2\x80\x9d 71 Fed. Reg. 3934, does not merit deference for the reasons we have explained.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex and extensive\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory history and background relevant to this case, <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S., at 883, undercut the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s recent pronouncements of pre-emption, as they reveal the longstanding coexistence of state and federal law and the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s traditional recognition of state-law remedies\xe2\x80\x94a recognition in place each time the agency reviewed Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s Phenergan label.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, Wyeth has not persuaded us that failure-to-warn claims like Levine\xe2\x80\x99s obstruct the federal regulation of drug labeling.  Congress has repeatedly declined to pre-empt state law, and the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s recently adopted position that state tort suits interfere with its statutory mandate is entitled to no weight.

Reports compatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan Injection, usually in conjunction with other drugs intended for intravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation, severe spasm of distal vessels, and resultant gangrene requiring amputation are likely under such circumstances.  Intravenous injection was intended in all the cases reported but perivascular extravasation or arterial placement of the needle is now suspect.  There is no proven successful management of this condition after it occurs. . . . Aspiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored upon contact with Phenergan Injection.  Use of syringes with rigid plungers or of small bore needles might obscure typical arterial backflow if this is relied upon alone.  When used intravenously, Phenergan Injection should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg per mL and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg per minute.  When administering any irritant drug intravenously, it is usually preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily.  In the event that a patient complains of pain during intended intravenous injection of Phenergan Injection, the injection should be stopped immediately to provide for evaluation of possible arterial placement or perivascular extravasation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 390.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent nonetheless suggests that physician malpractice was the exclusive cause of Levine\xe2\x80\x99s injury.

In 1988, Wyeth did propose different language for Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s warning about intra-arterial injection, adapted from revisions the FDA proposed in 1987.  See App. 339\xe2\x80\x93341, 311\xe2\x80\x93312.  When the FDA approved Wyeth\xe2\x80\x99s application, it instructed Wyeth to retain the wording in its current label.  During the trial court proceedings, Levine indicated that the language proposed in 1988 would have more strongly warned against IV-push administration.  But the trial court and the Vermont Supreme Court found that the 1988 warning did not differ in any material respect from the FDA-approved warning.  See ___ Vt. ___, ___, 944 A.\xc2\xa02d 179, 189 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cSimply stated, the proposed warning was different, but not stronger.

Under federal law, without prior approval from the FDA, Wyeth could have \xe2\x80\x9cadd[ed] or strengthen[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d information on its label about \xe2\x80\x9ca contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2008), or \xe2\x80\x9cabout dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to \xe2\x80\x9creflect newly acquired information,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cnew analyses of previously submitted data,\xe2\x80\x9d about the dangers of IV-push administration of Phenergan, 73 Fed.

It thus was possible for Wyeth to label and market Phenergan in compliance with federal law while also providing additional warning information on its label beyond that previously approved by the FDA.

There could be instances where it is not \xe2\x80\x9cphysically impossible\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with both state and federal law, even when the state and federal laws give directly conflicting commands.  See Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 225, 260\xe2\x80\x93261 (2000).  For example, if federal law gives an individual the right to engage in certain behavior that state law prohibits, the laws would give contradictory commands notwithstanding the fact that an individual could comply with both by electing to refrain from the covered behavior.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cphysical impossibility\xe2\x80\x9d may not be the most appropriate standard for determining whether the text of state and federal laws directly conflict.  See <em>ibid.</em> <em> </em>(concluding that the Supremacy Clause does not limit direct conflicts to cases with \xe2\x80\x9cphysically impossible\xe2\x80\x9d conflicts and arguing that evidence from the Founding supports a standard of \xe2\x80\x9clogical-contradiction\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>AT&amp;T</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 227 (requiring that the state-law claims \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly conflict\xe2\x80\x9d with federal law); 3 Story \xc2\xa71836, at 701 (suggesting instead that a state law is pre-empted by the Supremacy Clause when it is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>repugnant</em> to the constitution of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, whatever the precise constitutional contours of implied pre-emption may be, I am satisfied that it does not operate against respondent\xe2\x80\x99s judgment below.  The text of the federal laws at issue do not require that the state-court judgment at issue be pre-empted, under either the narrow \xe2\x80\x9cphysical impossibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard, <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 142\xe2\x80\x93143, or a more general \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t] conflict\xe2\x80\x9d standard, <em>AT&amp;T</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchanges being effected\xe2\x80\x9d regulation, 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii), which was promulgated pursuant to the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory authority, it is physically possible for Wyeth to market Phenergan in compliance with federal and Vermont law.  As the majority explains, Wyeth could have changed the warning on its label regarding IV-push without violating federal law.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  The \xe2\x80\x9cchanges being effected\xe2\x80\x9d regulation allows drug manufacturers to change their labels without the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s preapproval if the changes \xe2\x80\x9cadd or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or \xe2\x80\x9cadd or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to \xe2\x80\x9creflect newly acquired information,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cnew analyses of previously submitted data,\xe2\x80\x9d 73 Fed. Reg. 49603, 49609.  Under the terms of these regulations, after learning of new incidences of gangrene-induced amputation resulting from the IV-push administration of Phenergan, see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, federal law gave Wyeth the authority to change Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label to \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthen a \xe2\x80\xa6 warning,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthen a \xe2\x80\xa6 precaution,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or to \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthen an instruction about \xe2\x80\xa6 administration [of the IV-push method] \xe2\x80\xa6 to increase the safe use of the drug product,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C).  Thus, it was physically possible for Wyeth to comply with a state-law requirement to provide stronger warnings on Phenergan about the risks of the IV-push administration method while continuing to market Phenergan in compliance with federal law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the text of the statutory provisions governing FDA drug labeling, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, do not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved drug at all times with the precise label initially approved by the FDA. Thus, there is no \xe2\x80\x9cdirect conflict\xe2\x80\x9d between the federal labeling law and the state-court judgment.  The statute prohibits the interstate marketing of any drug, except for those that are federally approved.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>No person shall</em> introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug, <em>unless</em> an approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (b) or (j) of this section is effective with respect to such drug\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  To say, as the statute does, that Wyeth may not market a drug without federal approval (<em>i.e.</em>, without an FDA-approved label) is not to say that federal approval gives Wyeth the unfettered right, for all time, to market its drug with the specific label that was federally approved.  Initial approval of a label amounts to a finding by the FDA that the label is safe for purposes of gaining federal approval to market the drug.  It does not represent a finding that the drug, as labeled, can never be deemed unsafe by later federal action, or as in this case, the application of state law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, FDA regulations require a drug manufacturer\xe2\x80\x94after initial federal approval of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s label\xe2\x80\x94to revise the federally approved label \xe2\x80\x9cto include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7201.80(e).  Drug manufacturers are also required to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish and maintain records and make reports\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA about \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related,\xe2\x80\x9d after it has received federal approval.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314.80(a), (c), (j).

The Court did not find that the two statutes, by their terms, directly conflicted.  See <em>Hines</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 59\xe2\x80\x9360, and n.\xc2\xa01 (citing Pa. Stat.

Rather, it went on to ask whether the state law \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 67.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so doing, the Court looked far beyond the relevant federal statutory text and instead embarked on its own freeranging speculation about what the purposes of the federal law must have been.  See <em>id.,</em> at 69\xe2\x80\x9374.  In addition to the meaning of the relevant federal text, the Court attempted to discern \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he nature of the power exerted by Congress, the object sought to be attained, and the character of the obligations imposed by the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 70.  To do so, the Court looked in part to public sentiment, noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]pposition to laws \xe2\x80\xa6 singling out aliens as particularly dangerous and undesirable groups, is deep-seated in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court also relied on statements by particular Members of Congress and on congressional inaction, finding it pertinent that numerous bills with requirements similar to Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s law had failed to garner enough votes in Congress to become law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 71\xe2\x80\x9373, and nn.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9334.  Concluding that these sources revealed a federal purpose to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that the Pennsylvania law was pre-empted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 74.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stone, in dissent, questioned the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to read an exclusive registration system for aliens into a statute that did not specifically provide such exclusivity.  See <em>id.</em>, at 75.  He noted his concern that state power would be improperly diminished through a pre-emption doctrine driven by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown conceptions of a policy which Congress ha[d] not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it ha[d] enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In his view, nothing that Congress enacted had \xe2\x80\x9cdenie[d] the states the practicable means of identifying their alien residents and of recording their whereabouts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 78.  Yet, the <em>Hines </em>majority employed pre-emption to override numerous state alien-registration laws even though enacted federal law \xe2\x80\x9cat no point conflict[ed] with the state legislation and [was] harmonious with it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 79.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequences of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s broad approach to \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption are exemplified in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Geier</em>, which both the majority and the dissent incorporate into their analysis today.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, and nn. 13\xe2\x80\x9314; <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x939 (opinion of Alito, J.).  In <em>Geier</em>, pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71381 <em>et seq.</em> (1988 ed.), the Department of Transportation (DOT) had promulgated a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that \xe2\x80\x9crequired auto manufacturers to equip some but not all of their 1987 vehicles with passive restraints.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S., at 864\xe2\x80\x93865.  The case required this Court to decide whether the Safety Act pre-empted a state common-law tort action in which the plaintiff claimed that an auto manufacturer, though in compliance with the federal standard, should nonetheless have equipped a 1987 automobile with airbags.  <em>Id.</em>, at 865.  The Court first concluded that the Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption provision and its saving clause, read together, did not expressly pre-empt state common-law claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 867\xe2\x80\x93868.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court then proceeded to consider whether the state action was nonetheless pre-empted as an \xe2\x80\x9cobstacle\xe2\x80\x9d to the purposes of the federal law.  The Court held that the state tort claim was pre-empted, relying in large part on comments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, statements that the Government made in its brief to the Court, and regulatory history that related to the federal regulation of passive restraints.  See <em>id.</em>, at 874\xe2\x80\x93886.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In particular, the majority found that DOT intended to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately provid[e] the manufacturer[s] with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cbring about a mix of different devices introduced gradually over time,\xe2\x80\x9d based on comments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, rather than the Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s text.  <em>Id.</em>, at 875.  The majority also embarked on a judicial inquiry into \xe2\x80\x9cwhy and how DOT sought these objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, by considering regulatory history and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, which described DOT\xe2\x80\x99s safety standard as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98embod[ying] the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed <em>alternative</em> protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 881 (quoting Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1999, No. 98\xe2\x80\x931811, p.\xc2\xa025); see also 529 U.

See <em>Watters</em> v. <em>Wachovia Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/1/index.html">550 U.

Thus, no agency or individual Member of Congress can pre-empt a State\xe2\x80\x99s judgment by merely musing about goals or intentions not found within or authorized by the statutory text.

See <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 904 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (finding no evidence to support the notion that the DOT Secretary intended to advance the purposes of the safety standard \xe2\x80\x9cat all costs\xe2\x80\x9d); Nelson, 86 Va.

As this Court has repeatedly noted, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever</em> furthers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective must be the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Norfolk Southern R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/158/index.html">549 U.

Therefore, there is no factual basis for the assumption underlying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption jurisprudence that every policy seemingly consistent with federal statutory text has necessarily been authorized by Congress and warrants pre-emptive effect.  Instead, our federal system in general, and the Supremacy Clause in particular, accords pre-emptive effect to only those policies that are actually authorized by and effectuated through the statutory text.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, while reaching the right conclusion in this case, demonstrates once again how application of \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d pre-emption requires inquiry into matters beyond the scope of proper judicial review.  For example, the majority relies heavily on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure \xe2\x80\x9cduring the \xe2\x80\xa6 70-year history\xe2\x80\x9d of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enact an express pre-emption provision that addresses approval of a drug label by the FDA.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  That \xe2\x80\x9csilence on the issue, coupled with [Congress\xe2\x80\x99] certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority reasons, is evidence that Congress did not intend for federal approval of drug labels to pre-empt state tort judgments.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (construing from inaction that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c[e]vidently [had] determined that widely available state rights of action provided appropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d).  Certainly, the absence of a statutory provision pre-empting all state tort suits related to approved federal drug labels is pertinent to a finding that such lawsuits are not pre-empted.  But the relevance is in the fact that no statute explicitly pre-empts the lawsuits, and not in any inferences that the Court may draw from congressional silence about the motivations or policies underlying Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to act.  See <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U.

See <em>ante, </em>at 18.  That is the required conclusion, but only because it is compelled by the text of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, not judicial suppositions about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 unstated goals.  The fact that the Court reaches the proper conclusion does not justify its speculation about the reasons for congressional inaction.  In this case, the Court has relied on the perceived congressional policies underlying inaction to find that state law is <em>not </em>pre-empted.  But once the Court shows a willingness to guess at the intent underlying congressional inaction, the Court could just as easily rely on its own perceptions regarding congressional inaction to give unduly broad pre-emptive effect to federal law.

The majority and dissent in <em>Geier</em> agreed that the import of the express pre-emption provision and the saving clause, read together, was that by its terms, the Safety Act did not expressly pre-empt state common-law actions.

As the dissent in <em>Geier</em> pointed out, the purpose of the Safety Act, as stated by Congress, was generally \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 888\xe2\x80\x93889 (opinion of Stevens, J.)

On its face, that goal is of course consistent with a state-law judgment that a particular vehicle needed a passive restraint system that would better protect persons from death and injury during traffic accidents.  Furthermore, the dissent observed that \xe2\x80\x9cby definition all of the standards established under the Safety Act \xe2\x80\xa6 impose minimum, rather than fixed or maximum, requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U.

The Court holds that a state tort jury, rather than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs.

But that ignores the antecedent question of who\xe2\x80\x94the FDA or a jury in Vermont\xe2\x80\x94has the authority and responsibility for determining the \xe2\x80\x9cadequacy\xe2\x80\x9d of Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s warnings.  Moreover, it is unclear how a \xe2\x80\x9cstronger\xe2\x80\x9d warning could have helped respondent, see <em>ante</em>, at 16; after all, the physician\xe2\x80\x99s assistant who treated her disregarded at least six separate warnings that are already on Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling, so respondent would be hard pressed to prove that a seventh would have made a difference.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More to the point, the question presented by this case is not a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow\xe2\x80\x9d one, and it does not concern whether Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label should bear a \xe2\x80\x9cstronger\xe2\x80\x9d warning.  Rather, the real issue is whether a state tort jury can countermand the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s considered judgment that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s FDA-mandated warning label renders its intravenous (IV) use \xe2\x80\x9csafe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint alleged that Phenergan is \xe2\x80\x9cnot reasonably safe for intravenous administration,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 15, \xc2\xb66; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney told the jury that Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label should say, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Do not use this drug intravenously,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 32; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s expert told the jury, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the drug should be labeled \xe2\x80\x98Not for IV use,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 59; and during his closing argument, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney told the jury, \xe2\x80\x9cThank God we don\xe2\x80\x99t rely on the FDA to \xe2\x80\xa6 make the safe[ty] decision.

The FDA has long known about the risks associated with IV push in general and its use to administer Phenergan in particular.  Whether wisely or not, the FDA has concluded\xe2\x80\x94over the course of extensive, 54-year-long regulatory proceedings\xe2\x80\x94that the drug is \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d when used in accordance with its FDA-mandated labeling.  The unfortunate fact that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare providers ignored Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s labeling may make this an ideal medical-malpractice case.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  But turning a common-law tort suit into a \xe2\x80\x9cfrontal assault\xe2\x80\x9d on the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory regime for drug labeling upsets the well-settled meaning of the Supremacy Clause and our conflict pre-emption jurisprudence.

See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(a).  An NDA must contain, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cthe labeling proposed to be used for such drug,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7355(b)(1)(F), \xe2\x80\x9cfull reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7355(b)(1)(A), and \xe2\x80\x9ca discussion of why the benefits exceed the risks [of the drug] under the conditions stated in the labeling,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 CFR \xc2\xa7314.50(d)(5)(viii) (2008).  The FDA will approve an NDA only if the agency finds, among other things, that the drug is \xe2\x80\x9csafe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d there is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d and the proposed labeling is not \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or misleading in any particular.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U.

Reg. 3934 (2006).  The FDA has underscored the importance it places on drug labels by promulgating comprehensive regulations\xe2\x80\x94spanning an entire part of the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR pt. 201, with seven subparts and 70 separate sections\xe2\x80\x94that set forth drug manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 labeling obligations.  Under those regulations, the FDA must be satisfied that a drug\xe2\x80\x99s warning label contains, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ca summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201.56(1), including a description of \xe2\x80\x9cclinically significant adverse reactions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cother potential safety hazards,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9climitations in use imposed by them, \xe2\x80\xa6 and steps that should be taken if they occur,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201.57(c)(6)(i).

Indeed, that result follows directly from our conclusion in <em>Geier</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Geier</em> arose under the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act of 1966, which directs the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish by order \xe2\x80\xa6 motor vehicle safety standards,\xe2\x80\x9d 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71392(a) (1988 ed.), which are defined as \xe2\x80\x9cminimum standard[s] for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment performance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71391(2).  Acting pursuant to that statutory mandate, the Secretary of Transportation promulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which required car manufacturers to include passive restraint systems (<em>i.e.</em>, devices that work automatically to protect occupants from injury during a collision) in a certain percentage of their cars built in or after 1987.  See 49 CFR \xc2\xa7571.208 (1999).  Standard 208 did not require installation of any particular type of passive restraint; instead, it gave manufacturers the option to install automatic seatbelts, airbags, or any other suitable technology that they might develop, provided the restraint(s) met the performance requirements specified in the rule.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alexis Geier drove her 1987 Honda Accord into a tree, and although she was wearing her seatbelt, she nonetheless suffered serious injuries.  She then sued Honda under state tort law, alleging that her car was negligently and defectively designed because it lacked a driver\xe2\x80\x99s-side airbag.  She argued that Congress had empowered the Secretary to set only \xe2\x80\x9cminimum standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for vehicle safety.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391(2).  She also emphasized that the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act contains a saving clause, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71397(k).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the statute\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause, and notwithstanding the fact that Congress gave the Secretary authority to set only \xe2\x80\x9cminimum\xe2\x80\x9d safety standards, we held Geier\xe2\x80\x99s state tort suit pre-empted.  In reaching that result, we relied heavily on the view of the Secretary of Transportation\xe2\x80\x94expressed in an <em>amicus</em> brief\xe2\x80\x94that Standard 208 \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98embodies the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed <em>alternative</em> protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S., at 881 (quoting Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em>,<em> </em>O.\xc2\xa0T. 1999, No. 98\xe2\x80\x931811, p. 25).  Because the Secretary determined that a menu of alternative technologies was \xe2\x80\x9csafe,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctrine of conflict pre-emption barred Geier\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to deem some of those federally approved alternatives \xe2\x80\x9cunsafe\xe2\x80\x9d under state tort law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same rationale applies here.  Through Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label, the FDA offered medical professionals a menu of federally approved, \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d alternatives\xe2\x80\x94including IV push\xe2\x80\x94for administering the drug.  Through a state tort suit, respondent attempted to deem IV push \xe2\x80\x9cunsafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cineffective.\xe2\x80\x9d  To be sure, federal law does not prohibit Wyeth from contraindicating IV push, just as federal law did not prohibit Honda from installing airbags in all its cars.  But just as we held that States may not compel the latter, so, too, are States precluded from compelling the former.  See also<em> Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>De la Cuesta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/141/index.html">458 U.

If anything, a finding of pre-emption is even more appropriate here because the FDCA\xe2\x80\x94unlike the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act\xe2\x80\x94contains no evidence that Congress intended the FDA to set only \xe2\x80\x9cminimum standards,\xe2\x80\x9d and the FDCA does not contain a saving clause.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See also <em>ante</em>, at 18 (conceding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csilence\xe2\x80\x9d on the issue).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its attempt to evade <em>Geier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to this case, the Court commits both factual and legal errors.  First, as a factual matter, it is demonstrably untrue that the FDA failed to consider (and strike a \xe2\x80\x9cbalance\xe2\x80\x9d between) the specific costs and benefits associated with IV push.  Second, as a legal matter, <em>Geier</em> does not stand for the legal propositions espoused by the dissenters (and specifically rejected by the majority) in that case.  Third, drug labeling by jury verdict undermines both our broader pre-emption jurisprudence and the broader workability of the federal drug-labeling regime.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s warning label has been subject to the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s strict regulatory oversight since the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s.  For at least the last 34 years, the FDA has focused specifically on whether IV-push administration of Phenergan is \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffective\xe2\x80\x9d when performed in accordance with Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label.  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate decision\xe2\x80\x94to retain IV push as one means for administering Phenergan, albeit subject to stringent warnings\xe2\x80\x94is reflected in the plain text of Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label (sometimes in boldfaced font and all-capital letters).  And the record contains ample evidence that the FDA specifically considered and reconsidered the strength of Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s IV-push-related warnings in light of new scientific and medical data.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s factual assertions to the contrary are mistaken.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FDA\xe2\x80\x99s focus on IV push as a means of administering Phenergan dates back at least to 1975.  In August of that year, several representatives from both the FDA and Wyeth met to discuss Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s warning label.  At that meeting, the FDA specifically proposed \xe2\x80\x9cthat Phenergan Injection should not be used in Tubex\xc2\xae.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Record 583, 586 (Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s Trial Exh. 17, Internal Correspondence from W.\xc2\xa0E. Langeland to File (Sept. 5, 1975) (hereinafter 1975 Memo)).  \xe2\x80\x9cTubex\xe2\x80\x9d is a syringe system used exclusively for IV push.  See App. 43.  An FDA official explained that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s concerns arose from medical-malpractice lawsuits involving IV push of the drug, see 1975 Memo 586, and that the FDA was aware of \xe2\x80\x9c5 cases involving amputation where the drug had been administered by Tubex together with several additional cases involving necrosis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 586\xe2\x80\x93587.  Rather than contraindicating Phenergan for IV push, however, the agency and Wyeth agreed \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was a need for better instruction regarding the problems of intraarterial injection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 587.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next year, the FDA convened an advisory committee to study, among other things, the risks associated with the Tubex system and IV push.  App. 294.  At the conclusion of its study, the committee recommended an additional IV-push-specific warning for Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label, see <em>ibid.</em>, but did not recommend eliminating IV push from the drug label altogether.  In response to the committee\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations, the FDA instructed Wyeth to make several changes to strengthen Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label, including the addition of upper case warnings related to IV push.  See <em>id.</em>, at 279\xe2\x80\x93280, 282\xe2\x80\x93283.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1987, the FDA directed Wyeth to amend its label to include the following text:  </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[1] When used intravenously, [Phenergan] should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg/ml and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg/minute.

The second of the two quoted sentences refers to IV drip.  See <em>id.</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (emphasizing that a \xe2\x80\x9crunning IV\xe2\x80\x9d is the same thing as \xe2\x80\x9cIV drip\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its 1987 labeling order, the FDA cited voluminous materials to \xe2\x80\x9csuppor[t]\xe2\x80\x9d its new and stronger warnings related to IV push and the preferability of IV drip.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 313.  One of those articles specifically discussed the relative advantages and disadvantages of IV drip compared to IV push, as well as the costs and benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The FDA also cited published case reports from the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s of gangrene caused by the intra-arterial injection of Phenergan,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and the FDA instructed Wyeth to amend Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s label in accordance with the latest medical research.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The FDA also studied drugs similar to Phenergan and cited numerous cautionary articles\xe2\x80\x94one of which urged the agency to consider contraindicating such drugs for IV use altogether.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In \xe2\x80\x9csupport\xe2\x80\x9d of its labeling order, the FDA also cited numerous articles that singled out the inner crook of the elbow\xe2\x80\x94known as the \xe2\x80\x9cantecubital fossa\xe2\x80\x9d in the medical community\xe2\x80\x94which<em> </em>is both a commonly used injection site, see <em>id.</em>, at 70 (noting that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s injection was pushed into \xe2\x80\x9cthe antecubital space\xe2\x80\x9d), and a universally recognized high-risk area for inadvertent intra-arterial injections.  One of the articles explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the numerous superficial positions the ulnar artery might occupy, it has often been entered during attempted venipuncture [of the antecubital fossa]. \xe2\x80\xa6  However, the brachial and the radial arteries might also be quite superficial in the elbow region\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

As we explained in <em>Riegel</em>, juries tend to focus on the risk of a particular product\xe2\x80\x99s design or warning label that arguably contributed to a particular plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury, not on the overall benefits of that design or label; \xe2\x80\x9cthe patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Indeed, patients like respondent are the only ones whom tort juries ever see, and for a patient like respondent\xe2\x80\x94who has already suffered a tragic accident\xe2\x80\x94Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s risks are no longer a matter of probabilities and potentialities.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, the FDA has the benefit of the long view.  Its drug-approval determinations consider the interests of all potential users of a drug, including \xe2\x80\x9cthose who would suffer without new medical [products]\xe2\x80\x9d if juries in all 50 States were free to contradict the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s expert determinations.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 13).  And the FDA conveys its warnings with one voice, rather than whipsawing the medical community with 50 (or more) potentially conflicting ones.  After today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, however, parochialism may prevail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem is well illustrated by the labels borne by \xe2\x80\x9cvesicant\xe2\x80\x9d drugs, many of which are used for chemotherapy.  As a class, vesicants are much more dangerous than drugs like Phenergan,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] but the vast majority of vesicant labels\xe2\x80\x94like Phenergan\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94either allow or do not disallow IV push.  See Appendix, <em>infra</em>.  Because vesicant extravasation can have devastating consequences, and because the potentially lifesaving benefits of these drugs offer hollow solace to the victim of such a tragedy, a jury\xe2\x80\x99s cost-benefit analysis in a particular case may well differ from the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, consider Mustargen (mechlorethamine HCl)\xe2\x80\x94the injectable form of mustard gas\xe2\x80\x94which can be used as an anticancer drug.  Mustargen\xe2\x80\x99s FDA-approved label warns in several places that \xe2\x80\x9c<font b="1">This drug is HIGHLY TOXIC.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Indeed, the drug is so highly toxic:</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cShould accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation.  Should accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water, for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes, followed by 2% sodium thiosulfate solution.  Medical attention should be sought immediately.  Contaminated clothing should be destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">\nYet when it comes to administering this highly toxic drug, the label provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe drug may be injected <em>directly into any suitable vein</em>, [but] it is injected preferably into the rubber or plastic tubing of a flowing intravenous infusion set.  This reduces the possibility of severe local reactions due to extravasation or high concentration of the drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Similarly, the FDA-approved labels for other powerful chemotherapeutic vesicants\xe2\x80\x94including Dactinomycin, Oxaliplatin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine\xe2\x80\x94specifically allow IV push, notwithstanding their devastating effects when extravasated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the labels for such drugs allow IV push is striking\xe2\x80\x94both because vesicants are much more dangerous than Phenergan, and also because they are so frequently extravasated, see Boyle &amp; Engelking, Vesicant Extravasation: Myths and Realities, 22 Oncology Nursing Forum 57, 58 (1995) (arguing that the rate of extravasation is \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderably higher\xe2\x80\x9d than 6.4% of all vesicant administrations).  Regardless of the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for not contraindicating IV push for these drugs, it is odd (to say the least) that a jury in Vermont can now order for Phenergan what the FDA has chosen not to order for mustard gas.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, state tort suits can peacefully coexist with the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s labeling regime, and they have done so for decades.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.
