The warrant authorized installation in the District of Columbia and within 10 days, but agents installed the device on the 11th day and in Maryland.  The Government then tracked the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements for 28 days.  It subsequently secured an indictment of Jones and others on drug trafficking conspiracy charges.  The District Court suppressed the GPS data obtained while the vehicle was parked at Jones\xe2\x80\x99s residence, but held the remaining data admissible because Jones had no reasonable expectation of privacy when the vehicle was on public streets.  Jones was convicted.  The D.\xc2\xa0C.

Later cases, which have deviated from that exclusively property-based approach, have applied the analysis of Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in Katz v. United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347\n, which said that the \n \nFourth Amendment protects a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 360.  Here, the Court need not address the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Jones had no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d because Jones\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.

The Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, but not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test.  See Alderman v. United States, \n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 165\n; Soldal v.

Officers employed various investigative techniques, including visual surveillance of the nightclub, installation of a camera focused on the front door of the club, and a pen register and wiretap covering Jones\xe2\x80\x99s cellular phone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBased in part on information gathered from these sources, in 2005 the Government applied to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a warrant authorizing the use of an electronic tracking device on the Jeep Grand Cherokee registered to Jones\xe2\x80\x99s wife.  A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the de- vice in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but in Maryland,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t agents installed a GPS tracking device on the undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a public parking lot.  Over the next 28 days, the Government used the device to track the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements, and once had to replace the device\xe2\x80\x99s battery when the vehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland.  By means of signals from multiple satellites, the device established the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s location within 50 to 100 feet, and communicated that location by cellular phone to a Government computer.  It relayed more than 2,000 pages of data over the 4-week period.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count indictment charging Jones and several alleged co-conspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841 and 846.  Before trial, Jones filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the GPS device.

It held the remaining data admissible, because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The Government introduced at trial the same GPS-derived locational data admitted in the first trial, which connected Jones to the alleged conspirators\xe2\x80\x99 stash house that contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine, and 1 kilogram of cocaine base.  The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life imprisonment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amend- ment.

United States v. Chadwick, \n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n12 (1977)\n.

We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the \n \nFourth Amendment when it was adopted.  Entick v. Carrington, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C.\xc2\xa0P. 1765), is a \xe2\x80\x9ccase we have described as a \xe2\x80\x98monument of English freedom\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98undoubtedly familiar\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98every American statesman\xe2\x80\x99 at the time the Constitution was adopted, and considered to be \xe2\x80\x98the true and ultimate expression of constitutional law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to search and seizure.  Brower v. County of Inyo, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 593, \n596 (1989)\n (quoting Boyd v. United States, \n\n116 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616, \n626 (1886)\n).  In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain terms the significance of property rights in search-and-seizure analysis:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s close without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s ground, he must justify it by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Entick, supra, at 817.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThe text of the \n \nFourth Amendment reflects its close connection to property, since otherwise it would have referred simply to \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures\xe2\x80\x9d; the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin their persons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d would have been superfluous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with this understanding, our \n \nFourth Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century.  Kyllo v. United States, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27, \n31 (2001)\n; Kerr, The \n \nFourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 801, 816 (2004).  Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, \n\n277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438 (1928)\n, we held that wiretaps attached to telephone wires on the public streets did not constitute a \n \nFourth Amendment search because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 464.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur later cases, of course, have deviated from that exclusively property-based approach.  In Katz v. United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347, \n351 (1967)\n, we said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \n \nFourth Amendment protects people, not places,\xe2\x80\x9d and found a violation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a public telephone booth.  Our later cases have applied the analysis of Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence in that case, which said that a violation occurs when government officers violate a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 360.  See, e.g., Bond v. United States, \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 334 (2000)\n; California v. Ciraolo, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207 (1986)\n; Smith v. Maryland, \n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735 (1979)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government contends that the Harlan standard shows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in the area of the Jeep accessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the locations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were visible to all.  But we need not address the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, because Jones\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.  At bottom, we must \xe2\x80\x9cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the \n \nFourth Amendment was adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kyllo, supra, at 34.  As explained, for most of our history the \n \nFourth Amendment was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (\xe2\x80\x9cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\xe2\x80\x9d) it enumerates.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Katz did not repudiate that understanding.  Less than two years later the Court upheld defendants\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Government could not introduce against them conversations between other people obtained by warrantless placement of electronic surveillance devices in their homes.  The opinion rejected the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that there was no \n \nFourth Amendment violation \xe2\x80\x9cunless the conversational privacy of the homeowner himself is invaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Alderman v. United States, \n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 165, \n176 (1969)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e [do not] believe that Katz, by holding that the \n \nFourth Amendment protects persons and their private conversations, was intended to withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment extends to the home .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 180.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore recently, in Soldal v. Cook County, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56 (1992)\n, the Court unanimously rejected the argument that although a \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d had occurred \xe2\x80\x9cin a \xe2\x80\x98technical\xe2\x80\x99 sense\xe2\x80\x9d when a trailer home was forcibly removed, id., at 62, no \n \nFourth Amendment violation occurred because law enforcement had not \xe2\x80\x9cinvade[d] the [individuals\xe2\x80\x99] privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 60.  Katz, the Court explained, established that \xe2\x80\x9cproperty rights are not the sole measure of \n \nFourth Amendment violations,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not \xe2\x80\x9csnuf[f] out the previously recognized protection for property.\xe2\x80\x9d  506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 64.  As Justice Brennan explained in his concurrence in Knotts, Katz did not erode the principle \xe2\x80\x9cthat, when the Government does engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information, that intrusion may constitute a violation of the \n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 286 (opinion concurring in judgment).  We have embodied that preservation of past rights in our very definition of \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d which we have said to be an expectation \xe2\x80\x9cthat has a source outside of the \n \nFourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minnesota v.

Katz did not narrow the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government contends that several of our post-Katz cases foreclose the conclusion that what occurred here constituted a search.  It relies principally on two cases in which we rejected \n \nFourth Amendment challenges to \xe2\x80\x9cbeepers,\xe2\x80\x9d electronic tracking devices that represent another form of electronic monitoring.  The first case, Knotts, upheld against \n \nFourth Amendment challenge the use of a \xe2\x80\x9cbeeper\xe2\x80\x9d that had been placed in a container of chloroform, allowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the container.  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 278.  We said that there had been no infringement of Knotts\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable expectation of privacy since the information obtained\xe2\x80\x94the location of the automobile carrying the container on public roads, and the location of the off-loaded container in open fields near Knotts\xe2\x80\x99 cabin\xe2\x80\x94had been voluntarily conveyed to the public.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Id., at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  But as we have discussed, the Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test.  The holding in Knotts addressed only the former, since the latter was not at issue.  The beeper had been placed in the container before it came into Knotts\xe2\x80\x99 possession, with the consent of the then-owner.  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 278.  Knotts did not challenge that installation, and we specifically de- clined to consider its effect on the \n \nFourth Amendment analysis.  Id., at 279, n.  Knotts would be relevant, perhaps, if the Government were making the argument that what would otherwise be an unconstitutional search is not such where it produces only public information.  The Government does not make that argument, and we know of no case that would support it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second \xe2\x80\x9cbeeper\xe2\x80\x9d case, United States v. Karo, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 705 (1984)\n, does not suggest a different conclusion.  There we addressed the question left open by Knotts, whether the installation of a beeper in a container amounted to a search or seizure.  468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 713.  As in Knotts, at the time the beeper was installed the container belonged to a third party, and it did not come into possession of the defendant until later.  468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 708.  Thus, the specific question we considered was whether the installation \xe2\x80\x9cwith the consent of the original owner constitute[d] a search or seizure .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when the container is delivered to a buyer having no knowledge of the presence of the beeper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 707 (emphasis added).  We held not.  The Government, we said, came into physical contact with the container only before it belonged to the defendant Karo; and the transfer of the container with the unmonitored beeper inside did not convey any information and thus did not invade Karo\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.  See id., at 712.  That conclusion is perfectly consistent with the one we reach here.  Karo accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and all, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\xe2\x80\x99s presence, even though it was used to monitor the container\xe2\x80\x99s location.  Cf. On Lee v. United States, \n\n343 U.\xc2\xa0S. 747\n\xe2\x80\x93752 (1952) (no search or seizure where an informant, who was wearing a concealed microphone, was invited into the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s business).  Jones, who possessed the Jeep at the time the Government trespassorily inserted the information-gathering device, is on much different footing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government also points to our exposition in New York v. Class, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106 (1986)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he exterior of a car .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine it does not constitute a \xe2\x80\x98search.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 114.  That statement is of marginal relevance here since, as the Government acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers in this case did more than conduct a visual inspection of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 41 (emphasis added).  By attaching the device to the Jeep, officers encroached on a protected area.  In Class itself we suggested that this would make a difference, for we concluded that an officer\xe2\x80\x99s momentary reaching into the interior of a vehicle did constitute a search.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114\xe2\x80\x93115.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position gains little support from our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170 (1984)\n, that officers\xe2\x80\x99 information-gathering intrusion on an \xe2\x80\x9copen field\xe2\x80\x9d did not constitute a \n \nFourth Amendment search even though it was a trespass at common law, id., at 183.  Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of a home, see United States v. Dunn, \n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 294, \n300 (1987)\n, is not one of those protected areas enumerated in the \n \nFourth Amendment.  Oliver, supra, at 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  See also Hester v. United States, \n\n265 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57, \n59 (1924)\n.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s physical intrusion on such an area\xe2\x80\x94unlike its intrusion on the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d at issue here\xe2\x80\x94is of no \n \nFourth Amendment significance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurrence begins by accusing us of applying \xe2\x80\x9c18th-century tort law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 1.  That is a distortion.  What we apply is an 18th-century guarantee against un- reasonable searches, which we believe must provide at a\xc2\xa0minimum the degree of protection it afforded when it was adopted.  The concurrence does not share that belief.  It would apply exclusively Katz\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test, even when that eliminates rights that previously existed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurrence faults our approach for \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[ing] particularly vexing problems\xe2\x80\x9d in cases that do not involve physical contact, such as those that involve the transmission of electronic signals.  Post, at 9.  We entirely fail to understand that point.  For unlike the concurrence, which would make Katz the exclusive test, we do not make trespass the exclusive test.  Situations involving merely the transmission of electronic signals without trespass would remain subject to Katz analysis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fact, it is the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on the exclusivity of the Katz test that needlessly leads us into \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly vexing problems\xe2\x80\x9d in the present case.  This Court has to date not deviated from the understanding that mere visual observation does not constitute a search.  See Kyllo, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  We accordingly held in Knotts that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281.  Thus, even assuming that the concurrence is correct to say that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]raditional surveillance\xe2\x80\x9d of Jones for a 4-week period \xe2\x80\x9cwould have required a large team of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 12, our cases suggest that such visual observation is constitutionally permissible.  It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompany- ing trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd answering it affirmatively leads us needlessly into additional thorny problems.  The concurrence posits that \xe2\x80\x9crelatively short-term monitoring of a person\xe2\x80\x99s movements on public streets\xe2\x80\x9d is okay, but that \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses\xe2\x80\x9d is no good.  Post, at 13 (emphasis added).  That introduces yet another novelty into our jurisprudence.  There is no precedent for the proposition that whether a search has occurred depends on the nature of the crime being investigated.  And even accepting that novelty, it remains unexplained why a 4-week investigation is \xe2\x80\x9csurely\xe2\x80\x9d too long and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving sub- stantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an \xe2\x80\x9cextra- ordinary offens[e]\xe2\x80\x9d which may permit longer observation.  See post, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  What of a 2-day monitoring of a suspected purveyor of stolen electronics?  Or of a 6-month monitoring of a suspected terrorist?  We may have to grapple with these \xe2\x80\x9cvexing problems\xe2\x80\x9d in some future case where a classic trespassory search is not involved and resort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason for rushing forward to resolve them here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues in the alternative that even if the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was reasonable\xe2\x80\x94and thus lawful\xe2\x80\x94under the \n \nFourth Amendment because \xe2\x80\x9cofficers had reasonable suspicion, and in- deed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader in a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 50\xe2\x80\x9351.

Indeed, the success of the surveillance technique that the officers employed was dependent on  the fact that the GPS did not interfere in any way with  the operation of the vehicle, for if any such interference had been detected, the device might have been discovered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court does claim that the installation and use of the GPS constituted a search, see ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, but this con-clusion is dependent on the questionable proposition that these two procedures cannot be separated for purposes of \n \nFourth Amendment analysis.  If these two procedures are analyzed separately, it is not at all clear from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion why either should be regarded as a search.  It is clear that the attachment of the GPS device was not itself a search; if the device had not functioned or if the officers had not used it, no information would have been obtained.  And the Court does not contend that the use of the device constituted a search either.  On the contrary, the Court accepts the holding in United States v. Knotts, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276 (1983)\n, that the use of a surreptitiously planted electronic device to monitor a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements on public roads did not amount to a search.

United States, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27\n,  34 (2001)).  But it is almost impossible to think of late- 18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in this case.  (Is it possible to imagine a case in which a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach and remained there for a period of time in order to monitor the movements of the coach\xe2\x80\x99s owner?\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t)  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory seems to be that the concept of a search, as originally un-derstood, comprehended any technical trespass that led  to the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is in-correct.  At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on private property was actionable, see Prosser &amp; Keeton 75, but a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage\xe2\x80\x9d of a home, does not fall within the scope of the \n \nFourth Amendment because private property outside the curtilage is not part of a \xe2\x80\x9chous[e]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the \n \nFourth Amendment.  See Oliver v. United States, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170 (1984)\n; Hester v. United States, \n\n265 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57 (1924)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in this case is very similar to that in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s early decisions involving wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, namely, that a technical trespass followed by the gathering of evidence constitutes a   search.  In the early electronic surveillance cases, the Court concluded that a \n \nFourth Amendment search occurred when private conversations were monitored as a result of an \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied\xe2\x80\x9d by the defendant.  Silverman v. United States, \n\n365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505, \n509 (1961)\n.  In Silverman, police officers listened to conversations in an attached home by inserting a \xe2\x80\x9cspike mike\xe2\x80\x9d through the wall that this house shared with the vacant house next door.  Id., at 506.  This procedure was held to be a search because the mike made contact with a heating duct on the other side of the wall and thus \xe2\x80\x9cusurp[ed] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an integral part of the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 511.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, in cases in which there was no trespass, it was held that there was no search.  Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, \n\n277 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438 (1928)\n, the Court found that the \n \nFourth Amendment did not apply because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he taps from house lines were made in the streets near the  houses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 457.  Similarly, the Court concluded that no search occurred in Goldman v. United States, \n\n316 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, \n135 (1942)\n, where a \xe2\x80\x9cdetectaphone\xe2\x80\x9d was placed on the outer wall of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s office for the purpose of overhearing conversations held within the room.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis trespass-based rule was repeatedly criticized.  In Olmstead, Justice Brandeis wrote that it was \xe2\x80\x9cimmaterial where the physical connection with the telephone wires was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  277 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 479 (dissenting opinion).  Al-though a private conversation transmitted by wire did not fall within the literal words of the \n \nFourth Amendment, he argued, the Amendment should be understood as prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cevery unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 478.

United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967)\n, finally did away with the old approach, holding that a trespass was not required for a \n \nFourth Amendment violation.  Katz in-volved the use of a listening device that was attached to the outside of a public telephone booth and that allowed police officers to eavesdrop on one end of the target\xe2\x80\x99s phone conversation.  This procedure did not physically intrude on the area occupied by the target, but the Katz Court, \xe2\x80\x9crepudiate[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the old doctrine, Rakas v. Illinois, \n\n439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, \n143 (1978)\n, and held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fact that the electronic device employed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance,\xe2\x80\x9d 389 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 353 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he reach of th[e] [Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure\xe2\x80\x9d); see Rakas, supra, at 143 (describing Katz as holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cca-pacity to claim the protection for the \n \nFourth Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place but upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place\xe2\x80\x9d); Kyllo, supra, at 32 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have since decoupled violation of a person\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFourth Amendment rights  from trespassory violation of his property\xe2\x80\x9d).

See 394 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 176\xe2\x80\x93180.  Alderman is best understood to mean that the homeowners had a legitimate expectation of privacy in all conversations that took place under their roof.

First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning largely disregards what is really important (the use of a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead attaches great significance to something that most would view as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a small, light object that does not interfere in any way with the car\xe2\x80\x99s operation).  Attaching such an object is generally regarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for recovery under modern tort law.  See Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa714, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal property not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000) (same).  But under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, this conduct may violate the \n \nFourth Amendment.  By contrast, if long-term monitoring can be accomplished without committing a technical trespass\xe2\x80\x94suppose, for example, that the Federal Government required or persuaded auto manufacturers to include a GPS tracking device in every car\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory would provide no protection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach leads to incongruous results.   If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use the device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory, the \n \nFourth Amendment applies.  But if the police follow the same car for a much longer period using unmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not subject to any \n \nFourth Amendment constraints.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the present case, the \n \nFourth Amendment applies, the Court concludes, because the officers installed the GPS device after respondent\xe2\x80\x99s wife, to whom the car was registered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use.  See ante, at 8.  But if the GPS had been attached prior to that time, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory would lead to a different result.  The Court proceeds on the assumption that respondent \xe2\x80\x9chad at least the property rights of a bailee,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to chattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the bailment.  See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment \xc2\xa7166, pp.\xc2\xa0685\xe2\x80\x93686 (2009).  So if the GPS device had been installed before respondent\xe2\x80\x99s wife gave him the keys, respondent would have no claim for trespass\xe2\x80\x94and, presumably, no \n \nFourth Amendment claim either.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory, the coverage of the \n \nFourth Amendment may vary from State to State.  If the events at issue here had occurred in a community property State\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital   Property Act,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t respondent would likely be an owner of  the vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was installed before or after his wife turned over the keys.  In non-community-property States, on the other hand, the registration of the vehicle in the name of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s wife would generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that she was the sole owner.  See 60 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Motor Vehicles \xc2\xa7231, pp.\xc2\xa0398\xe2\x80\x93399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles \xc2\xa71208, pp.\xc2\xa0859\xe2\x80\x93860 (2007).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the law of trespass will present particularly vexing problems in cases involving surveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as opposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.  For example, suppose that the officers in the present case had followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a stolen vehicle detection system that came with the car when it was purchased.  Would the sending of a radio signal to activate this system constitute a trespass to chattels?  Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a physical touching of the property.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964); Dobbs, supra, at 123.  In recent years, courts have wrestled with the application of this old tort in cases involving unwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and some have held that even the transmission of electrons that occurs when a communication is sent from one computer to another is enough.  See, e.g., CompuServe, Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc. 962 F. Supp. 1015, 1021 (SD Ohio 1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559, 1566, n. 6 (1996).  But may such decisions be followed in applying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s trespass theory?  Assuming that what matters under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory is the law of trespass as it existed at the time of the adoption of the \n \nFourth   Amendment, do these recent decisions represent a change in the law or simply the application of the old tort to new situations?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Katz expectation-of-privacy test avoids the problems and complications noted above, but it is not without its own difficulties.  It involves a degree of circularity, see Kyllo, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 34, and judges are apt to confuse their own expectations of privacy with those of the hypothetical reasonable person to which the Katz test looks.  See  Minnesota v. Carter, \n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83, \n97 (1998)\n (Scalia, J., concurring).  In addition, the Katz test rests on the assumption that this hypothetical reasonable person has a well-developed and stable set of privacy expectations.  But technology can change those expectations.  Dramatic technological change may lead to periods in which popular expectations are in flux and may ultimately produce significant changes in popular attitudes.  New technology may provide increased convenience or security at the expense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff worthwhile.  And even if the public does not welcome  the diminution of privacy that new technology entails, they may eventually reconcile themselves to this development as inevitable.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, concern about new intrusions on privacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect against these intrusions.  This is what ultimately happened with respect to wiretapping.  After Katz, Congress   did not leave it to the courts to develop a body of \n \nFourth Amendment case law governing that complex subject.  Instead, Congress promptly enacted a comprehensive statute, see 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72510\xe2\x80\x932522 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), and since that time, the regulation of wiretapping has been governed primarily by statute and not by case law.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In an ironic sense, although Katz overruled Olmstead, Chief Justice Taft\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion in the latter case that the regulation of wiretapping was a matter better left for Congress, see 277 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 465\xe2\x80\x93466, has been borne out.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRecent years have seen the emergence of many new devices that permit the monitoring of a person\xe2\x80\x99s movements.  In some locales, closed-circuit television video monitoring is becoming ubiquitous.  On toll roads, automatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the movements of motorists who choose to make use of  that convenience.  Many motorists purchase cars that are equipped with devices that permit a central station to ascertain the car\xe2\x80\x99s location at any time so that roadside assistance may be provided if needed and the car may be found if it is stolen.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps most significant, cell phones and other wireless devices now permit wireless carriers to track and record the location of users\xe2\x80\x94and as of June 2011, it has been reported, there were more than 322 million wireless devices in use in the United States.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  For older phones, the accuracy of the location information depends on the den-sity of the tower network, but new \xe2\x80\x9csmart phones,\xe2\x80\x9d which   are equipped with a GPS device, permit more precise tracking.  For example, when a user activates the GPS on such a phone, a provider is able to monitor the phone\xe2\x80\x99s location and speed of movement and can then report back real-time traffic conditions after combining (\xe2\x80\x9ccrowdsourcing\xe2\x80\x9d) the speed of all such phones on any particular road.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Similarly, phone-location-tracking services are offered as \xe2\x80\x9csocial\xe2\x80\x9d tools, allowing consumers to find (or to avoid) others who enroll in these services.  The availability and use of these and other new devices will continue to shape the average person\xe2\x80\x99s expectations about the privacy of his or her daily movements.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the pre-computer age, the greatest protections of privacy were neither constitutional nor statutory, but practical.  Traditional surveillance for any extended period of time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely undertaken. The surveillance at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94constant monitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks\xe2\x80\x94would have required a large team of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Only an investigation of unusual importance could have justified such an   expenditure of law enforcement resources.  Devices like the one used in the present case, however, make long-term monitoring relatively easy and cheap.  In circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102 Mich. L. Rev., at 805\xe2\x80\x93806.  A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo date, however, Congress and most States have not enacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking technology for law enforcement purposes.  The best that we can do in this case is to apply existing \n \nFourth Amendment doctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a particular case involved a degree of intrusion that a reasonable person would not have anticipated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder this approach, relatively short-term monitoring of a person\xe2\x80\x99s movements on public streets accords with expectations of privacy that our society has recognized  as reasonable.  See Knotts, 460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  But  the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy.  For such offenses, society\xe2\x80\x99s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, in the main, simply could not\xe2\x80\x94secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s car for  a very long period.  In this case, for four weeks, law enforcement agents tracked every movement that respondent made in the vehicle he was driving.  We need not identify with precision the point at which the tracking of this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely crossed before the 4-week mark.  Other cases may present more difficult questions.  But where uncertainty exists with respect to whether a certain period of GPS surveil   lance is long enough to constitute a \n \nFourth Amendment search, the police may always seek a warrant.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  We also need not consider whether prolonged GPS monitoring in the context of investigations involving extraordinary offenses would similarly intrude on a constitutionally protected sphere of privacy.  In such cases, long-term tracking might have been mounted using previously available techniques.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitoring that occurred in this case constituted a search under the \n \nFourth Amendment.  I therefore agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be  affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Although the record does not reveal the size or weight of the device used in this case, there is now a device in use that weighs two ounces and is the size of a credit card.
