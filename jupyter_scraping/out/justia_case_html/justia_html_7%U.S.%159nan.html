S. 172</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>This is an indictment against the defendant for taking fees under color of his office, as a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>A doubt has been suggested respecting the jurisdiction of this Court in appeals on writs of error from the judgments of the circuit court for that district in criminal cases, and this question is to be decided before the Court can inquire into the merits of the case.</p>\n<p>In support of the jurisdiction of the Court, the Attorney General has adverted to the words of the Constitution, from which he seemed to argue that as criminal jurisdiction was exercised by the courts of the United States, under the description of, "all cases in law and equity arising under the laws of the United States," and as the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, was extended to all enumerated cases, other than those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 7 U. S. 173</a></p><p> which might be brought on originally, "with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the Congress shall make," that the Supreme Court possessed appellate jurisdiction in criminal as well as civil cases over the judgments of every court whose decisions it would review unless there should be some exception or regulation made by Congress which should circumscribe the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>This argument would be unanswerable if the Supreme Court had been created by law without describing its jurisdiction.  The Constitution would then have been the only standard by which its powers could be tested, since there would be clearly no congressional regulation or exception on the subject.</p>\n<p>But as the jurisdiction of the Court has been described, it has been regulated by Congress, and an affirmative description of its powers must be understood as a regulation, under the Constitution, prohibiting the exercise of other powers than those described.</p>\n<p>Thus the appellate jurisdiction of this Court from the judgments of the circuit courts is described affirmatively.  No restrictive words are used.  Yet it has never been supposed that a decision of a circuit court could be reviewed unless the matter in dispute should exceed the value of $2,000.  There are no words in the act restraining the Supreme Court from taking cognizance of causes under that sum; their jurisdiction is only limited by the legislative declaration that they may reexamine the decisions of the circuit court where the matter in dispute exceeds the value of $2,000.</p>\n<p>This Court therefore will only review those judgments of the Circuit Court of Columbia, a power to reexamine which is expressly given by law.</p>\n<p>On examining the act "concerning the District of Columbia," the Court is of opinion that the appellate jurisdiction granted by that act is confined to civil cases.  The words, "matter in dispute," seem appropriated to civil cases, where the subject in contest has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 7 U. S. 174</a></p><p> a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act.  But in criminal cases the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused.  And although he may be fined upwards of $100, yet that is, in the eye of the law, a punishment for the offense committed, and not the particular object of the suit.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of error therefore is to be dismissed, this Court having no jurisdiction of the case.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
