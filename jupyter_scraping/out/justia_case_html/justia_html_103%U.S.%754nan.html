Separate and distinct interests were not united in the suit.  The service rendered was the joint service of all the salvors, and the recovery was on that account.  It was a matter of no consequence to the owners of the property saved how the money recovered was apportioned among those who had earned it.  The owners were decreed to pay the salvors for what they, acting together in a common service, had done.  In such a suit, we think the owners cannot be deprived of their appeal because the court below, in the further progress of the cause, saw fit to apportion the recovery among the salvors according to their respective merits.  The decree is, in legal effect, one decree in favor of all the salvors, they having, as between themselves, unequal interests.</p>\n<p>In all the cases where we have held that several sums decreed in favor of or against different persons could not be united to give us jurisdiction on appeal, it will be found that the matters in dispute were entirely separate and distinct, and were joined in one suit for convenience and to save expense.
