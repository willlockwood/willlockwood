Okay, but . . . the swaying fact was that this was two sworn officers of the law rather than anything they told you in these Underlying Facts and Circumstances?</ul> <ul>"A. That\'s right. They were officers of the Narcotics."</ul> <p> The trial court rejected petitioner\'s arguments and admitted the evidence. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner\'s conviction, holding both that the warrant was supported by probable cause and that the conduct of the judge who signed the warrant, although not a model of judicial deportment, had satisfied the constitutional requirements of detachment and neutrality. 467 So.2d 940 (1985). </p><p> Respondent argues before this Court that even if the judge failed to evaluate the request for the warrant in a neutral and detached fashion, the warrant was nonetheless valid because it was, in fact, supported by probable cause.* This attempt to evade review of the judge\'s lack of independence should not succeed. In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="987">Page 474 U.S. 984 , 987</a></p><p> Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S., at 450-451-2030, we firmly rejected the argument that "the existence of probable cause renders noncompliance with the warrant procedure an irrelevance." Indeed, in Coolidge the Court declared that because the warrant was not issued by " the neutral and detached magistrate required by the Constitution, the search stands on no firmer ground than if there had been no warrant at all ." Id., at 453. </p><p> As the transcript of the suppression hearing clearly demonstrates, the judge who issued the warrant to search petitioner\'s automobile, although formally separate from law enforcement officials, viewed himself as a facilitator of police investigations and simply acquiesced in police requests, without giving serious and independent consideration to the facts set forth in supporting affidavits. The Court\'s failure to grant certiorari in this case suggests that our admonitions that probable cause must be determined by a neutral and detached magistrate are hollow pronouncements. </p><p> I find the Court\'s refusal to take this case particularly disturbing in light of the good faith exception to the Fourth-Amendment exclusionary rule created by United States v. Leon, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html">468 U.S. 897</a>, 82 L. Ed.2d 677 (1984). In Leon, the Court held that physical evidence seized by police officers reasonably relying upon a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate is admissible in the prosecution\'s case in chief, even though a reviewing court has subsequently determined that the warrant was defective or that the officers failed to demonstrate when applying for the warrant that there was probable cause to conduct the search. The Court justified its holding to a large extent on the special protective role that a neutral and detached magistrate plays in safeguarding the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, id., at 913-917-3419. In fact, the Court indicated that suppression of evidence is appropriate where "the magistrate [has] abandoned his detached and neutral role," id., at 926. In my dissent, I warned that creation of a good-faith exception implicitly tells magistrates that they need not take much care in reviewing warrant applications, since their mistakes will have virtually no consequence, id., at 956. Today the Court tacitly informs magistrates that not only need they not worry about mistakes, they also need no longer be neutral and detached in their review of supporting affidavits. The combined message of Leon and the Court\'s refusal to grant certiorari in this case is that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="988">Page 474 U.S. 984 , 988</a></p><p> police may rely on the magistrates and the magistrates may rely on the police. On whom may citizens rely to protect their Fourth Amendment rights? </p><p> I would grant certiorari and summarily reverse, or at least set the case for oral argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Relying on Carroll v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/267/132/case.html">267 U.S. 132</a> (1925), Chambers v. Maroney, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/42/case.html">399 U.S. 42</a>d 419 (1970), and Texas v. White, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/67/case.html">423 U.S. 67</a> (1975), respondent also argues that the instant case involves an automobile search that is supported by probable cause and thus no search warrant was required. Apart from my view that automobile searches presenting no exigent circumstances should be fully subject to the Fourth Amendment\'s warrant requirement, see, e.g., United States v.
