The agency ultimately awarded Wood past-due benefits, withheld 25% of those benefits to pay any attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and awarded Culbertson fees under \xc2\xa7406(a) for representation before the agency.  Culbertson then moved for a separate fee award under \xc2\xa7406(b) for the court proceedings, requesting a full 25% of past-due benefits.  The District Court granted the request, but only in part, because Culbertson did not subtract the amount he had already received under \xc2\xa7406(a) for his agency-level representation.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the 25% limit under \xc2\xa7406(b) applies to the total fees awarded under both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7406(a) and (b).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Section 406(b)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s 25% cap applies only to fees for court representation and not to the aggregate fees awarded under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7406(a) and (b).

Here, the adjective \xe2\x80\x9csuch,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f the kind or degree already described or implied,\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the only form of representation \xe2\x80\x9calready described\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7406(b)\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ation] before the court.\xe2\x80\x9d   Thus, the 25% cap applies only to fees for representation before the court, not the agency.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Subsections (a) and (b) address different stages of the representation and use different methods for calculating fees.  Given this statutory structure, applying \xc2\xa7406(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 25% cap on court-stage fees to \xc2\xa7406(a) agency-stage fees, or the aggregate of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7406(a) and (b) fees, would make little sense.  For example, such a reading would subject \xc2\xa7406(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness limitation to \xc2\xa7406(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 25% cap\xe2\x80\x94a limitation not included in the relevant provision of the statute.

The agency\xe2\x80\x99s choice to withhold only one pool of 25% of past-due benefits does not alter this text.

Here, the only form of representation \xe2\x80\x9calready described\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7406(b) is \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ation] before the court by an attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the 25% cap applies only to fees for representation before the court, not the agency.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This interpretation is supported by \xe2\x80\x9cthe structure of the statute and its other provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maracich</i> v. <i>Spears</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 48, 60 (2013).  As an initial matter, subsections (a) and (b) address different stages of the representation.  Section 406(a) addresses fees for representation \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the Commissioner,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas \xc2\xa7406(b) addresses fees for representation in court.  Because some claimants will prevail before the agency and have no need to bring a court action, it is unsurprising that the statute contemplates separate fees for each stage of representation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These subsections also calculate fees differently.  Section 406(b) applies a flat 25% cap on fees for court representation.  By contrast, \xc2\xa7406(a) provides two ways to determine fees for agency proceedings.  Subsection (a)(2) caps fees based on a fee agreement at the lesser of 25% of past-due benefits or $6,000.  <i>Supra,</i> at 2.

Many claimants will never litigate in court, yet under the aggregate reading, agency fees would be capped at 25% based on a provision related exclusively to representation in court.  Absent a fee agreement, \xc2\xa7406(a)(1) subjects agency fees only to a reasonableness limitation, so applying \xc2\xa7406(b)\xe2\x80\x99s cap to such fees would add a limitation that Congress did not include in the relevant provision of the statute.  If Congress had wanted these fees to be capped at 25%, it presumably would have said so directly in subsection (a), instead of providing for a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable fee\xe2\x80\x9d in that subsection and adding a 25% cap in \xc2\xa7406(b) without even referencing subsection (a).  Thus, the structure of the statute confirms that \xc2\xa7406(b) caps only court representation fees.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Amicus</i> Amy Weil agrees that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7406(a) and \xc2\xa7406(b) provide separate avenues for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for representation of a Social Security claimant,\xe2\x80\x9d but emphasizes that \xe2\x80\x9cthese fees are certified for payment out of a single source: the 25% of past-due benefits withheld by the Commissioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Court-Appointed <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.  According to <i>Amicus</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause the Commissioner withholds only one pool of 25% of past-due benefits from which to pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for both agency and court representation, for an attorney to collect a fee that exceeds the 25% pool of withheld disability benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d the attorney may \xe2\x80\x9cneed to file a lawsuit against his disabled client\xe2\x80\x9d to collect the difference.  <i>Id.,</i> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  Therefore, <i>Amicus</i> urges, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the statute is read as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit is evident that Congress placed a cumulative 25% cap on attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees payable for successful representation of a Social Security claimant before both the agency and the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amicus</i> is quite right that presently the agency withholds a single pool of 25% of past-due benefits for direct payment of agency and court fees.  See Social Security Administration, Program Operations Manual System (POMS), GN\xc2\xa003920.035(A), online at https://policy.ssa.gov/ poms.nsf/lnx/0203920035 (as last visited Jan. 2, 2019); see also 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.1730(a) and (b)(1)(i).  And <i>Amicus</i> sensibly argues that if there is only a single 25% pool for direct payment of fees, Congress might not have intended aggregate fees higher than 25%.  This argument is plausible, but the statutory text in fact provides for two pools of money for direct payment of fees.  Any shortage of withheld benefits for direct payment of fees is thus due to agency policy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under \xc2\xa7406(a)(4), the agency \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d certify for direct payment of agency representation fees \xe2\x80\x9can amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as does not exceed 25 percent of\xe2\x80\x9d past-due benefits.  In other words, this subsection requires that the agency withhold the approved fees for work performed in agency proceedings, up to 25% of the amount of the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s past-due benefits.  But this is not the only subsection that enables the agency to withhold past-due benefits for direct payment of fees.  Section 406(b)(1)(A) provides that the agency \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d certify past-due benefits for direct payment of court representation fees.  As the Government explains, the agency has nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9cexercised its discretion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to withhold a total of 25% of past-due benefits for direct payment of the approved agency <i>and</i> court fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Respondent 8 (emphasis added).  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s choice to withhold only one pool of 25% of past-due benefits does not alter the statutory text, which differentiates between agency representation in \xc2\xa7406(a) and court representation in \xc2\xa7406(b), contains separate caps on fees for each type of representation, and authorizes two pools of withheld benefits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More fundamentally, the amount of past-due benefits that the agency can withhold for direct payment does not delimit the amount of fees that can be approved for representation before the agency or the court.  The attorney might receive a direct payment out of past-due benefits, but that payment could be less than the fees to which the attorney is entitled.  Indeed, prior to 1968, the statute allowed fees for agency representation but lacked a provision for direct payment of such fees from past-due benefits.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And under the current \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7406(a)(1) and (4), the agency can award a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable fee\xe2\x80\x9d that exceeds the 25% of past-due benefits it can withhold for direct payment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, despite the force of <i>Amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, the statute does not bear her reading.  Any concerns about a shortage of withheld benefits for direct payment and the consequences of such a shortage are best addressed to the agency, Congress, or the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s good judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the 25% cap in \xc2\xa7406(b)(1)(A) applies only to fees for court representation, and not to the aggregate fees awarded under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7406(a) and (b), the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">*\xc2\xa0See <i>Bonner</i> v. <i>Prichard</i>, 661 F.\xc2\xa02d 1206, 1209 (CA11 1981) (en banc) (adopting all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit announced prior to October 1, 1981, as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit). </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
