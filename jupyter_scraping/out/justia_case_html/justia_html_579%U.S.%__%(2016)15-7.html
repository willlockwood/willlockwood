She had an adverse reaction to a medication that a purported doctor at Arbour prescribed after diagnosing her with bipolar disorder.  Her condition worsened, and she eventually died of a seizure.  Respondents, her mother and stepfather, later discovered that few Arbour employees were actually licensed to provide mental health counseling or authorized to prescribe medications or offer counseling services without supervision.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents filed a <i>qui tam</i> suit, alleging that Universal Health had violated the False Claims Act (FCA).  That Act imposes significant penalties on anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly presents .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government,\n\n31 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73729(a)(1)(A).  Respondents sought to hold Universal Health liable under what is commonly referred to as an \xe2\x80\x9cimplied false certification theory of liability,\xe2\x80\x9d which treats a payment request as a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s implied certification of compliance with relevant statutes, regulations, or contract requirements that are material conditions of payment and treats a failure to disclose a violation as a misrepresentation that renders the claim \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Specifically, respondents alleged, Universal Health (acting through Arbour) defrauded the Medicaid program by submitting reimbursement claims that made representations about the specific services provided by specific types of professionals, but that failed to disclose serious violations of Massachusetts Medicaid regulations pertaining to staff qualifications and licensing requirements for these services.  Universal Health thus allegedly defrauded the program because Universal Health knowingly misrepresented its compliance with mental health facility requirements that are so central to the provision of mental health counseling that the Medicaid program would have refused to pay these claims had it known of these violations.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The District Court granted Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  It held that respondents had failed to state a claim under the \xe2\x80\x9cimplied false certification\xe2\x80\x9d theory of liability because none of the regulations violated by Arbour was a condition of payment.  The First Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that every submission of a claim implicitly represents compliance with relevant regulations, and that any undisclosed violation of a precondition of payment (whether or not expressly identified as such) renders a claim \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent.\xe2\x80\x9d  The First Circuit further held that the regulations themselves provided conclusive evidence that compliance was a material condition of payment because the regulations expressly required facilities to adequately supervise staff as a condition of payment.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The implied false certification theory can be a basis for FCA liability when a defendant submitting a claim makes specific representations about the goods or services provided, but fails to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements that make those representations misleading with respect to those goods or services.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The FCA does not define a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulent\xe2\x80\x9d claim, so the Court turns to the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cabsent other indication, \xe2\x80\x98Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sekhar</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Under the common-law definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d the parties agree, certain misrepresentations by omission can give rise to FCA liability.  Respondents and the Government contend that every claim for payment implicitly represents that the claimant is legally entitled to payment, and that failing to disclose violations of material legal requirements renders the claim misleading.  Universal Health, on the other hand, argues that submitting a claim involves no representations and that the nondisclosure of legal violations is not actionable absent a special duty of reasonable care to disclose such matters.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision holds that the claims at issue may be actionable because they do more than merely demand payment; they fall squarely within the rule that representations that state the truth only so far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying information, can be actionable misrepresentations.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0By submitting claims for payment using payment codes corresponding to specific counseling services, Universal Health represented that it had provided specific types of treatment.  And Arbour staff allegedly made further representations by using National Provider Identification numbers corresponding to specific job titles.  By conveying this information without disclosing Arbour\xe2\x80\x99s many violations of basic staff and licensing requirements for mental health facilities, Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s claims constituted misrepresentations.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Contrary to Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, FCA liability for failing to disclose violations of legal requirements does not turn upon whether those requirements were expressly designated as conditions of payment.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Section 3729(a)(1)(A), which imposes liability on those presenting \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent claim[s],\xe2\x80\x9d does not limit claims to misrepresentations about express conditions of payment.  Nothing in the text supports such a restriction.  And under the Act\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements are not automatically material, even if they are labeled conditions of payment.  Nor is the restriction supported by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scienter requirement.  A defendant can have \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that a condition is material even if the Government does not expressly call it a condition of payment.  What matters is not the label that the Government attaches to a requirement, but whether the defendant knowingly violated a requirement that the defendant knows is material to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s payment decision.  Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments are unavailing, and are amply addressed through strict enforcement of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s stringent materiality and scienter provisions.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0A misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s payment decision in order to be actionable under the FCA.  The FCA\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement is demanding.  An undisclosed fact is material if, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o one can say with reason that the plaintiff would have signed this contract if informed of the likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of the undisclosed fact.  <i>Junius Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Cohen</i>, 257 N. Y. 393, 400, 178 N. E. 672, 674.  When evaluating the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to expressly identify a provision as a condition of payment is relevant, but not automatically dispositive.  A misrepresentation cannot be deemed material merely because the Government designates compliance with a particular requirement as a condition of payment.  Nor is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s option to decline to pay if it knew of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s noncompliance sufficient for a finding of materiality.  Materiality also cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.  Moreover, if the Government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not material.  The FCA thus does not support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s and First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s expansive view that any statutory, regulatory, or contractual violation is material so long as the defendant knows that the Government would be entitled to refuse payment were it aware of the violation.

Specifically, liability can attach when the defendant submits a claim for payment that makes specific representations about the goods or services provided, but knowingly fails to disclose the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement.  In these circumstances, liability may attach if the omission renders those representations misleading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We further hold that False Claims Act liability for failing to disclose violations of legal requirements does not turn upon whether those requirements were expressly designated as conditions of payment.  Defendants can be liable for violating requirements even if they were not expressly designated as conditions of payment.  Conversely, even when a requirement is expressly designated acondition of payment, not every violation of such a requirement gives rise to liability.

For five years, Yarushka Rivera, a teenage beneficiary of Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 Medicaid program, received counseling services at Arbour Counseling Services, a satellite mental health facility in Lawrence, Massa-chusetts, owned and operated by a subsidiary of peti-tioner Universal Health Services.  Beginning in 2004, when Yarushka started having behavioral problems, five medical professionals at Arbour intermittently treated her.  In May 2009, Yarushka had an adverse reaction to a medication that a purported doctor at Arbour prescribed after diagnosing her with bipolar disorder.  Her condition worsened; she suffered a seizure that required hospitalization.  In October 2009, she suffered another seizure and died.  She was 17 years old.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thereafter, an Arbour counselor revealed to respondents Carmen Correa and Julio Escobar\xe2\x80\x94Yarushka\xe2\x80\x99s mother and stepfather\xe2\x80\x94that few Arbour employees were actually licensed to provide mental health counseling and that supervision of them was minimal.  Respondents discovered that, of the five professionals who had treated Yarushka, only one was properly licensed.  The practitioner who diagnosed Yarushka as bipolar identified herself as a psychologist with a Ph. D., but failed to mention that her degree came from an unaccredited Internet college and that Massachusetts had rejected her application to be licensed as a psychologist.  Likewise, the practitioner who prescribed medicine to Yarushka, and who was held out as a psychiatrist, was in fact a nurse who lacked authority to prescribe medications absent supervision.  Rather than ensuring supervision of unlicensed staff, the clinic\xe2\x80\x99s director helped to misrepresent the staff\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications.  And the problem went beyond those who treated Yarushka.  Some 23 Arbour employees lacked licenses to provide mental health services, yet\xe2\x80\x94despite regulatory requirements to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94they counseled patients and prescribed drugs without supervision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>When submitting reimbursement claims, Arbour used payment codes corresponding to different services that its staff provided to Yaruskha, such as \xe2\x80\x9cIndividual Therapy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfamily therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 App. 19, 20.  Staff members also misrepresented their qualifications and licensing status to the Federal Government to obtain individual National Provider Identification numbers, which are submitted in connection with Medicaid reimbursement claims and correspond to specific job titles.  For instance, one Arbour staff member who treated Yaruskha registered for a number associated with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Social Worker, Clinical,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d despite lacking the credentials and licensing required for social workers engaged in mental health counseling.  1 <i>id.,</i> at 32.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After researching Arbour\xe2\x80\x99s operations, respondents filed complaints with various Massachusetts agencies.  Massachusetts investigated and ultimately issued a report detailing Arbour\xe2\x80\x99s violation of over a dozen Massachusetts Medicaid regulations governing the qualifications and supervision required for staff at mental health facili-ties.  Arbour agreed to a remedial plan, and two Arbour employees also entered into consent agreements with Massachusetts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2011, respondents filed a <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam </i>suit in federal court, see\n\n31 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730, alleging that Universal Health had violated the False Claims Act under an implied false certification theory of liability.  The operative complaint asserts that Universal Health (acting through Arbour) submitted reimbursement claims that made representations about the specific services provided by specific types of professionals, but that failed to disclose serious violations of regulations pertaining to staff qualifications and licensing requirements for these services.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Specifically, the Massachusetts Medicaid program requires satellite facilities to have specific types of clinicians on staff, delineates licensing requirements for particular positions (like psychiatrists, social workers, and nurses), and details supervision requirements for other staff.  See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7429.422\xe2\x80\x93424, 429.439 (2014).  Universal Health allegedly flouted these regulations because Arbour employed unqualified, unlicensed, and unsupervised staff.  The Massachusetts Medicaid program, unaware of these deficiencies, paid the claims.  Universal Health thus allegedly defrauded the program, which would not have reimbursed the claims had it known that it was billed for mental health services that were performed by unlicensed and unsupervised staff.  The United States declined to intervene.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court granted Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the complaint.  Circuit precedent had previously embraced the implied false certification theory of liability.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States ex rel. Hutcheson</i> v. <i>Blackstone Medical, Inc.</i>, 647 F.\xc2\xa03d 377, 385\xe2\x80\x93387 (CA1 2011).<i> </i> But the District Court held that respondents had failed to state a claim under that theory because, with one exception not relevant here, none of the regulations that Arbour violated was a condition of payment.  See 2014 WL 1271757, *1, *6\xe2\x80\x93*12 (D Mass., Mar. 26, 2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed in relevant part and remanded.  780 F.\xc2\xa03d 504, 517 (2015).

To determine whether a claim is \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent\xe2\x80\x9d based on such implicit communications, the court explained, it \xe2\x80\x9casks simply whether the defendant, in submitting a claim for reimbursement, knowingly misrepresented compliance with a material precondition of payment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 512.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement can be a condition of payment either by expressly identifying itself as such or by implication.  <i>Id.,</i> at 512\xe2\x80\x93513.  The court then held that Universal Health had violated Massachusetts Medicaid regulations that \xe2\x80\x9cclearly impose conditions of payment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 513.  The court further held that the regulations themselves \xe2\x80\x9cconstitute[d] dispositive evidence of materiality,\xe2\x80\x9d because they identified adequate supervision as an \xe2\x80\x9cexpress and absolute\xe2\x80\x9d condition of payment and \xe2\x80\x9crepeated[ly] reference[d]\xe2\x80\x9d supervision.  <i>Id.</i>, at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted).</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals over the validity and scope of the implied false certification theory of liability.  577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).

When, as here, a defendant makes representations in submitting a claim but omits its violations of statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements, those omissions can be a basis for liability if they render the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s representations misleading with respect to the goods or services provided.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>To reach this conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e start, as always, with the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allison Engine Co.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel.

They contend that every submission of a claim for payment implicitly represents that the claimant is legally entitled to payment, and that failing to disclose violations of material legal requirements renders the claim misleading.  Universal Health, on the other hand, argues that submitting a claim involves no representations, and that a different common-law rule thus governs: nondisclosure of legal violations is not actionable absent a special \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98duty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to exercise reasonable care to disclose the matter in question,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which it says is lacking in Government contracting.  Brief for Petitioner 31 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7551(1), at 119).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We need not resolve whether all claims for payment implicitly represent that the billing party is legally entitled to payment.  The claims in this case do more than merely demand payment.  They fall squarely within the rule that half-truths\xe2\x80\x94representations that state the truth only so far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying information\xe2\x80\x94can be actionable misrepresentations.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  A classic example of an actionable half-truth in contract law is the seller who reveals that there may be two new roads near a property he is selling, but fails to disclose that a third potential road might bisect the property.  See <i>Junius Constr.

See 3 D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, &amp; H.

Moreover, Arbour staff members allegedly made further representations in submitting Medicaid reimbursement claims by using National Provider Identification numbers corresponding to specific job titles.  And these representations were clearly misleading in context.  Anyone informed that a social worker at a Massachusetts mental health clinic provided a teenage patient with individual counseling services would probably\xe2\x80\x94but wrongly\xe2\x80\x94conclude that the clinic had complied with core Massachusetts Medicaid requirements (1) that a counselor \xe2\x80\x9ctreating children [is] required to have specialized training and experience in children\xe2\x80\x99s services,\xe2\x80\x9d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \xc2\xa7429.422, and also (2) that, at a minimum, the social worker possesses the prescribed qualifications for the job, \xc2\xa7429.424(C).  By using payment and other codes that conveyed this information without disclosing Arbour\xe2\x80\x99s many violations of basic staff and licensing requirements for mental health facilities, Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s claims constituted misrepresentations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accordingly, we hold that the implied certification theory can be a basis for liability, at least where two conditions are satisfied: first, the claim does not merely request payment, but also makes specific representations about the goods or services provided; and second, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements makes those representations misleading half-truths.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><b>The second question presented is whether, as Universal Health urges, a defendant should face False Claims Act liability only if it fails to disclose the violation of a contractual, statutory, or regulatory provision that the Government expressly designated a condition of payment.  We conclude that the Act does not impose this limit on liability.  But we also conclude that not every undisclosed violation of an express condition of payment automatically triggers liability.  Whether a provision is labeled a condition of payment is relevant to but not dispositive of the materiality inquiry.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nothing in the text of the False Claims Act sup-ports Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s proposed restriction.  Section 3729(a)(1)(A) imposes liability on those who present \xe2\x80\x9cfalse or fraudulent claims\xe2\x80\x9d but does not limit such claims to misrepresentations about express conditions of payment.  See <i>SAIC</i>, 626 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1268 (rejecting any textual basis for an express-designation rule).  Nor does the common-law meaning of fraud tether liability to violating an express condition of payment.  A statement that misleadingly omits critical facts is a misrepresentation irrespective of whether the other party has expressly signaled the importance of the qualifying information.  <i>Supra,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The False Claims Act\xe2\x80\x99s materiality requirement also does not support Universal Health.  Under the Act, the misrepresentation must be material to the other party\xe2\x80\x99s course of action.  But, as discussed below, see <i>infra</i>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements are not automatically material, even if they are labeled conditions of payment.  Cf. <i>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.</i> v. <i>Siracusano</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27,\n39 (2011)\n (materiality cannot rest on \xe2\x80\x9ca single fact or occurrence as always determinative\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>Nor does the Act\xe2\x80\x99s scienter requirement, \xc2\xa73729(b)(1)(A), support Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s position.  A defendant can have \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d that a condition is material without the Government expressly calling it a condition of payment.  If the Government failed to specify that guns it orders must actually shoot, but the defendant knows that the Government routinely rescinds contracts if the guns do not shoot, the defendant has \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Likewise, because a reasonable person would realize the imperative of a functioning firearm, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appreciate the materiality of that condition would amount to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate ignorance\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creckless disregard\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9ctruth or falsity of the information\xe2\x80\x9d even if the Government did not spell this out.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>Universal Health nonetheless contends that False Claims Act liability should be limited to undisclosed violations of expressly designated conditions of payment to provide defendants with fair notice and to cabin liability.

In any event, Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s approach risks undercutting these policy goals.  The Government might respond by designating every<i> </i>legal requirement an express condition of payment.  But billing parties are often subject to thousands of complex statutory and regulatory provisions.  Facing False Claims Act liability for violating any of them would hardly help would-be defendants anticipate and prioritize compliance obligations.  And forcing the Government to expressly designate a provision as a condition of <i>payment</i> would create further arbitrariness.  Under Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s view, misrepresenting compliance with a requirement that the Government expressly identified as a condition of payment could expose a defendant to liability.  Yet, under this theory, misrepresenting compliance with a condition of eligibility to even participate in a federal program when submitting a claim would not.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, other parts of the False Claims Act allay Universal Health\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]nstead of adopting a circumscribed view of what it means for a claim to be false or fraudulent,\xe2\x80\x9d concerns about fair notice and open-ended liability \xe2\x80\x9ccan be effectively addressed through strict enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s materiality and scienter requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>SAIC</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 1270.

In tort law, for instance, a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter is material\xe2\x80\x9d in only two circumstances: (1) \xe2\x80\x9c[if\xc2\xa0] a reasonable man would attach importance to [it] in determining his choice of action in the transaction\xe2\x80\x9d; or (2) if the defendant knew or had reason to know that the recipient of the representation attaches importance to the specific matter \xe2\x80\x9cin determining his choice of action,\xe2\x80\x9d even though a reasonable person would not.  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7538, at 80.  Materiality in contract law is substantially similar.

The False Claims Act is not \xe2\x80\x9can all-purpose antifraud statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Allison Engine</i>, 553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 672, or a vehicle for punishing garden-variety breaches of contract or regulatory violations.  A misrepresentation cannot be deemed material merely because the Government designates compliance with a particular statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement as a condition of payment.  Nor is it sufficient for a finding of materiality that the Government would have the option to decline to pay if it knew of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s noncompliance.  Materiality, in addition, cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.  See <i>United States ex</i>\xc2\xa0<i>rel. Marcus </i>v. <i>Hess</i>,\n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 537,\n543 (1943)\n (contractors\xe2\x80\x99 misrepresentation that they satisfied a non-collusive bidding requirement for federal program contracts violated the False Claims Act because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he government\xe2\x80\x99s money would never have been placed in the joint fund for payment to respondents had its agents known the bids were collusive\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Junius Constr.</i>, 257 N.\xc2\xa0Y., at 400, 178 N.\xc2\xa0E., at 674 (an undisclosed fact was material because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o one can say with reason that the plaintiff would have signed this contract if informed of the likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of the undisclosed fact).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, when evaluating materiality under the False Claims Act, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to expressly iden-tify a provision as a condition of payment is relevant, but not automatically dispositive.  Likewise, proof of materiality can include, but is not necessarily limited to, evidence that the defendant knows that the Government consis-tently refuses to pay claims in the mine run of cases based on noncompliance with the particular statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement.  Conversely, if the Government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not material.  Or, if the Government regularly pays a particular type of claim in full despite actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, and has signaled no change in position, that is strong evidence that the requirements are not material.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These rules lead us to disagree with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s and First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view of materiality: that any statutory, regulatory, or contractual violation is material so long as the defendant knows that the Government would be entitled to refuse payment were it aware of the violation.  See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 30; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctest\xe2\x80\x9d for materiality \xe2\x80\x9cis whether the person knew that the government could lawfully withhold payment\xe2\x80\x9d); 780 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 514; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 29 (statements by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel endorsing this view).  At oral argument, the United States explained the implications of its position: If the Government contracts for health services and adds a requirement that contractors buy American-made staplers, anyone who submits a claim for those services but fails to disclose its use of foreign staplers violates the False Claims Act.  To the Government, liability would attach if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s use of foreign staplers would entitle the Government not to pay the claim in whole or part\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of whether the Government routinely pays claims despite knowing that foreign staplers were used.  <i>Id</i>., at 39\xe2\x80\x9345.  Likewise, if the Government required contractors to aver their compliance with the entire U.\xc2\xa0S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations, then under this view, failing to mention noncompliance with any of those requirements would always be material.  The False Claims Act does not adopt such an extraordinarily expansive view of liability.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because both opinions below assessed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint based on interpretations of \xc2\xa73729(a)(1)(A) that differ from ours, we vacate the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case for reconsideration of whether respondents have sufficiently pleaded a False Claims Act violation.
