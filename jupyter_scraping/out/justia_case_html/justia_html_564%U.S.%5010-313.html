First, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) requires an incumbent LEC to lease \xe2\x80\x9con an unbundled basis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a la carte\xe2\x80\x94network elements specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.  In identifying those elements, the FCC must consider whether access is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d and whether failing to provide it would \xe2\x80\x9cimpair\xe2\x80\x9d the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s provision of service.  \xc2\xa7251(d)(2).  Second, \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs \xe2\x80\x9cprovide \xe2\x80\xa6 interconnection\xe2\x80\x9d between their networks and competitive LECs\xe2\x80\x99 to ensure that a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s customers can call the incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s customers, and vice versa.  The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, the FCC issued its <em>Triennial Review Order</em> deciding, contrary to previous orders, that \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access to existing \xe2\x80\x9centrance facilities\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect the two LECs\xe2\x80\x99 networks\xe2\x80\x94because such facilities are not network elements at all.  The FCC noted, however, that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and backhauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection.  Thus, the practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, following D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em>.  The FCC retreated from the view that entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its previous position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities need not be provided under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3).  Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to such facilities.  The FCC again emphasized that competitive LECs\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnection had not been altered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the <em>Remand Order</em>\xe2\x80\x99s wake, respondent AT&amp;T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates.  Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&amp;T was unlawfully abrogating their \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection.  The Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&amp;T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates.  AT&amp;T challenged the ruling.  Relying on the <em>Remand Order</em>,<em> </em>the Federal District Court ruled in AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the order did not change incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 interconnection obligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> that to satisfy its duty under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2), an incumbent LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnection\xe2\x80\x94and this Court defers to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s views.

Second, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s views do not conflict with 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x99s definition of interconnection as \xe2\x80\x9cthe linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and termination of traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Nor is there any other \xe2\x80\x9creason to suspect that the [FCC\xe2\x80\x99s] in-terpretation does not reflect the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Auer, supra</em>, at 462.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) as <em>amicus curiae[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </em>contends that its regulations require the incumbent provider to do so if the facilities are to be used for interconnection: to link the incumbent provider\xe2\x80\x99s telephone network with the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s network for the mutual exchange of traffic.  We defer to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110 Stat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent providers of local telephone service in order to facilitate market entry by competitors.  <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em> v. <em>Iowa Utilities Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/366/index.html">525 U. S. 366</a>, 371 (1999).  The incumbent local ex-change carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange networks: the physical equipment necessary to receive, properly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.  <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/467/index.html">535 U. S. 467</a>, 490 (2002).  Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could not compete with an incumbent carrier without basically replicating the incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s entire existing network.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by requiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with competitive LECs in several ways, two of which are relevant here.  First, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) requires incumbent LECs to lease \xe2\x80\x9con an unbundled basis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e.</em>, a la carte\xe2\x80\x94network elements specified by the Commission.  This makes it easier for a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch.  In identifying which network elements must be available\nfor unbundled lease under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3), the Commission\nis required to consider whether access is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d\nand whether failing to provide access would \xe2\x80\x9cimpair\xe2\x80\x9d a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s provision of service.  \xc2\xa7251(d)(2).  Second, \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs \xe2\x80\x9cprovide \xe2\x80\xa6 interconnection\xe2\x80\x9d between their networks and competitive LECs\xe2\x80\x99 facilities.  This ensures that customers on a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s network can call customers on the incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s network, and vice versa.  The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis.  It is undisputed that both un-bundled network elements and interconnection must be provided at cost-based rates.  See \xc2\xa7252(d)(1); Brief for Petitioner in No. 10\xe2\x80\x93313, p.\xc2\xa028; Brief for Petitioners in No. 10\xe2\x80\x93329, p.\xc2\xa07; Brief for Respondent 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases concern incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to share existing \xe2\x80\x9centrance facilities\xe2\x80\x9d with competitive LECs.  Entrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect competitive LECs\xe2\x80\x99 networks with incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 networks.  The FCC recently adopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are not among the network elements that \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) requires incumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis at cost-based rates.  See 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.319(e)(2)(i) (2005).  The Commission noted, however, that it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Unbundled Access to Network Elements</em>, 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, \xc2\xb6140 (2005) <em>(Triennial Review Remand Order)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&amp;T Michigan (AT&amp;T), must lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs at cost-based rates.  The FCC interprets its regulations to require AT&amp;T to do so for the purpose of interconnection.  We begin by reviewing the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s recent actions regarding entrance facilities and then explain the particular dispute that is before us today.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous orders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide cost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3).  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obligations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers</em>, 18 FCC Rcd. 16978, 17202\xe2\x80\x9317205, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6365\xe2\x80\x93367 (2003) <em>(Triennial Review Order)</em>.  Explaining that its previous approach had been \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coverly broad,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6366, 365, the Commission concluded that entrance facilities were not subject to the unbundling requirement because they are not network elements at all.  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6366 (entrance facilities \xe2\x80\x9cexist <em>outside</em> the incumbent LEC\xe2\x80\x99s local network\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Commission therefore did not conduct an impairment analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC emphasized, however, the limits of this ruling.  Entrance facilities are used for two purposes: interconnection and backhauling.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It expressly \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not alter\xe2\x80\x9d an incumbent LEC\xe2\x80\x99s obligation under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) to provide \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities in order to \xe2\x80\x98interconnect with the incumbent LEC\xe2\x80\x99s network.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6366 (brackets omitted).  Thus, al-though the Commission specified that \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) did not require any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities, it determined in practical effect only that \xe2\x80\x9cincumbent LECs [were not obligated] to unbundle [entrance facilities] for the purpose of backhauling traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6365.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct review, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit questioned the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s determination that entrance facilities are not network elements under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3), but found the agency rulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the Commission for further consideration.  See <em>United States Telecom Assn.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 554, 586, cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/925/index.html">543 U. S. 925</a> (2004).  The court noted that if entrance facilities were in fact \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98network elements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9can analysis of impairment would presumably follow.\xe2\x80\x9d  359 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 586.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, the Commission responded. <em> </em>See <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6136\xe2\x80\x93141.  The Commission re-treated from its view that entrance facilities are not network elements but adhered to its previous position that cost-based unbundled access to them need not be provided under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3).  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6137\xe2\x80\x93138.  Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the Commission concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to them<em>.</em> <em>Ibid.</em>  The Commission again emphasized that it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6140.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the wake of the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em>, AT&amp;T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates.  Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) that AT&amp;T was unlawfully abrogating their right to cost-based interconnection under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2).  The Michigan PSC agreed with the competitive LECs and ordered AT&amp;T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T challenged the Michigan PSC\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the District Court, which, relying on the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em>, ruled in AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Michigan PSC and several competitive LECs, including petitioner Talk America, Inc., appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed over a dissent.  <em>Michigan Bell Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>Covad Communications Co.</em>,<em> </em>597 F.\xc2\xa03d 370 (2010).

The company points out that \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) does not mention incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 facilities, but rather mandates only that incumbent LECs provide interconnection \xe2\x80\x9cfor the facilities and equipment of any [competing] carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  In contrast, AT&amp;T notes, \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs provide unbundled \xe2\x80\x9caccess to [their] network elements.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not find the statute so clear.  Although \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) does not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease facilities to provide interconnection, it also does not expressly excuse them from doing so.

The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation proceeds in three steps.  First, an incumbent LEC must lease \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically feasible\xe2\x80\x9d facilities for interconnection.  Second, entrance facili-\nties are among the facilities that an incumbent must \nmake available for interconnection, if technically feasible.  Third, it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission first contends that an incumbent LEC must lease, at cost-based rates, any requested facilities\nfor obtaining interconnection with the incumbent LEC\xe2\x80\x99s network, unless it is technically infeasible to do so.  Section 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide interconnection, at cost-based rates, \xe2\x80\x9cat any technically feasible point within the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s network.\xe2\x80\x9d  The FCC\nhas long construed \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs to provide, at cost-based rates, \xe2\x80\x9cany technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection \xe2\x80\xa6 at a particular point.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 CFR \xc2\xa751.321(a) (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirement in \xc2\xa751.321(a) to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of obtaining interconnection,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission argues, encompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a competing LEC.  When the Commission originally promulgated \xc2\xa751.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be required to \xe2\x80\x9cadapt their facilities to interconnection\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9caccept the novel use of, and modification to, [their] network facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996</em>, 11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15605, \xc2\xb6202 (1996) <em>(Local Competition Order)</em>.  Since then, as AT&amp;T and its <em>amici</em> concede, incumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at cost-based prices to accommodate interconnection.  See Brief for Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9329; Brief for United States Telecom Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 33\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As additional support for its assertion that incumbent LECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights the examples in \xc2\xa751.321(b) of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]echnically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection,\xe2\x80\x9d which include \xe2\x80\x9c[m]eet point interconnection arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a meet-point arrangement, an incumbent LEC \xe2\x80\x9caccommodat[es]\xe2\x80\x9d interconnection by building a transmission facility from its network to a designated point, where it connects with the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding transmission facility.  <em>Local Competition Order</em> \xc2\xb6553.  Compared to that requirement, the Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing facilities for interconnection is quite modest.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the Commission contends that existing entrance facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease for interconnection.  According to the FCC, the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> adopted a regulatory def-inition that reestablished that entrance facilities are\npart of an incumbent LEC\xe2\x80\x99s network.  See \xc2\xb6137; see also 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.319(e) (2005).  The end of every entrance facility is therefore a \xe2\x80\x9cpoint within [an incumbent] carrier\xe2\x80\x99s network\xe2\x80\x9d at which a competing LEC could request interconnection, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7251(c)(2), and each entrance facility potentially provides a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically feasible method of obtaining interconnection,\xe2\x80\x9d 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.321(a) (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the FCC contends that providing access to the entrance facilities here for interconnection purposes is technically feasible.  Under the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s regulations, an incumbent LEC bears the burden of showing that a requested method or point of interconnection is technically infeasible.  See 47 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.305(e), 51.321(d); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa751.305(d), 51.321(c) (previously successful intercon-nection is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of technical feasibility).

First, we disagree with AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument that entrance facilities are not a part of incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 networks.  Indeed, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view on this question is more than reasonable; it is certainly not plainly erroneous.  The <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> responded to the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision questioning the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s earlier finding that entrance facilities are not network elements.  It revised\nthe definition of dedicated transport\xe2\x80\x94a type of network element\xe2\x80\x94to include entrance facilities.  <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>\xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6136\xe2\x80\x93137; see 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.319(e)(1) (defining dedicated transport to include \xe2\x80\x9cincumbent LEC transmission facilities \xe2\x80\xa6 between wire centers or switches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned by [competing] carriers\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that revised definition, it is perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are a part of incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 networks.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we are not persuaded by AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views conflict with the definition of interconnection in \xc2\xa751.5.  That regulation provides: \xe2\x80\x9cInterconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.  This term does not include the transport and termination of traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T focuses on the definition\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9ctransport and termination of traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&amp;T argues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent LEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection when the definition of interconnection expressly excludes transport.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think AT&amp;T reads too much into the exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9ctransport.\xe2\x80\x9d  The regulation cannot possibly mean that no transport can occur across an interconnection facility, as that would directly conflict with the statutory language.  See \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) (requiring \xe2\x80\x9cinterconnection \xe2\x80\xa6 for the transmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange service\xe2\x80\x9d).  The very reason for interconnection is the \xe2\x80\x9cmutual exchange of traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 CFR \xc2\xa751.5; see also <em>Competitive Telecommunications Assn.</em> v.<em> FCC</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa03d 1068, 1071\xe2\x80\x931072 (CA8 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he transmission and routing of telephone exchange service\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the interconnection, the physical link, would be used for\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The better reading of the regulation is that it merely reflects that the \xe2\x80\x9ctransport and termination of traffic\xe2\x80\x9d is subject to different regulatory treatment than interconnection.  Compensation for transport and termination\xe2\x80\x94that is, for delivering local telephone calls placed by\nanother carrier\xe2\x80\x99s customer\xe2\x80\x94is governed by separate stat-utory provisions and regulations.  See 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7251(b)(5), 252(d)(2); 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.701.  The Commission explains that a competitive LEC typically pays one fee for interconnection\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cjust for having the link\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then an additional fee for the transport and termination of telephone calls.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>3, n.\xc2\xa01.  Entrance facilities, at least when used for the mutual exchange of traffic, seem to us to fall comfortably within the definition of interconnection.  See 597 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 388 (Sutton, J., dissenting) (noting that entrance facilities are \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned for the very purpose of linking two carriers\xe2\x80\x99 networks\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its regulations is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulatory text.  Contrary to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, there is no danger that deferring to the Commission would effectively \xe2\x80\x9cpermit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create <em>de facto</em> a new regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Christensen</em> v. <em>Harris County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/576/index.html">529 U.

The Commission ex-plains that the issue in these cases did not arise until recently\xe2\x80\x94when it initially eliminated unbundled access to entrance facilities in the <em>Triennial Review Order</em>.  Until then, the Commission says, a competitive LEC typically would elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) could be used for any purpose\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, both interconnection and backhauling\xe2\x80\x94but entrance facilities leased under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) can be used only for interconnection.  We see no reason to doubt this explanation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT&amp;T suggests that the Commission is attempting to require under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) and what the Commission itself said was <em>not </em>required in the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em>.

The Commission was not compelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled entrance facilities at cost-based rates.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that, prior to the <em>Triennial Review </em>orders, the Commission twice unsuccessfully attempted to impose sweeping unbundling requirements on incumbent LECs.  See <em>Local Competition Order</em> \xc2\xb6278; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996</em>, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3771\xe2\x80\x933904, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6162\xe2\x80\x93464 (1999); see also 47 CFR \xc2\xa751.319 (1997); \xc2\xa751.319 (2000).  Each time, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were rejected for taking an unreasonably broad view of \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7251(d)(2).  See <em>Iowa Utilities Bd.</em>,<em> </em>525 U.

S. 940</a> (2003).  In the <em>Triennial Review Order</em>, the Commission once again reinterpreted the \xe2\x80\x9cimpair\xe2\x80\x9d standard and revised the list of network elements that incumbents must provide unbundled to competitors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s initial decision to eliminate the obligation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not\na result of the narrower view of impairment mandated\nby this Court and the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  Instead, the Commission determined that entrance facilities need not be provided on an unbundled basis under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) on the novel ground that they are not network elements at all\xe2\x80\x94something no court had ever suggested.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the unbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commission has been committed to that position.  When the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit questioned the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s finding that entrance facilities are not network elements, the Commission responded by observing that the court \xe2\x80\x9cdid not reject our conclusion that incumbent LECs need not unbundle entrance facilities, only the analysis through which we reached that conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> \xc2\xb6137.  The Commission then found another way to support that same conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of what the Commission has done, and is doing, is inaccurate.  The <em>Triennial Review </em>orders eliminated incumbent LECs\xe2\x80\x99 obli-gation under \xc2\xa7251(c)(3) to provide unbundled access to entrance facilities.  But the FCC emphasized in both orders that it \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not alter\xe2\x80\x9d the obligation on incumbent LECs under \xc2\xa7251(c)(2) to provide facilities for interconnection purposes.  <em>Triennial Review Order</em> \xc2\xb6366; <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> \xc2\xb6140.  Because entrance facilities are used for backhauling and interconnection purposes, the FCC effectively eliminated only unbundled access to entrance facilities for backhauling purposes\xe2\x80\x94a nuance it expressly noted in the first <em>Triennial Review </em>order.  <em>Triennial Review Order</em> \xc2\xb6365.  That distinction is neither unusual nor ambiguous.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In these cases, the Commission is simply explaining the interconnection obligation that it left undisturbed in the <em>Triennial Review </em>orders.  We see no conflict between the <em>Triennial Review</em> orders and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s views expressed here.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not concerned that the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>did not expressly distinguish between backhauling and interconnection, though AT&amp;T makes much of that fact.  AT&amp;T argues that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s holding\nin the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>is broader than that in the <em>Triennial Review Order</em>.  In AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Commission concluded in the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>that competitors are not impaired if they lack cost-based access to entrance facilities for backhauling <em>or</em> interconnection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two flaws with AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  First, as we have discussed, the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> reinstated the ultimate conclusion of the <em>Triennial Review Order</em> and changed only \xe2\x80\x9cthe analysis through which [it] reached that conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> \xc2\xb6137.  Second, unlike \xc2\xa7251(c)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s unbundling obligation, \xc2\xa7251(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s interconnection obligation does not require the Commission to consider impairment.  As the dissent below observed, it would be surprising indeed if the FCC had taken the novel step of incorporating impairment into interconnection without comment.  597 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 389 (opinion of Sutton, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC as <em>amicus curiae </em>has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations, and we defer to its views.

Unbundled network elements, for example, may not be used for the exclusive provision of mobile wireless or long-distance services.  47 CFR \xc2\xa751.309(b) (2010).  Similarly, interconnection arrangements may be used for local telephone service but not for long-distance services.  \xc2\xa751.305(b).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The parties and their <em>amici </em>dispute whether an incumbent LEC\nhas any way of knowing how a competitive LEC is using an entrance facility.  This technical factual dispute simply underscores the appropriateness of deferring to the FCC.  So long as the Commission is acting within the scope of its delegated authority and in accordance with prescribed procedures, it has greater expertise and stands in a better position than this Court to make the technical and policy judgments necessary to administer the complex regulatory program at issue here.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963635">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nTALK AMERICA, INC.

I would reach the same result even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own regulations, a rule in recent years attributed to our opinion in <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 461 (1997), though it first appeared in our jurisprudence more than half a century earlier, see <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/325/410/index.html">325 U. S. 410</a> (1945).  In this suit I have no need to rely on <em>Auer </em>deference, because I believe the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is the fairest reading of the orders in question.  Most cogently, \xc2\xb6140 of the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order</em> serves no purpose unless one accepts (as AT&amp;T does not) the distinction between backhauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes to \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6138 and 141 of the order.  20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2610\xe2\x80\x932612 (2005).  The order would have been clearer, to be sure, if the distinction had been made in a footnote to \xc2\xb6140 itself, but the distinction is there, and without it \xc2\xb6140 has no point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is comforting to know that I would reach the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result even without <em>Auer.  </em>For while I have in the past uncritically accepted that rule, I have become increasingly doubtful of its validity.  On the surface, it seems to be a natural corollary\xe2\x80\x94indeed, an <em>a fortiori</em> application\xe2\x80\x94of the rule that we will defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute it is charged with implementing, see <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984).  But it is not.  When Congress enacts an imprecise statute that it commits to the implementation of an executive agency, it has no control over that implementation (except, of course, through further, more precise, legislation).  The legislative and executive functions are not combined.  But when an agency promulgates an imprecise rule, it leaves <em>to itself</em> the implementation of that rule, and thus the initial determination of the rule\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  And though the adoption of a rule is an exercise of the executive rather than the legislative power, a properly adopted rule has fully the effect of law.  It seems contrary to fundamental principles of separation of powers to permit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as well.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151\xe2\x80\x93152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deferring to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a statute does not encourage Congress, out of a desire to expand its power, to enact vague statutes; the vagueness effectively cedes power to the Executive.  By contrast, deferring to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its own rule encourages the agency to enact vague rules which give it the power, in future adjudications, to do what it pleases.  This frustrates the notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and promotes arbitrary government.  The seeming inappro-priateness of <em>Auer</em> deference is especially evident in cases such as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly been rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same ends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are undoubted advantages to <em>Auer </em>deference.  It makes the job of a reviewing court much easier, and since it usually produces affirmance of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s view without conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has spoken to clarify the regulation) certainty and predict-ability to the administrative process.  The defects of <em>Auer </em>deference, and the alternatives to it, are fully explored in Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 612 (1996).  We have not been asked to reconsider <em>Auer </em>in the present case.  When we are, I will be receptive to doing so.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
