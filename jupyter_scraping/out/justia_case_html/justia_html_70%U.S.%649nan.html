Under the second section of the Act of 8 August, 1840, "to regulate the proceedings in the circuit and district courts," and which, after authorizing the transfer of criminal causes from either court to the other on motion of the district attorney, says that</p>\n<p>"The court to which such remission is made shall, after the order of remission is filed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="650">Page 70 U.

And a demurrer to the indictment made in the district court may properly receive a joinder in the circuit court.</p>\n<p>2. The twenty-fifth section of the Act of 3 March, 1863, "for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes," must be construed by the twelfth section of the Amendatory Act of 24 February, 1864, and so construed, it does not embrace services in relation to an enrollment.</p>\n<p>An act of Congress, passed during the late rebellion, entitled "An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes," and which has numerous provisions tending to prescribe a mode of giving effect to its purpose, provides in its 23d section that</p>\n<p>"If any person shall resist any draft of men enrolled under this act into the service of the United States, or shall counsel, or aid any person to resist any such draft, or shall <em>assault or obstruct any officer in making such draft, or in the performance of any service in relation thereto, or shall counsel any person to assault or obstruct any such officer,</em> such person shall be subject to summary arrest by the provost marshal and shall be forthwith delivered to the civil authorities, and upon conviction thereof be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding two years, or by both of said punishments."</p>\n<p>This act was passed March 3, 1863.</p>\n<p>On the 24th February, 1864, Congress passed an act amendatory of it. The 12th section of this amendatory act runs thus:</p>\n<p>"That any person who shall forcibly resist or oppose any <em>enrollment,</em> or shall incite, counsel, encourage, or who shall conspire or confederate with any other person or persons forcibly to resist or oppose any such <em>enrollment,</em> or who shall aid or assist, or take any part in any forcible resistance or opposition thereto, or who shall assault, obstruct, impede, or threaten any officer or other person employed in making or aiding to make any such <em>enrollment,</em> or employed in the performance, or aiding in the performance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 70 U.

In April, 1864, the district court on the motion of the same district attorney, remitted the case <em>back</em> to the circuit court, and in this last court the United States joined in the demurrer.</p>\n<p>These remissions, forward and back, were conceived by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 70 U.

Whether the court had jurisdiction, the indictment having been found in the circuit court, remitted to the district court, and by the district court again remitted into this Court.</p>\n<p>2d.  Whether the offense charged in the indictment -- namely an assault and obstruction of an officer in making an enrollment of men for military duty -- is embraced in the 25th section of the act of 1863 as an assault or obstruction of an officer in making the draft or in the performance of services in relation thereto.</p>\n<p>And these two questions were now here for resolution.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that under the circumstances of this case, the circuit court had jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p>We see no reason in the nature of the transaction, nor in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 70 U. S. 653</a></p><p> the language of the statute of 8th of August, 1846, under which the remission is supposed by the counsel of the United States to be justified, why a case brought into the district court by an order of this kind should not be sent back under proper circumstances.  The order can only be made on the motion of the district attorney, or whenever in the opinion of the district court difficult and important questions of law are involved in the case.  There is therefore no danger of collision between the courts on account of such orders, and as they tend to the dispatch of business and to sound decisions on legal propositions, there is no reason for limiting the rule further than the language of the statute requires.</p>\n<p><em>As respects the second question.</em> -- The defendants were indicted for assaulting an officer while engaged "in making an enrollment of men subject to do military duty."  This language describes with entire accuracy the offense provided for by the 12th section of the Act of February 24, 1864.  But the indictment was found before that act was passed.  It was found under the 25th section of the Act of March 3, 1863, on the supposition that making an enrollment was a service relating to the draft, and the judges divided on the question whether this was so within the meaning of the last-mentioned act.</p>\n<p>If Congress had not passed the Amendatory Act of February 24, 1864, it might very well have been asserted that making an enrollment of persons liable to draft was a service relating to the draft, for, being a necessary preliminary to putting the draft in force, it bears a very close relation to it.  We have, however, held in the case of the <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/642/case.html">United States v. Scott,</a></span></em> just preceding, upon a comparison of the 25th section of the act of 1863 with the 12th section of the act of 1864, that the one is limited to the prevention of resistance to the draft and the other to preventing resistance to the enrollment.  Comparing the two acts together, the later one must be held to be a legislative construction of the first, by which a service in relation to the enrollment cannot be held to be a service in relation to the draft. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 70 U. S. 654</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The first of the questions certified to us must be answered in the affirmative, and the second in the negative.</p>\n<p><em>Answers accordingly.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
