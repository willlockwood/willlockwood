The District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to a term of imprisonment.  It also acknowledged that restitution was mandatory but deferred determination of the restitution amount.  Petitioner filed a notice of appeal from this initial judgment.  Months later, the District Court entered an amended judgment, ordering petitioner to pay restitution to one of his victims.  Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the amended judgment.

Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the District Court was required to order petitioner to \xe2\x80\x9cmake restitution to the victim of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73663A(a)(1); see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72259(a), (b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn order of restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with [\xc2\xa7]3664 in the same manner as an order under [\xc2\xa7]3663A\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprisonment and a life term of supervised release.  At the sentencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution was mandatory.  But, consistent with the MVRA, the court postponed determining the victims\xe2\x80\x99 damages, which had not yet been ascertained.

Filing a notice of appeal transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.  The statute that governs appeals of criminal sentences,\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73742(a), provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant may file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence\xe2\x80\x9d in certain specified circumstances.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ruiz</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622\n\xe2\x88\x92628 (2002).  And Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) specifies that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may be taken <i>only</i> by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both \xc2\xa73742(a) and Rule 4 contemplate that the defendant will file the notice of appeal <i>after </i>the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed.  Section 3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal of a sentence that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>was</i> imposed in violation of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides generally that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a criminal case, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days <i>after</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.  His notice of appeal could not have been \xe2\x80\x9cfor review\xe2\x80\x9d of the restitution order, \xc2\xa73742(a), and it was not filed within the timeframe allowed by Rule 4.  He thus failed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules the amended judgment imposing restitution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal from the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution amount.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Brief for United States 28\xe2\x80\x9331.  This position follows, according to the Government, from many of our cases emphasizing the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional significance\xe2\x80\x9d of a notice of appeal.  <i>E.g.</i>,<i> Griggs</i> v. <i>Provident Consumer Discount Co.</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56,\n58 (1982)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  Because the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the Government explains, the Court of Appeals was required to dismiss petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal regardless of whether the Government raised the issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We do not need to decide in this case whether the Government is correct.  The requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule.  See <i>Greenlaw</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 237\n\xe2\x80\x93253 (2008); see also Rule 3(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn appellant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take any step <i>other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal</i> does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Mandatory claim-processing rules \xe2\x80\x9cseek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Shinseki</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428,\n435 (2011)\n.  Unlike jurisdictional rules, mandatory claim-processing rules may be forfeited \xe2\x80\x9cif the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Eberhart</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12,\n15 (2005)\n (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If a party \xe2\x80\x9cproperly raise[s] them,\xe2\x80\x9d however, they are \xe2\x80\x9cunalterable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 15, 19.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government timely raised petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution before the Court of Appeals.  See Brief for United States in No. 14\xe2\x80\x9313029 (CA11), pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9325 (arguing that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cwaived his right to appeal the district court\xe2\x80\x99s order of restitution by failing to file a notice of appeal from that order\xe2\x80\x9d (capitalization omitted)).  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x99s duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Eberhart</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 18.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal both the initial judgment and the amended judgment imposing restitution.  As we understand it, his argument depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it \xe2\x80\x9csprings forward\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.  We reject each of these premises.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner argues that the initial judgment deferring restitution and the amended judgment imposing a specific restitution amount merge to become \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment\xe2\x80\x9d referenced in the Federal Rules.  See Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) (notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days after \xe2\x80\x9cthe entry of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the judgment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. being appealed\xe2\x80\x9d); Rule 4(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cFiling Before Entry of Judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  He argues that his notice of appeal, which was filed within 14 days of the initial judgment, was therefore sufficient to invoke appellate review of the merged judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s approach is inconsistent with our reasoning in <i>Dolan</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605\n.  The petitioner in that case argued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is the <i>only </i>final<i>, </i>appealable judgment in a deferred restitution case.  See <i>id.</i>, at 616.  Although we did not decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or when a party can, or must, appeal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the question presented here\xe2\x80\x94we were not persuaded by the argument that \xe2\x80\x9ca sentencing judgment is not \xe2\x80\x98final\xe2\x80\x99 until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 617\xe2\x80\x93618.  To the contrary, we recognized \xe2\x80\x9cstrong arguments\xe2\x80\x9d supporting the proposition that both the \xe2\x80\x9cinitial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release\xe2\x80\x9d and the subsequent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sentence that impose[d] an order of restitution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d were each immediately appealable final judgments.  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73582(b) (imprisonment), 3583(a) (supervised release), and 3664(<i>o</i>) (restitution)).  Consequently, we were not surprised \xe2\x80\x9cto find instances where a defendant ha[d] appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csubsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 618.  Our analysis in <i>Dolan</i> thus makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Rule 4(b)(2) is also misplaced.  That Rule provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order\xe2\x80\x94but before the entry of the judgment or order\xe2\x80\x94is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  A prematurely filed notice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.  As this Court explained in construing Rule 4(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s parallel provision for civil cases, the Rule \xe2\x80\x9cwas intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FirsTier Mortgage Co.</i> v. <i>Investors Mortgage Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 269,\n276 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been \xe2\x80\x9cannounce[d]\xe2\x80\x9d and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.  See Rule 4(b)(6) (\xe2\x80\x9cA judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the court has not yet decided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then the Rule does not come into play.  Accordingly, it does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.  By deferring restitution, the court is <i>declining</i> to announce a sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 27.  The court did not announce the restitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue) until months later.  Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9csentence\xe2\x80\x9d that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cannounced\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.  Rather, he argued on appeal that the <i>amount</i> of the restitution imposed\xe2\x80\x94an issue the court did not consider until months later\xe2\x80\x94is unlawful.  Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of appeal did not \xe2\x80\x9cspring forward\xe2\x80\x9d to become effective on the date the court entered its amended judgment imposing that sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, petitioner argues in the alternative that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error, citing <i>Lemke</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 325 (1953)\n (<i>per curiam</i>).  In that case, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced but three days before the judgment was entered.  <i>Id.</i>, at 326.  His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.  This Court reversed on the ground that the premature filing was harmless error under Rule 52(a).  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Lemke</i> does not apply to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.  <i>Lemke</i> has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.  First, the <i>Lemke </i>petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).  As discussed in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932, <i>supra</i>, petitioner here cannot take advantage of that rule.  Second, Rule 3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors associated with filing a notice of appeal.  The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal <i>other</i> than the failure to timely file a notice.  It may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.  The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <i>supra,</i> meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.  By definition, mandatory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture, are not subject to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution, but rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.  Courts do not have discretion to overlook such an error, at least where it is called to their attention.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that a defendant who wishes to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.  Because petitioner failed to do so, and the Government objected, the Court of Appeals properly declined to consider his challenge to the amount of restitution imposed.

See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Eberhart</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12\n\xe2\x80\x9319 (2005) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Kontrick</i> v. <i>Ryan</i>,\n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 443\n\xe2\x80\x93456 (2004).  That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing claim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Thaler</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134\n\xe2\x80\x93143 (2012); <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Shinseki</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428\n\xe2\x80\x93436, 441\xe2\x80\x93442 (2011); <i>Scarborough</i> v. <i>Principi</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 401\n\xe2\x80\x93414 (2004); cf. <i>Bowles</i> v. <i>Russell</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205\n\xe2\x80\x93213 (2007) (distinguishing statutory prescriptions from procedural rules).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order.  But even assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required, I would hold that Manrique is not barred from appealing the restitution order in the circumstances of this case.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c<i>Appealing a Sentence</i>.  After sentencing\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea\xe2\x80\x94the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice upon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014, see App. 29; that court gave no such advice upon amending its judgment on September 18, 2014 to include the amount of restitution ordered, see <i>id.</i>, at 10, 46\xe2\x80\x9365.  The Government agrees that the District Court was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d required to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the restitution order, and anticipates that the required advice \xe2\x80\x9cwill prevent cases like this from arising again in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to appeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals.  Without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court.  App. 10.  In turn, the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up the transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing.  See Docket in No. 14\xe2\x80\x9313029 (CA11).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cconfer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Griggs</i> v. <i>Provident Consumer Discount Co.</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56,\n58 (1982)\n (<i>per curiam</i>).  In other words, in lieu of trapping an unwary defendant, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, I would rank the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s transmission of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals as an adequate substitute for a second notice of appeal.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because I would treat the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s transmission of the amended judgment as tantamount to, or effectively doing service for, a second appeal notice, I would reverse the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and allow Manrique to include the restitution order in his appeal.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Given the steps taken by the District Court, Court of Appeals, and the clerks of those courts, it was likely no surprise to the Government when Manrique challenged the restitution award in his opening brief on appeal.
