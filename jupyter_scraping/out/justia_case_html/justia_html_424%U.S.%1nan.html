Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), as amended in 1974, provides for public financing of Presidential nominating conventions and general election and primary campaigns from general revenues and allocates such funding to conventions and general election campaigns by establishing three categories:  (1) "major" parties (those whose candidate received 25% or more of the vote in the most recent election), which receive full funding; (2) "minor" parties (those whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the votes at the last election), which receive only a percentage of the funds to which the major parties are entitled; and (3) "new" parties (all other parties), which are limited to receipt of post-election funds or are not entitled to any funds if their candidate receives less than 5% of the vote.  A primary candidate for the Presidential nomination by a political party who receives more than $5,000 from private sources (counting only the first $250 of each contribution) in each of at least 20 States is eligible for matching public funds.  Appellants (various federal officeholders and candidates, supporting political organizations, and others) brought suit against appellees (the Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House, Comptroller General, Attorney General, and the Commission) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the above statutory provisions on various constitutional grounds.  The Court of Appeals, on certified questions from the District Court, upheld all but one of the statutory provisions.

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 424 U. S. 7</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, in sustaining the legislation in large part against various constitutional challenges, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] viewed it as "by far the most comprehensive reform legislation [ever] passed by Congress concerning the election of the President, Vice-President, and members of Congress."  171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 182, 519 F.2d 821, 831 (1975).  The statutes at issue, summarized in broad terms, contain the following provisions:  (a) individual political contributions are limited to $1,000 to any single candidate per election, with an over-all annual limitation of $25,000 by any contributor; independent expenditures by individuals and groups "relative to a clearly identified candidate" are limited to $1,000 a year; campaign spending by candidates for various federal offices and spending for national conventions by political parties are subject to prescribed limits; (b) contributions and expenditures above certain threshold levels must be reported and publicly disclosed; (c) a system for public funding of Presidential campaign activities is established by Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code; [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and (d) a Federal Election Commission is established to administer and enforce the legislation.</p>\n<p>This suit was originally filed by appellants in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Plaintiffs included a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, a United States Senator who is a candidate for reelection, a potential contributor, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 424 U. S. 8</a></p><p> Committee for a Constitutional Presidency -- McCarthy \'76, the Conservative Party of the State of New York, the Mississippi Republican Party, the Libertarian Party, the New York Civil Liberties Union, Inc., the American Conservative Union, the Conservative Victory Fund, and Human Events, Inc.  The defendants included the Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, both in their official capacities and as <em>ex officio</em> members of the Federal Election Commission.  The Commission itself was named as a defendant.  Also named were the Attorney General of the United States and the Comptroller General of the United States.</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1331, 2201, and 2202, and \xc2\xa7 315(a) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 437h(a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The complaint sought both a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 424 U. S. 9</a></p><p> declaratory judgment that the major provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and an injunction against enforcement of those provisions.  Appellants requested the convocation of a three-judge District Court as to all matters and also requested certification of constitutional questions to the Court of Appeals, pursuant to the terms of \xc2\xa7 315(a).  The District Judge denied the application for a three-judge court and directed that the case be transmitted to the Court of Appeals.  That court entered an order stating that the case was "preliminarily deemed" to be properly certified under \xc2\xa7 315(a).  Leave to intervene was granted to various groups and individuals. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  After considering matters regarding factfinding procedures, the Court of Appeals entered an order en banc remanding the case to the District Court to (1) identify the constitutional issues in the complaint; (2) take whatever evidence was found necessary in addition to the submissions suitably dealt with by way of judicial notice; (3) make findings of fact with reference to those issues; and (4) certify the constitutional questions arising from the foregoing steps to the Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  On remand, the District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 424 U. S. 10</a></p><p> Judge entered a memorandum order adopting extensive findings of fact and transmitting the augmented record back to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>On plenary review, a majority of the Court of Appeals rejected, for the most part, appellants\' constitutional attacks.  The court found "a clear and compelling interest," 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 192, 519 F.2d at 841, in preserving the integrity of the electoral process.  On that basis, the court upheld, with one exception, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the substantive provisions of the Act with respect to contributions, expenditures, and disclosure.  It also sustained the constitutionality of the newly established Federal Election Commission.  The court concluded that, notwithstanding the manner of selection of its members and the breadth of its powers, which included nonlegislative functions, the Commission is a constitutionally authorized agency created to perform primarily legislative functions. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 424 U. S. 11</a></p><p> The provisions for public funding of the three stages of the Presidential selection process were upheld as a valid exercise of congressional power under the General Welfare Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8.</p>\n<p>In this Court, appellants argue that the Court of Appeals failed to give this legislation the critical scrutiny demanded under accepted First Amendment and equal protection principles.  In appellants\' view, limiting the use of money for political purposes constitutes a restriction on communication violative of the First Amendment, since virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of money.  Further, they argue that the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Act unconstitutionally impinge on their right to freedom of association.  Appellants also view the federal subsidy provisions of Subtitle H as violative of the General Welfare Clause, and as inconsistent with the First and Fifth Amendments.  Finally, appellants renew their attack on the Commission\'s composition and powers.</p>\n<p>At the outset, we must determine whether the case before us presents a "case or controversy" within the meaning of Art. III of the Constitution.  Congress may not, of course, require this Court to render opinions in matters which are not "cases or controversies."  <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html">300 U.

We must therefore decide whether appellants have the "personal stake in the outcome of the controversy" necessary to meet the requirements of Art. III.  <em>Baker v.

In our view, the complaint in this case demonstrates that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient "personal stake" [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions to present</p>\n<p>"a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts."</p>\n<p><em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html#241">300 U. S. 241</a></span>. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3>. CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS<p></p>\n<p>The intricate statutory scheme adopted by Congress to regulate federal election campaigns includes restrictions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 424 U. S. 13</a></p><p> on political contributions and expenditures that apply broadly to all phases of and all participants in the election process.  The major contribution and expenditure limitations in the Act prohibit individuals from contributing more than $25,000 in a single year or more than $1,000 to any single candidate for an election campaign [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and from spending more than $1,000 a year "relative to a clearly identified candidate." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Other provisions restrict a candidate\'s use of personal and family resources in his campaign [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and limit the over-all amount that can be spent by a candidate in campaigning for federal office. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections is well established and is not questioned by any of the parties in this case. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Thus, the critical constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 424 U. S. 14</a></p><p> questions presented here go not to the basic power of Congress to legislate in this area, but to whether the specific legislation that Congress has enacted interferes with First Amendment freedoms or invidiously discriminates against nonincumbent candidates and minor parties in contravention of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>A. General Principles\n</em></p>\n<p>The Act\'s contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.  Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.  The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order "to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people."  <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#484">354 U. S. 484</a></span> (1957).  Although First Amendment protections are not confined to "the exposition of ideas," <em>Winters v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html">333 U. S. 507</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/case.html#510">333 U. S. 510</a></span> (1948),</p>\n<p>"there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course includ[ing] discussions of candidates. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Mills v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html">384 U. S. 214</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html#218">384 U. S. 218</a></span> (1966).  This no more than reflects our "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#270">376 U. S. 270</a></span> (1964).  In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 424 U. S. 15</a></p><p> for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation.  As the Court observed in <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/case.html">401 U. S. 265</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/case.html#272">401 U. S. 272</a></span> (1971),</p>\n<p>"it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office."</p>\n<p>The First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression.  The constitutional right of association explicated in <em>NAACP v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html">357 U. S. 449</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#460">357 U. S. 460</a></span> (1958), stemmed from the Court\'s recognition that</p>\n<p>"[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association."</p>\n<p>Subsequent decisions have made clear that the First and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee "<em>freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas,\'" a freedom that encompasses "`[t]he right to associate with the political party of one\'s choice.\'"  <em>Kusper v. Pontikes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html">414 U. S. 51</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html#56">414 U.

S. 477</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html#487">419 U. S. 487</a></span> (1975).\n</em></p>\n<p>It is with these principles in mind that we consider the primary contentions of the parties with respect to the Act\'s limitations upon the giving and spending of money in political campaigns.  Those conflicting contentions could not more sharply define the basic issues before us.  Appellees contend that what the Act regulates is conduct, and that its effect on speech and association is incidental, at most.  Appellants respond that contributions and expenditures are at the very core of political speech, and that the Act\'s limitations thus constitute restraints on First Amendment liberty that are both gross and direct.</p>\n<p>In upholding the constitutional validity of the Act\'s contribution and expenditure provisions on the ground </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 424 U. S. 16</a></p><p> that those provisions should be viewed as regulating conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals relied upon <em>United States v. O\'Brien,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html">391 U. S. 367</a></span> (1968).  <em>See</em> 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 191, 519 F.2d at 840.  The <em>O\'Brien</em> case involved a defendant\'s claim that the First Amendment prohibited his prosecution for burning his draft card because his act was "<em>symbolic speech\'" engaged in as a "`demonstration against the war and against the draft.\'"  391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#376">391 U. S. 376</a></span>.  On the assumption that "the alleged communicative element in O\'Brien\'s conduct [was] sufficient to bring into play the First Amendment," the Court sustained the conviction because it found "a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element" that was "unrelated to the suppression of free expression" and that had an "incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms . . . no greater than [was] essential to the furtherance of that interest."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#376">391 U. S. 376</a></span>-377.  The Court expressly emphasized that <em>O\'Brien</em> was not a case\n</em></p>\n<p>"where the alleged governmental interest in regulating conduct arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#382">391 U. S. 382</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We cannot share the view that the present Act\'s contribution and expenditure limitations are comparable to the restrictions on conduct upheld in <em>O\'Brien.</em>  The expenditure of money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as destruction of a draft card.  Some forms of communication made possible by the giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct primarily, and some involve a combination of the two.  Yet this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment.  <em>See Bigelow v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html">421 U. S. 809</a></span>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 424 U. S. 17</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/809/case.html#820">421 U. S. 820</a></span> (1975); <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#266">376 U. S. 266</a></span>.  For example, in <em>Cox v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/559/case.html">379 U. S. 559</a></span> (1965), the Court contrasted picketing and parading with a newspaper comment and a telegram by a citizen to a public official.  The parading and picketing activities were said to constitute conduct "intertwined with expression and association," whereas the newspaper comment and the telegram were described as a "pure form of expression" involving "free speech alone," rather than "expression mixed with particular conduct."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/559/case.html#563">379 U. S. 563</a></span>-564.</p>\n<p>Even if the categorization of the expenditure of money as conduct were accepted, the limitations challenged here would not meet the <em>O\'Brien</em> test because the governmental interests advanced in support of the Act involve "suppressing communication."  The interests served by the Act include restricting the voices of people and interest groups who have money to spend and reducing the over-all scope of federal election campaigns.  Although the Act does not focus on the ideas expressed by persons or groups subject to its regulations, it is aimed in part at equalizing the relative ability of all voters to affect electoral outcomes by placing a ceiling on expenditures for political expression by citizens and groups.  Unlike <em>O\'Brien,</em> where the Selective Service System\'s administrative interest in the preservation of draft cards was wholly unrelated to their use as a means of communication, it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged "conduct" of giving or spending money "arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful."  391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#382">391 U. S. 382</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Nor can the Act\'s contribution and expenditure limitations be sustained, as some of the parties suggest, by reference to the constitutional principles reflected in such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 424 U. S. 18</a></p><p> decisions as <em>Cox v. Louisiana, supra; Adderley v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/39/case.html">385 U. S. 39</a></span> (1966); and <em>Kovacs v. Cooper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/77/case.html">336 U. S. 77</a></span> (1949).  Those cases stand for the proposition that the government may adopt reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, which do not discriminate among speakers or ideas, in order to further an important governmental interest unrelated to the restriction of communication.  <em>See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/case.html">422 U. S. 205</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/205/case.html#209">422 U. S. 209</a></span> (1975).  In contrast to <em>O\'Brien,</em> where the method of expression was held to be subject to prohibition, <em>Cox, Adderley,</em> and <em>Kovacs</em> involved place or manner restrictions on legitimate modes of expression -- picketing, parading, demonstrating, and using a sound truck.  The critical difference between this case and those time, place, and manner cases is that the present Act\'s contribution and expenditure limitations impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 424 U. S. 19</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today\'s mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate\'s increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.</p>\n<p>The expenditure limitations contained in the Act represent substantial, rather than merely theoretical, restraints on the quantity and diversity of political speech.  The $1,000 ceiling on spending "relative to a clearly identified candidate," 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), would appear to exclude all citizens and groups except candidates, political parties, and the institutional press [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] from any significant use of the most </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 424 U. S. 20</a></p><p> effective modes of communication. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Although the Act\'s limitations on expenditures by campaign organizations and political parties provide substantially greater room for discussion and debate, they would have required restrictions in the scope of a number of past congressional and Presidential campaigns [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] and would operate to constrain campaigning by candidates who raise sums in excess of the spending ceiling.</p>\n<p>By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor\'s ability to engage in free communication.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 424 U. S. 21</a></p><p> A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.  The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing.  At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor\'s support for the candidate. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\'s freedom to discuss candidates and issues.  While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.</p>\n<p>Given the important role of contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.  There is no indication, however, that the contribution limitations imposed by the Act would have any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns and political associations. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The over-all effect of the Act\'s contribution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 424 U. S. 22</a></p><p> ceilings is merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons and to compel people who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory limits to expend such funds on direct political expression, rather than to reduce the total amount of money potentially available to promote political expression.</p>\n<p>The Act\'s contribution and expenditure limitations also impinge on protected associational freedoms.  Making a contribution, like joining a political party, serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.  In addition, it enables like-minded persons to pool their resources in furtherance of common political goals.  The Act\'s contribution ceilings thus limit one important means of associating with a candidate or committee, but leave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association\'s efforts on behalf of candidates.  And the Act\'s contribution limitations permit associations and candidates to aggregate large sums of money to promote effective advocacy.  By contrast, the Act\'s $1,000 limitation on independent expenditures "relative to a clearly identified candidate" precludes most associations from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents, the original basis for the recognition of First Amendment protection of the freedom of association.  <em>See NAACP v. Alabama,</em> 357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#460">357 U. S. 460</a></span>.  The Act\'s constraints on the ability of independent associations and candidate campaign organizations to expend resources on political expression "is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of [their] adherents," <em>Sweezy v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/234/case.html">354 U.

The $1,000 Limitation on Contributions by Individuals and Groups to Candidates and Authorized Campaign Committees</p>\n<p>Section 608(b) provides, with certain limited exceptions, that</p>\n<p>"no person shall make contributions to any candidate with respect to any election for Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceed $1,000."</p>\n<p>The statute defines "person" broadly to include "an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons."  \xc2\xa7 591(g).  The limitation reaches a gift, subscription, loan, advance, deposit of anything of value, or promise to give a contribution, made for the purpose of influencing a primary election, a Presidential preference primary, or a general election for any federal office. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 591(e)(1), (2).  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 424 U.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  The restriction applies to aggregate amounts contributed to the candidate for each election -- with primaries, runoff elections, and general elections counted separately, and all Presidential primaries held in any calendar year treated together as a single election campaign.  \xc2\xa7 608(b)(5).</p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the $1,000 contribution ceiling unjustifiably burdens First Amendment freedoms, employs overbroad dollar limits, and discriminates against candidates opposing incumbent officeholders and against minor party candidates in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

According to the parties and <em>amici,</em> the primary interest served by the limitations and, indeed, by the Act as a whole, is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates\' positions and on their actions if elected to office.  Two "ancillary" interests underlying the Act are also allegedly furthered by the $1,000 limits on contributions.  First, the limits serve to mute the voices of affluent persons and groups in the election </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 424 U. S. 26</a></p><p> process and thereby to equalize the relative ability of all citizens to affect the outcome of elections. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Second, it is argued, the ceilings may to some extent act as a brake on the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns and thereby serve to open the political system more widely to candidates without access to sources of large amounts of money. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act\'s primary purpose -- to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions -- in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.  Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign.  The increasing importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass-mailing and polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy.  To the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 424 U. S. 27</a></p><p> representative democracy is undermined.  Although the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained, the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem is not an illusory one. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.  In <em>CSC v. Letter Carriers, supra,</em> the Court found that the danger to "fair and effective government" posed by partisan political conduct on the part of federal employees charged with administering the law was a sufficiently important concern to justify broad restrictions on the employees\' right of partisan political association.  Here, as there, Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence "is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent."  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html#565">413 U. S. 565</a></span>. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the contribution limitations must be invalidated because bribery laws and narrowly drawn disclosure requirements constitute a less restrictive means of dealing with "proven and suspected <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements."  But laws making criminal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 424 U. S. 28</a></p><p> the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action.  And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed.</p>\n<p>The Act\'s $1,000 contribution limitation focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions -- the narrow aspect of political association where the actuality and potential for corruption have been identified -- while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Significantly, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 424 U. S. 29</a></p><p> Act\'s contribution limitations in themselves do not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, and political parties.</p>\n<p>We find that, under the rigorous standard of review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling.</p>\n<p><em>(b)\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants\' first overbreadth challenge to the contribution ceilings rests on the proposition that most large contributors do not seek improper influence over a candidate\'s position or an officeholder\'s action.  Although the truth of that proposition may be assumed, it does not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 424 U. S. 30</a></p><p> undercut the validity of the $1,000 contribution limitation.  Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated.</p>\n<p>A second, related overbreadth claim is that the $1,000 restriction is unrealistically low because much more than that amount would still not be enough to enable an unscrupulous contributor to exercise improper influence over a candidate or officeholder, especially in campaigns for state-wide or national office.  While the contribution limitation provisions might well have been structured to take account of the graduated expenditure limitations for congressional and Presidential campaigns, [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] Congress\' failure to engage in such fine tuning does not invalidate the legislation.  As the Court of Appeals observed,</p>\n<p>"[i]f it is satisfied that some limit on contributions is necessary, a court has no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000."</p>\n<p>171 U.S.App.D.C. at 193, 519 F.2d at 842.  Such distinctions in degree become significant only when they can be said to amount to differences in kind.  <em>Compare Kusper v. Pontikes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/51/case.html">414 U. S. 51</a></span> (1973), <em>with Rosario v.

S. 752</a></span> (1973).</p>\n<p><em>(c)\n</em></p>\n<p>Apart from these First Amendment concerns, appellants argue that the contribution limitations work such an invidious discrimination between incumbents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 424 U. S. 31</a></p><p> and challengers that the statutory provisions must be declared unconstitutional on their face. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  In considering this contention, it is important at the outset to note that the Act applies the same limitations on contributions to all candidates regardless of their present occupations, ideological views, or party affiliations.  Absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.  <em>Cf. James v. Valtierra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/137/case.html">402 U. S. 137</a></span> (1971). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 424 U. S. 32</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is no such evidence to support the claim that the contribution limitations in themselves discriminate against major party challengers to incumbents.  Challengers can and often do defeat incumbents in federal elections. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Major party challengers in federal elections are usually men and women who are well known and influential in their community or State.  Often such challengers are themselves incumbents in important local, state, or federal offices.  Statistics in the record indicate that major party challengers as well as incumbents are capable of raising large sums for campaigning. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  Indeed, a small but nonetheless significant number of challengers have in recent elections outspent their incumbent rivals. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  And, to the extent that incumbents generally are more likely than challengers to attract very large contributions, the Act\'s $1,000 ceiling has the practical effect of benefiting challengers as a class. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  Contrary to the broad generalization </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 424 U. S. 33</a></p><p> drawn by the appellants, the practical impact of the contribution ceilings in any given election will clearly depend upon the amounts in excess of the ceilings that, for various reasons, the candidates in that election would otherwise have received and the utility of these additional amounts to the candidates.  To be sure, the limitations may have a significant effect on particular challengers or incumbents, but the record provides no basis for predicting that such adventitious factors will invariably and invidiously benefit incumbents as a class. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Since the danger of corruption and the appearance of corruption apply with equal force to challengers and to incumbents, Congress had ample justification for imposing the same fundraising constraints upon both.</p>\n<p>The charge of discrimination against minor party and independent candidates is more troubling, but the record provides no basis for concluding that the Act invidiously disadvantages such candidates.  As noted above, the Act, on its face treats, all candidates equally with regard to contribution limitations.  And the restriction would appear to benefit minor party and independent candidates relative to their major party opponents, because major party candidates receive far more money in large contributions. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Although there is some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="34">Page 424 U. S. 34</a></p><p> force tax appellants\' response that minor party candidates are primarily concerned with their ability to amass the resources necessary to reach the electorate, rather than with their funding position relative to their major party opponents, the record is virtually devoid of support for the claim that the $1,000 contribution limitation will have a serious effect on the initiation and scope of minor party and independent candidacies. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  Moreover, any attempt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="35">Page 424 U. S. 35</a></p><p> to exclude minor parties and independents <em>en masse</em> from the Act\'s contribution limitations overlooks the fact that minor party candidates may win elective office or have a substantial impact on the outcome of an election. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]</p>\n<p>In view of these considerations, we conclude that the impact of the Act\'s $1,000 contribution limitation on major party challengers and on minor party candidates does not render the provision unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>2. The $5,000 Limitation on Contributions by Political Committees</p>\n<p>Section 608(b)(2) permits certain committees, designated as "political committees," to contribute up to $5,000 to any candidate with respect to any election for federal office.  In order to qualify for the higher contribution ceiling, a group must have been registered with the Commission as a political committee under 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 433 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) for not less than six months, have received contributions from more than 50 persons, and, except for state political party organizations, have contributed to five or more candidates for federal office.  Appellants argue that these qualifications unconstitutionally discriminate against <em>ad hoc</em> organizations in favor of established interest groups and impermissibly burden free association.  The argument is without merit.  Rather than undermining freedom of association, the basic provision enhances the opportunity of <em>bona fide</em> groups to participate in the election process, and the registration, contribution, and candidate conditions serve the permissible purpose of preventing individuals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 424 U. S. 36</a></p><p> from evading the applicable contribution limitations by labeling themselves committees.</p>\n<p>3. Limitations on Volunteers\' Incidental Expenses</p>\n<p>The Act excludes from the definition of contribution</p>\n<p>"the value of services provided without compensation by individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 591(e)(5)(A).  Certain expenses incurred by persons in providing volunteer services to a candidate are exempt from the $1,000 ceiling only to the extent that they do not exceed $500.  These expenses are expressly limited to (1) "the use of real or personal property and the cost of invitations, food, and beverages, voluntarily provided by an individual to a candidate in rendering voluntary personal services on the individual\'s residential premises for candidate-related activities," \xc2\xa7 591(e)(5)(B); (2) "the sale of any food or beverage by a vendor for use in a candidate\'s campaign at a charge [at least equal to cost but] less than the normal comparable charge," \xc2\xa7 591(e)(5)(C); and (3) "any unreimbursed payment for travel expenses made by an individual who on his own behalf volunteers his personal services to a candidate," \xc2\xa7 591(e)(5)(D).</p>\n<p>If, as we have held, the basic contribution limitations are constitutionally valid, then surely these provisions are a constitutionally acceptable accommodation of Congress\' valid interest in encouraging citizen participation in political campaigns while continuing to guard against the corrupting potential of large financial contributions to candidates.  The expenditure of resources at the candidate\'s direction for a fundraising event at a volunteer\'s residence or the provision of in-kind assistance in the form of food or beverages to be resold to raise funds or consumed by the participants in such an event provides material financial assistance to a candidate.  The ultimate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="37">Page 424 U. S. 37</a></p><p> effect is the same as if the person had contributed the dollar amount to the candidate and the candidate had then used the contribution to pay for the fundraising event or the food.  Similarly, travel undertaken as a volunteer at the direction of the candidate or his staff is an expense of the campaign and may properly be viewed as a contribution if the volunteer absorbs the fare.  Treating these expenses as contributions when made to the candidate\'s campaign or at the direction of the candidate or his staff forecloses an avenue of abuse [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] without limiting actions voluntarily undertaken by citizens independently of a candidate\'s campaign. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 424 U. S. 38</a></p><p></p>\n<p>4. The 25,000 Limitation on Total Contributions During any Calendar Year</p>\n<p>In addition to the $1,000 limitation on the nonexempt contributions that an individual may make to a particular candidate for any single election, the Act contains an over-all $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year.  \xc2\xa7 608(b)(3).  A contribution made in connection with an election is considered, for purposes of this subsection, to be made in the year the election is held.  Although the constitutionality of this provision was drawn into question by appellants, it has not been separately addressed at length by the parties.  The over-all $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.  But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate\'s political party.  The limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the over-all ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 424 U. S. 39</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C. Expenditure Limitations\n</em></p>\n<p>The Act\'s expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech.  The most drastic of the limitations restricts individuals and groups, including political parties that fail to place a candidate on the ballot, [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>] to an expenditure of $1,000 "relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year."  \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1).  Other expenditure ceilings limit spending by candidates, \xc2\xa7 608(a), their campaigns, \xc2\xa7 608(c), and political parties in connection with election campaigns, \xc2\xa7 608(f).  It is clear that a primary effect of these expenditure limitations is to restrict the quantity of campaign speech by individuals, groups, and candidates.  The restrictions, while neutral as to the ideas expressed, limit political expression "at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms."  <em>Williams v. Rhodes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html">393 U. S. 23</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/case.html#32">393 U.

The $1,000 Limitation on Expenditures "Relative to a Clearly Identified Candidate"</p>\n<p>Section 608(e)(1) provides that</p>\n<p>"[n]o person may make any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, when added to all other expenditures made by such person during the year advocating the election or defeat of such candidate, exceeds $1,000. [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]"</p>\n<p>The plain effect of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) is to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 424 U. S. 40</a></p><p> prohibit all individuals, who are neither candidates nor owners of institutional press facilities, and all groups, except political parties and campaign organizations, from voicing their views "relative to a clearly identified candidate" through means that entail aggregate expenditures of more than $1,000 during a calendar year.  The provision, for example, would make it a federal criminal offense for a person or association to place a single one-quarter page advertisement "relative to a clearly identified candidate" in a major metropolitan newspaper. [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>Before examining the interests advanced in support of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1)\'s expenditure ceiling, consideration must be given to appellants\' contention that the provision is unconstitutionally vague. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]  Close examination of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 424 U. S. 41</a></p><p> specificity of the statutory limitation is required where, as here, the legislation imposes criminal penalties in an area permeated by First Amendment interests.  <em>See Smith v.

[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  The test is whether the language of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) affords the "[p]recision of regulation [that] must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms."  <em>NAACP v.

S. 438</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The key operative language of the provision limits "any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate."  Although "expenditure," "clearly identified," and "candidate" are defined in the Act, there is no definition clarifying what expenditures are "relative to" a candidate.  The use of so indefinite a phrase as "relative to" a candidate fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech, unless other portions of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) make sufficiently explicit the range of expenditures </p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 424 U. S. 42</a></p><p> covered by the limitation.  The section prohibits "any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year which, <em>when added to all other expenditures . . . advocation the election or defeat of such candidate,</em> exceeds $1,000."  (Emphasis added.)  This context clearly permits, if indeed it does not require, the phrase "relative to" a candidate to be read to mean "advocating the election or defeat of" a candidate. [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]</p>\n<p>But while such a construction of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) refocuses the vagueness question, the Court of Appeals was mistaken in thinking that this construction eliminates the problem of unconstitutional vagueness altogether.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 204, 519 F.2d at 853.  For the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.  Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions.  Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.

Collins</em> can be avoided only by reading \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) as limited to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate, much as the definition of "clearly identified" in \xc2\xa7 608(e)(2) requires that an explicit and unambiguous reference to the candidate appear as part of the communication. [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 424 U. S. 44</a></p><p> is the reading of the provision suggested by the nongovernmental appellees in arguing that "[f]unds spent to propagate one\'s views on issues without expressly calling for a candidate\'s election or defeat are thus not covered."  We agree that, in order to preserve the provision against invalidation on vagueness grounds, \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that, in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]</p>\n<p>We turn then to the basic First Amendment question -- whether \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1), even as thus narrowly and explicitly construed, impermissibly burdens the constitutional right of free expression.  The Court of Appeals summarily held the provision constitutionally valid on the ground that "section 608(e) is a loophole-closing provision only" that is necessary to prevent circumvention of the contribution limitations.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 204, 519 F.2d at 853.  We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>The discussion in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#14">424 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> explains why the Act\'s expenditure limitations impose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association than do its contribution limitations.  The markedly greater burden on basic freedoms caused by \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) thus cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations.  Rather, the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) turns on whether the governmental interests advanced in its support satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 424 U. S. 45</a></p><p> on core First Amendment rights of political expression.</p>\n<p>We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1)\'s ceiling on independent expenditures.  First, assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions, \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers.  Unlike the contribution limitations\' total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) prevents only some large expenditures.  So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that, in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.  The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation\'s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat, but nevertheless benefited the candidate\'s campaign.  Yet no substantial societal interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision designed to check corruption that permitted unscrupulous persons and organizations to expend unlimited sums of money in order to obtain improper influence over candidates for elective office.  <em>Cf. Mills v. Alabama,</em> 384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html#220">384 U. S. 220</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Second, quite apart from the shortcomings of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 424 U. S. 46</a></p><p> in preventing any abuses generated by large independent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions.  The parties defending \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) contend that it is necessary to prevent would-be contributors from avoiding the contribution limitations by the simple expedient of paying directly for media advertisements or for other portions of the candidate\'s campaign activities.  They argue that expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse.  Yet such controlled or coordinated expenditures are treated as contributions, rather than expenditures under the Act. [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  Section 608(b)\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 424 U. S. 47</a></p><p> contribution ceilings, rather than \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1)\'s independent expenditure limitation, prevent attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged or coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions.  By contrast, 608(e)(1) limits expenditures for express advocacy of candidates made totally independently of the candidate and his campaign.  Unlike contributions, such independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate\'s campaign, and indeed may prove counterproductive.  The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <em>quid pro quo</em> for improper commitments from the candidate.  Rather than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse.</p>\n<p>While the independent expenditure ceiling thus fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 424 U. S. 48</a></p><p> the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process, it heavily burdens core First Amendment expression.  For the First Amendment right to "<em>speak one\'s mind . . . on all public institutions\'" includes the right to engage in "`vigorous advocacy\' no less than `abstract discussion.\'"  <em>New York Times Co. v Sullivan,</em> 376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#269">376 U.

Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation. [<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]  It is argued, however, that the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections serves to justify the limitation on express advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates imposed by \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1)\'s expenditure ceiling. \xef\xbf\xbdBut the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="49">Page 424 U.

In <em>Mills,</em> the Court addressed the question whether</p>\n<p>"a State, consistently with the United States Constitution, can make it a crime for the editor of a daily newspaper to write and publish an editorial <em>on election day</em> urging people to vote a certain way on issues submitted to them."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html#215">384 U.

Yet the prohibition of election day editorials invalidated in <em>Mills</em> is clearly a lesser intrusion on constitutional freedom than a $1,000 limitation on the amount of money any person or association can spend during an entire election year in advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for public office.  More recently, in <em>Tornillo,</em> the Court held that Florida could not constitutionally require a newspaper </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 424 U.

Yet, under the Florida statute, every newspaper was free to criticize any candidate as much as it pleased so long as it undertook the modest burden of printing his reply.  <em>See</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/case.html#256">418 U.

[<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, we conclude that \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1)\'s independent expenditure limitation is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>2. Limitation on Expenditures by Candidates from Personal or Family Resources</p>\n<p>The Act also sets limits on expenditures by a candidate "from his personal funds, or the personal funds of his immediate family, in connection with his campaigns during any calendar year."  \xc2\xa7 608(a)(1).  These ceilings vary from $50,000 for Presidential or Vice Presidential candidates to $35,000 for senatorial candidates, and $25,000 for most candidates for the House of Representatives. [<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 424 U. S. 52</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The ceiling on personal expenditures by candidates on their own behalf, like the limitations on independent expenditures contained in \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1), imposes a substantial restraint on the ability of persons to engage in protected First Amendment expression. [<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  The candidate, no less than any other person, has a First Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election and the election of other candidates.  Indeed, it is of particular importance that candidates have the unfettered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 424 U. S. 53</a></p><p> opportunity to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates\' personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election day.  Mr. Justice Brandeis\' observation that, in our country "public discussion is a political duty," <em>Whitney v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/case.html">274 U. S. 357</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/case.html#375">274 U. S. 375</a></span> (1927) (concurring opinion), applies with special force to candidates for public office.  Section 608(a)\'s ceiling on personal expenditures by a candidate in furtherance of his own candidacy thus clearly and directly interferes with constitutionally protected freedoms.</p>\n<p>The primary governmental interest served by the Act -- the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process -- does not support the limitation on the candidate\'s expenditure of his own personal funds.  As the Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<p>"Manifestly, the core problem of avoiding undisclosed and undue influence on candidates from outside interests has lesser application when the monies involved come from the candidate himself or from his immediate family."</p>\n<p>171 U.S.App.D.C. at 206, 519 F.2d at 855.  Indeed, the use of personal funds reduces the candidate\'s dependence on outside contributions, and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which the Act\'s contribution limitations are directed. [<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 424 U. S. 54</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office, therefore, provides the sole relevant rationale for \xc2\xa7 608(a)\'s expenditure ceiling.  That interest is clearly not sufficient to justify the provision\'s infringement of fundamental First Amendment rights.  First, the limitation may fail to promote financial equality among candidates.  A candidate who spends less of his personal resources on his campaign may nonetheless outspend his rival as a result of more successful fundraising efforts.  Indeed, a candidate\'s personal wealth may impede his efforts to persuade others that he needs their financial contributions or volunteer efforts to conduct an effective campaign.  Second, and more fundamentally, the First Amendment simply cannot tolerate \xc2\xa7 608(a)\'s restriction upon the freedom of a candidate to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy.  We therefore hold that \xc2\xa7 608(a)\'s restriction on a candidate\'s personal expenditures is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>3. Limitations on Campaign Expenditures</p>\n<p>Section 608(c) places limitations on over-all campaign expenditures by candidates seeking nomination for election and election to federal office. [<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>]  Presidential candidates may spend $10,000,000 in seeking nomination for office, and an additional $20,000,000 in the general election campaign.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(c)(1)(A), (B). [<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 424 U. S. 55</a></p><p> The ceiling on senatorial campaigns is pegged to the size of the voting-age population of the State, with minimum dollar amounts applicable to campaigns in States with small populations.  In senatorial primary elections, the limit is the greater of eight cents multiplied by the voting-age population or $100,000, and, in the general election, the limit is increased to 12 cents multiplied by the voting-age population, or $150,000.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(c)(1)(C), (D).  The Act imposes blanket $70,000 limitations on both primary campaigns and general election campaigns for the House of Representatives, with the exception that the senatorial ceiling applies to campaigns in States entitled to only one Representative.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(c)(1)(C)(E).  These ceilings are to be adjusted upwards at the beginning of each calendar year by the average percentage rise in the consumer price index for the 12 preceding months.  \xc2\xa7 608(d). [<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]</p>\n<p>No governmental interest that has been suggested is sufficient to justify the restriction on the quantity of political expression imposed by \xc2\xa7 608(c)\'s campaign expenditure limitations.  The major evil associated with rapidly increasing campaign expenditures is the danger of candidate dependence on large contributions.  The interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by the Act\'s contribution limitations and disclosure provisions, rather than by \xc2\xa7 608(c)\'s campaign expenditure ceilings.  The Court of Appeals\' assertion that the expenditure restrictions are necessary to reduce the incentive to circumvent direct contribution limits is not persuasive.  <em>See</em> 171 U.S.App.D.C. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 424 U. S. 56</a></p><p> at 210, 519 F.2d at 859.  There is no indication that the substantial criminal penalties for violating the contribution ceilings, combined with the political repercussion of such violations, will be insufficient to police the contribution provisions.  Extensive reporting, auditing, and disclosure requirements applicable to both contributions and expenditures by political campaigns are designed to facilitate the detection of illegal contributions.  Moreover, as the Court of Appeals noted, the Act permits an officeholder or successful candidate to retain contributions in excess of the expenditure ceiling, and to use these funds for "any other lawful purpose."  2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 439a (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  This provision undercuts whatever marginal role the expenditure limitations might otherwise play in enforcing the contribution ceilings.</p>\n<p>The interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates competing for federal office is no more convincing a justification for restricting the scope of federal election campaigns.  Given the limitation on the size of outside contributions, the financial resources available to a candidate\'s campaign, like the number of volunteers recruited, will normally vary with the size and intensity of the candidate\'s support. [<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]  There is nothing invidious, improper, or unhealthy in permitting such funds to be spent to carry the candidate\'s message to the electorate. [<a href="#F64" name="T64">Footnote 64</a>]  Moreover, the equalization of permissible campaign expenditures </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 424 U. S. 57</a></p><p> might serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.</p>\n<p>The campaign expenditure ceilings appear to be designed primarily to serve the governmental interests in reducing the allegedly skyrocketing costs of political campaigns.  Appellees and the Court of Appeals stressed statistics indicating that spending for federal election campaigns increased almost 300% between 1952 and 1972 in comparison with a 57.6% rise in the consumer price index during the same period.  Appellants respond that, during these years, the rise in campaign spending lagged behind the percentage increase in total expenditures for commercial advertising and the size of the gross national product.  In any event, the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns, in and of itself, provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending and the resulting limitation on the scope of federal campaigns.  The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one\'s political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise.  In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people -- individually, as citizens and candidates, and collectively, as associations and political committees -- who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. [<a href="#F65" name="T65">Footnote 65</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 424 U. S. 58</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that \xc2\xa7 608(c) is constitutionally invalid. [<a href="#F66" name="T66">Footnote 66</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, the provisions of the Act that impose a $1,000 limitation on contributions to a single candidate, \xc2\xa7 608(b)(1), a $5,000 limitation on contributions by a political committee to a single candidate, \xc2\xa7 608(b)(2), and a $25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar year, \xc2\xa7 608(b)(3), are constitutionally valid.  These limitations, along with the disclosure provisions, constitute the Act\'s primary weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions.  The contribution ceilings thus serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.  By contrast, the First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act\'s independent expenditure ceiling, \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1), its limitation on a candidate\'s expenditures from his own personal funds, \xc2\xa7 608(a), and its ceilings on over-all campaign expenditures, \xc2\xa7 608(e).  These provisions place substantial and direct restrictions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 424 U. S. 59</a></p><p> on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate.

REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS<p></p>\n<p>Unlike the limitations on contributions and expenditures imposed by 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), the disclosure requirements of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 431 <em>et seq.</em> (1970 ed., Supp. IV), [<a href="#F68" name="T68">Footnote 68</a>] are not challenged by appellants as <em>per se</em> unconstitutional restrictions on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms of speech and association. [<a href="#F69" name="T69">Footnote 69</a>] Indeed, appellants argue that "narrowly drawn disclosure requirements are the proper solution to virtually all of the evils Congress sought to remedy."  Brief for Appellants 171.  The particular requirements </p><p><a class="page-number" name="61">Page 424 U. S. 61</a></p><p> embodied in the Act are attacked as overbroad -- both in their application to minor party and independent candidates and in their extension to contributions as small as $11 or $101.  Appellants also challenge the provision for disclosure by those who make independent contributions and expenditures, \xc2\xa7 434(e).  The Court of Appeals found no constitutional infirmities in the provisions challenged here. [<a href="#F70" name="T70">Footnote 70</a>]  We affirm the determination on overbreadth and hold that \xc2\xa7 434(e), if narrowly construed, also is within constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p>The first federal disclosure law was enacted in 1910.

It required political committees, defined as national committees and national congressional campaign committees of parties, and organizations operating to influence congressional elections in two or more States, to disclose names of all contributors of $100 or more; identification of recipients of expenditures of $10 or more was also required.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 5-6, 36 Stat. 822-824.  Annual expenditures of $50 or more "for the purpose of influencing or controlling, in two or more States, the result of" a congressional election had to be reported independently if they were not made through a political committee.  \xc2\xa7 7, 36 Stat. 824.

Although the disclosure requirements were widely circumvented, [<a href="#F71" name="T71">Footnote 71</a>] no further attempts were made to tighten them until 1960, when the Senate passed a bill that would have closed some existing loopholes.  S. 2436, 106 Cong.Rec. 1193.  The attempt aborted because no similar effort was made in the House.</p>\n<p>The Act presently under review replaced all prior disclosure laws.  Its primary disclosure provisions impose reporting obligations on "political committees" and candidates.  "Political committee" is defined in \xc2\xa7 431(d) as a group of persons that receives "contributions" or makes "expenditures" of over $1,000 in a calendar year.  "Contributions" and "expenditures" are defined in lengthy parallel provisions similar to those in Title 18, discussed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 424 U. S. 63</a></p><p> above. [<a href="#F72" name="T72">Footnote 72</a>] Both definitions focus on the use of money or other objects of value "for the purpose of . . . influencing" the nomination or election of any person to federal office.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 431(e)(1), (f)(1)</p>\n<p>Each political committee is required to register with the Commission, \xc2\xa7 433, and to keep detailed records of both contributions and expenditures, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 432(c), (d).  These records must include the name and address of everyone making a contribution in excess of $10, along with the date and amount of the contribution.  If a person\'s contributions aggregate more than $100, his occupation and principal place of business are also to be included.  \xc2\xa7 432(c)(2).  These files are subject to periodic audits and field investigations by the Commission.  \xc2\xa7 438(a)(8).</p>\n<p>Each committee and each candidate also is required to file quarterly reports. \xc2\xa7 434(a).  The reports are to contain detailed financial information, including the full name, mailing address, occupation, and principal place of business of each person who has contributed over $100 in a calendar year, as well as the amount and date of the contributions.  \xc2\xa7 434(b).  They are to be made available by the Commission "for public inspection and copying."  \xc2\xa7 438(a)(4).  Every candidate for federal office is required to designate a "principal campaign committee," which is to receive reports of contributions and expenditures made on the candidate\'s behalf from other political committees and to compile and file these reports, together with its own statements, with the Commission.  \xc2\xa7 432(f).</p>\n<p>Every individual or group, other than a political committee or candidate, who makes "contributions" or "expenditures" of over $100 in a calendar year "other than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 424 U.

General Principles\n</em></p>\n<p>Unlike the over-all limitations on contributions and expenditures, the disclosure requirements impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities.  But we have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.  <em>E.g., Gibson v. Florida Legislative Comm.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/539/case.html">372 U. S. 539</a></span> (1963); <em>NAACP v.

S. 449</a></span> (1958).</p>\n<p>We long have recognized that significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.  Since <em>NAACP v. Alabama,</em> we have required that the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scrutiny. [<a href="#F73" name="T73">Footnote 73</a>]  We also have insisted that there be a "relevant correlation" [<a href="#F74" name="T74">Footnote 74</a>] or "substantial relation" [<a href="#F75" name="T75">Footnote 75</a>] between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.  <em>See Pollard v. Roberts,</em> 283 F.Supp. 248, 257 (ED Ark.) (three-judge court), <em>aff\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/14/case.html">393 U. S. 14</a></span> (1968) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 424 U. S. 65</a></p><p> (per curiam).  This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises not through direct government action, but indirectly, as an unintended but inevitable result of the government\'s conduct in requiring disclosure.  <em>NAACP v. Alabama, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#461">357 U. S. 461</a></span>.  <em>Cf. Kusper v.

S. 57</a></span>-58.</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that the disclosure requirements of the Act differ significantly from those at issue in <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> and its progeny, because the Act only requires disclosure of the names of contributors, and does not compel political organizations to submit the names of their members. [<a href="#F76" name="T76">Footnote 76</a>]</p>\n<p>As we have seen, group association is protected because it enhances "[e]ffective advocacy."  <em>NAACP v.

The right to Join together "for the advancement of beliefs and ideas," <em>ibid.,</em> is diluted if it does not include the right to pool money through contributions, for funds are often essential if "advocacy" is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 424 U. S. 66</a></p><p> to be truly or optimally "effective."  Moreover, the invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for "[f]inancial transactions can reveal much about a person\'s activities, associations, and beliefs."  <em>California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/21/case.html">416 U. S. 21</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/21/case.html#78">416 U. S. 78</a></span>-79 (1974) (POWELL, J., concurring).  Our past decisions have not drawn fine lines between contributors and members, but have treated them interchangeably.  In <em>Bates,</em> for example, we applied the principles of <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> and reversed convictions for failure to comply with a city ordinance that required the disclosure of "dues, assessments, and contributions paid, by whom and when paid."  361 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/516/case.html#518">361 U.

S. 41</a></span> (1953) (setting aside a contempt conviction of an organization official who refused to disclose names of those who made bulk purchases of books sold by the organization).</p>\n<p>The strict test established by <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> is necessary because compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially infringing the exercise of First Amendment rights.  But we have acknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, particularly when the "free functioning of our national institutions" is involved.  <em>Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Bd.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/1/case.html">367 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/1/case.html#97">367 U. S. 97</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>The governmental interests sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of this magnitude.  They fall into three categories.  First, disclosure provides the electorate with information "as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate" [<a href="#F77" name="T77">Footnote 77</a>] in order to aid the voters in evaluating those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 424 U. S. 67</a></p><p> who seek federal office.  It allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches.  The sources of a candidate\'s financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive, and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.</p>\n<p>Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. [<a href="#F78" name="T78">Footnote 78</a>]  This exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper purposes either before or after the election.  A public armed with information about a candidate\'s most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special favors that may be given in return. [<a href="#F79" name="T79">Footnote 79</a>]  And, as we recognized in <em>Burroughs v. United States,</em> 290 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html#548">290 U. S. 548</a></span>, Congress could reasonably conclude that full disclosure during an election campaign tends "to prevent the corrupt use of money to affect elections."  In enacting these requirements, it may have been mindful of Mr. Justice Brandeis\' advice:</p>\n<p>"Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases.  Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman. [<a href="#F80" name="T80">Footnote 80</a>]"</p>\n<p>Third, and not least significant, recordkeeping, reporting, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 424 U. S. 68</a></p><p> and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations described above.</p>\n<p>The disclosure requirements, as a general matter, directly serve substantial governmental interests.  In determining whether these interests are sufficient to justify the requirements, we must look to the extent of the burden that they place on individual rights.</p>\n<p>It is undoubtedly true that public disclosure of contributions to candidates and political parties will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute.  In some instances, disclosure may even expose contributors to harassment or retaliation.  These are not insignificant burdens on individual rights, and they must be weighed carefully against the interests which Congress has sought to promote by this legislation.  In this process, we note and agree with appellants\' concession [<a href="#F81" name="T81">Footnote 81</a>] that disclosure requirements -- certainly in most applications -- appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption that Congress found to exist. [<a href="#F82" name="T82">Footnote 82</a>]  Appellants argue, however, that the balance tips against disclosure when it is required of contributors to certain parties and candidates.  We turn now to this contention.</p>\n<p><em>B. Application to Minor Parties and Independents\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the Act\'s requirements are overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 424 U. S. 69</a></p><p> parties and independent candidates because the governmental interest in this information is minimal, and the danger of significant infringement on First Amendment rights is greatly increased.</p>\n<p>1. Requisite Factual Showing</p>\n<p>In <em>NAACP v. Alabama,</em> the organization had</p>\n<p>"made an uncontroverted showing that, on past occasions, revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members [had] exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility,"</p>\n<p>357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#462">357 U. S. 462</a></span>, and the State was unable to show that the disclosure it sought had a "substantial bearing" on the issues it sought to clarify, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#464">357 U. S. 464</a></span>.  Under those circumstances, the Court held that "whatever interest the State may have in [disclosure] has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome petitioner\'s constitutional objections."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#465">357 U. S. 465</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected appellants\' suggestion that this case fits into the <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> mold.  It concluded that substantial governmental interests in "informing the electorate and preventing the corruption of the political process" were furthered by requiring disclosure of minor parties and independent candidates, 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 218, 519 F.2d at 867, and therefore found no</p>\n<p>tenable rationale for assuming that the public interest in minority party disclosure of contributions above a reasonable cutoff point is uniformly outweighed by potential contributors\' associational rights,</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 219, 519 F.2d at 868.  The court left open the question of the application of the disclosure requirements to candidates (and parties) who could demonstrate injury of the sort at stake in <em>NAACP v. Alabama.</em>  No record of harassment on a similar scale was found in this case. [<a href="#F83" name="T83">Footnote 83</a>]  We agree with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 424 U. S. 70</a></p><p> the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> is inapposite where, as here, any serious infringement on First Amendment rights brought about by the compelled disclosure of contributors is highly speculative.</p>\n<p>It is true that the governmental interest in disclosure is diminished when the contribution in question is made to a minor party with little chance of winning an election.  As minor parties usually represent definite and publicized viewpoints, there may be less need to inform the voters of the interests that specific candidates represent.  Major parties encompass candidates of greater diversity.  In many situations, the label "Republican" or "Democrat" tells a voter little.  The candidate who bears it may be supported by funds from the far right, the far left, or any place in between on the political spectrum.  It is less likely that a candidate of, say, the Socialist Labor Party will represent interests that cannot be discerned from the party\'s ideological position.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s interest in deterring the "buying" of elections and the undue influence of large contributors on officeholders also may be reduced where contributions to a minor party or an independent candidate are concerned, for it is less likely that the candidate will be victorious.  But a minor party sometimes can play a significant role in an election.  Even when a minor party candidate has little or no chance of winning, he may be encouraged by major party interests in order to divert votes from other major party contenders. [<a href="#F84" name="T84">Footnote 84</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 424 U. S. 71</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are not unmindful that the damage done by disclosure to the associational interests of the minor parties and their members and to supporters of independents could be significant.  These movements are less likely to have a sound financial base, and thus are more vulnerable to fall-offs in contributions.  In some instances, fears of reprisal may deter contributions to the point where the movement cannot survive.  The public interest also suffers if that result comes to pass, for there is a consequent reduction in the free circulation of ideas both within [<a href="#F85" name="T85">Footnote 85</a>] and without [<a href="#F86" name="T86">Footnote 86</a>] the political arena.</p>\n<p>There could well be a case, similar to those before the Court in <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> and <em>Bates,</em> where the threat to the exercise of First Amendment rights is so serious, and the state interest furthered by disclosure so insubstantial, that the Act\'s requirements cannot be constitutionally applied. [<a href="#F87" name="T87">Footnote 87</a>]  But no appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort proffered in <em>NAACP v. Alabama.</em>  Instead, appellants primarily rely on "the clearly articulated fears of individuals, well experienced in the political process."  Brief for Appellants 173.  At </p><p><a class="page-number" name="72">Page 424 U. S. 72</a></p><p> best they offer the testimony of several minor party officials that one or two persons refused to make contributions because of the possibility of disclosure. [<a href="#F88" name="T88">Footnote 88</a>]  On this record, the substantial public interest in disclosure identified by the legislative history of this Act outweighs the harm generally alleged.</p>\n<p>2. Blanket Exemption</p>\n<p>Appellants agree that "the record here does not reflect the kind of focused and insistent harassment of contributors and members that existed in the NAACP cases."  <em>Ibid.</em>  They argue, however, that a blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary lest irreparable injury be done before the required evidence can be gathered.</p>\n<p>Those parties that would be sufficiently "minor" to be exempted from the requirements of \xc2\xa7 434 could be defined, appellants suggest, along the lines used for public financing purposes, <em>see</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#86">424 U. S. </a></span> <em>infra,</em> as those who received less than 25% of the vote in past elections.  Appellants do not argue that this line is constitutionally required.  They suggest as an alternative defining "minor parties" as those that do not qualify for automatic ballot access under state law.  Presumably, other criteria, such as current political strength (measured by polls or petition), age, or degree of organization, could also be used. [<a href="#F89" name="T89">Footnote 89</a>]</p>\n<p>The difficulty with these suggestions is that they reflect only a party\'s past or present political strength, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 424 U. S. 73</a></p><p> that is only one of the factors that must be considered.  Some of the criteria are not precisely indicative of even that factor.  Age, [<a href="#F90" name="T90">Footnote 90</a>] or past political success, for instance, may typically be associated with parties that have a high probability of success.  But not all long-established parties are winners -- some are consistent losers -- and a new party may garner a great deal of support if it can associate itself with an issue that has captured the public\'s imagination.  None of the criteria suggested is precisely related to the other critical factor that must be considered, the possibility that disclosure will impinge upon protected associational activity.</p>\n<p>An opinion dissenting in part from the Court of Appeals\' decision concedes that no one line is "constitutionally required." [<a href="#F91" name="T91">Footnote 91</a>]  It argues, however, that a flat exemption for minor parties must be carved out, even along arbitrary lines, if groups that would suffer impermissibly from disclosure are to be given any real protection.  An approach that requires minor parties to submit evidence that the disclosure requirements cannot constitutionally be applied to them offers only an illusory safeguard, the argument goes, because the "evils" of "chill and harassment . . . are largely incapable of formal proof." [<a href="#F92" name="T92">Footnote 92</a>]  This dissent expressed its concern that a minor party, particularly a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 424 U. S. 74</a></p><p> new party, may never be able to prove a substantial threat of harassment, however real that threat may be, because it would be required to come forward with witnesses who are too fearful to contribute but not too fearful to testify about their fear.  A strict requirement that chill and harassment be directly attributable to the specific disclosure from which the exemption is sought would make the task even more difficult.</p>\n<p>We recognize that unduly strict requirements of proof could impose a heavy burden, but it does not follow that a blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary.  Minor parties must be allowed sufficient flexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair consideration of their claim.  The evidence offered need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party\'s contributors\' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.  The proof may include, for example, specific evidence of past or present harassment of members due to their associational ties, or of harassment directed against the organization itself.  A pattern of threats or specific manifestations of public hostility may be sufficient.  New parties that have no history upon which to draw may be able to offer evidence of reprisals and threats directed against individuals or organizations holding similar views.</p>\n<p>Where it exists, the type of chill and harassment identified in <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> can be shown.  We cannot assume that courts will be insensitive to similar showings when made in future cases.  We therefore conclude that a blanket exemption is not required.</p>\n<p><em>C. Section 434(e)\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 434(e) requires "[e]very person (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes contributions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 424 U. S. 75</a></p><p> or expenditures" aggregating over $100 in a calendar year "other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate" to file a statement with the Commission. [<a href="#F93" name="T93">Footnote 93</a>]  Unlike the other disclosure provisions, this section does not seek the contribution list of any association.  Instead, it requires direct disclosure of what an individual or group contributes or spends.</p>\n<p>In considering this provision, we must apply the same strict standard of scrutiny, for the right of associational privacy developed in <em>NAACP v. Alabama</em> derives from the rights of the organization\'s members to advocate their personal points of view in the most effective way.  357 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#458">357 U.

The Role of \xc2\xa7 434(e)</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals upheld \xc2\xa7 434(e) as necessary to enforce the independent expenditure ceiling imposed by 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  It</p>\n<p>"If . . . Congress has both the authority and a compelling interest to regulate independent expenditures under section 608(e), surely it can require that there be disclosure to prevent misuse of the spending channel."</p>\n<p>171 U.S.App.D.C. at 220 519 F.2d at 869.  We have found that \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) unconstitutionally in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 424 U. S. 76</a></p><p> fringes upon First Amendment rights. [<a href="#F94" name="T94">Footnote 94</a>]  If the sole function of \xc2\xa7 434(e) were to aid in the enforcement of that provision, it would no longer serve any governmental purpose.</p>\n<p>But the two provisions are not so intimately tied.  The legislative history on the function of \xc2\xa7 434(e) is bare, but it was clearly intended to stand independently of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1).  It was enacted with the general disclosure provisions in 1971 as part of the original Act, [<a href="#F95" name="T95">Footnote 95</a>] while \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) was part of the 1974 amendments. [<a href="#F96" name="T96">Footnote 96</a>]  Like the other disclosure provisions, \xc2\xa7 434(e) could play a role in the enforcement of the expanded contribution and expenditure limitations included in the 1974 amendments, but it also has independent functions.  Section 434(e) is part of Congress\' effort to achieve "total disclosure" by reaching "every kind of political activity" [<a href="#F97" name="T97">Footnote 97</a>] in order to insure that the voters are fully informed and to achieve through publicity the maximum deterrence to corruption and undue influence possible.  The provision is responsive to the legitimate fear that efforts would be made, as they had been in the past, [<a href="#F98" name="T98">Footnote 98</a>] to avoid the disclosure requirements by routing financial support of candidates through avenues not explicitly covered by the general provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p>2. Vagueness Problems</p>\n<p>In its effort to be all-inclusive, however, the provision raises serious problems of vagueness, particularly treacherous where, as here, the violation of its terms carries criminal penalties [<a href="#F99" name="T99">Footnote 99</a>] and fear of incurring these sanctions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 424 U. S. 77</a></p><p> may deter those who seek to exercise protected First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>Section 434(e) applies to "[e]very person. . . who makes contributions or expenditures."  "Contributions" and "expenditures" are defined in parallel provisions in terms of the use of money or other valuable assets "for the purpose of . . . influencing" the nomination or election of candidates for federal office. [<a href="#F100" name="T100">Footnote 100</a>]  It is the ambiguity of this phrase that poses constitutional problems.</p>\n<p>Due process requires that a criminal statute provide adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct is illegal, for "no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed."  <em>United States v.

It appears to have been adopted without comment from earlier disclosure Acts.

S. 45</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In enacting the legislation under review, Congress addressed broadly the problem of political campaign financing.  It wished to promote full disclosure of campaign-oriented spending to insure both the reality and the appearance of the purity and openness of the federal election process. [<a href="#F102" name="T102">Footnote 102</a>]  Our task is to construe "for the purpose of . . . influencing," incorporated in \xc2\xa7 434(e) through the definitions of "contributions" and "expenditures," in a manner that precisely furthers this goal.</p>\n<p>In  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#12">424 U. S. </a></span> we discussed what constituted a "contribution" for purposes of the contribution limitations set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [<a href="#F103" name="T103">Footnote 103</a>]  We construed that term to include not only contributions made directly or indirectly to a candidate, political party, or campaign committee, and contributions made to other organizations or individuals but earmarked for political purposes, but also all expenditures placed in cooperation with or with the consent of a candidate, his agents, or an authorized committee of the candidate.  The definition of "contribution" in \xc2\xa7 431(e), for disclosure purposes, parallels the definition in Title 18 almost word for word, and we construe the former provision as we have the latter.  So defined, "contributions" have a sufficiently close relationship to the goals of the Act, for they are connected with a candidate or his campaign.</p>\n<p>When we attempt to define "expenditure" in a similarly narrow way, we encounter line-drawing problems </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 424 U. S. 79</a></p><p> of the sort we faced in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Although the phrase, "for the purpose of . . . influencing" an election or nomination, differs from the language used in \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1), it shares the same potential for encompassing both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result. [<a href="#F104" name="T104">Footnote 104</a>]  The general requirement that "political committees" and candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar vagueness problems, for "political committee" is defined only in terms of amount of annual "contributions" and "expenditures," [<a href="#F105" name="T105">Footnote 105</a>] and could be interpreted to reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion.  The lower courts have construed the words "political committee" more narrowly. [<a href="#F106" name="T106">Footnote 106</a>]  To fulfill the purposes of the Act, they need only encompass organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.  Expenditures of candidates and of "political committees," so construed, can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be addressed by Congress.  They are, by definition, campaign-related.</p>\n<p>But when the maker of the expenditure is not within these categories -- when it is an individual other than a candidate or a group other than a "political committee" [<a href="#F107" name="T107">Footnote 107</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 424 U. S. 80</a></p><p> -- the relation of the information sought to the purposes of the Act may be too remote.  To insure that the reach of \xc2\xa7 434(e) is not impermissibly broad, we construe "expenditure" for purposes of that section in the same way we construed the terms of \xc2\xa7 608(e) -- to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate [<a href="#F108" name="T108">Footnote 108</a>] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.  This reading is directed precisely to that spending that is unambiguously related to the campaign of a particular federal candidate.</p>\n<p>In summary, \xc2\xa7 434(e), as construed, imposes independent reporting requirements on individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances:  (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.</p>\n<p>Unlike 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), \xc2\xa7 434(e), as construed, bears a sufficient relationship to a substantial governmental interest.  As narrowed, \xc2\xa7 434(e), like \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1), does not reach all partisan discussion, for it only requires disclosure of those expenditures that expressly advocate a particular election result.  This might have been fatal if the only purpose of \xc2\xa7 434(e) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 424 U. S. 81</a></p><p> were to stem corruption or its appearance by closing a loophole in the general disclosure requirements.  But the disclosure provisions, including \xc2\xa7 434(e), serve another, informational interest, and, even as construed, \xc2\xa7 434(e) increases the fund of information concerning those who support the candidates.  It goes beyond the general disclosure requirements to shed the light of publicity on spending that is unambiguously campaign-related, but would not otherwise be reported because it takes the form of independent expenditures or of contributions to an individual or group not itself required to report the names of its contributors.  By the same token, it is not fatal that \xc2\xa7 434(e) encompasses purely independent expenditures uncoordinated with a particular candidate or his agent.  The corruption potential of these expenditures may be significantly different, but the informational interest can be as strong as it is in coordinated spending, for disclosure helps voters to define more of the candidates\' constituencies.</p>\n<p>Section 434(e), as we have construed it, does not contain the infirmities of the provisions before the Court in <em>Talley v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/60/case.html">362 U. S. 60</a></span> (1960), and <em>Thomas v. Collins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/516/case.html">323 U. S. 516</a></span> (1945).  The ordinance found wanting in <em>Talley</em> forbade all distribution of handbills that did not contain the name of the printer, author, or manufacturer, and the name of the distributor.  The city urged that the ordinance was aimed at identifying those responsible for fraud, false advertising, and libel, but the Court found that it was "in no manner so limited."  362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/60/case.html#64">362 U. S. 64</a></span>.  Here, as we have seen, the disclosure requirement is narrowly limited to those situations where the information sought has a substantial connection with the governmental interests sought to be advanced.  <em>Thomas</em> held unconstitutional a prior restraint in the form of a registration requirement for labor organizers.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 424 U. S. 82</a></p><p> The Court found the State\'s interest insufficient to justify the restrictive effect of the statute.  The burden imposed by \xc2\xa7 434(e) is no prior restraint, but a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First Amendment values by opening the basic processes of our federal election system to public view. [<a href="#F109" name="T109">Footnote 109</a>]</p>\n<p><em>D. Thresholds\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants\' third contention, based on alleged overbreadth, is that the monetary thresholds in the recordkeeping and reporting provisions lack a substantial nexus with the claimed governmental interests, for the amounts involved are too low even to attract the attention of the candidate, much less have a corrupting influence.</p>\n<p>The provisions contain two thresholds.  Records are to be kept by political committees of the names and addresses of those who make contributions in excess of $10, \xc2\xa7 432(c)(2), and these records are subject to Commission audit, \xc2\xa7 438(a)(8).  If a person\'s contributions to a committee or candidate aggregate more than $100, his name and address, as well as his occupation and principal place of business, are to be included in reports filed by committees and candidates with the Commission, \xc2\xa7 434(b)(2), and made available for public inspection, \xc2\xa7 438(a)(4).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals rejected appellants\' contention that these thresholds are unconstitutional.  It found the challenge on First Amendment grounds to the $10 threshold to be premature, for it could "discern no basis in the statute for authorizing disclosure outside the Commission . . . ; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 424 U. S. 83</a></p><p> and hence no substantial <em>inhibitory effect\' operating upon" appellants.  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 216, 519 F.2d at 865.  The $100 threshold was found to be within the "reasonable latitude" given the legislature "as to where to draw the line."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We agree.\n</em></p>\n<p>The $10 and $100 thresholds are indeed low.  Contributors of relatively small amounts are likely to be especially sensitive to recording or disclosure of their political preferences.  These strict requirements may well discourage participation by some citizens in the political process, a result that Congress hardly could have intended.  Indeed, there is little in the legislative history to indicate that Congress focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require recording and disclosure.  Rather, it seems merely to have adopted the thresholds existing in similar disclosure laws since 1910. [<a href="#F110" name="T110">Footnote 110</a>]  But we cannot require Congress to establish that it has chosen the highest reasonable threshold.  The line is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left in the context of this complex legislation to congressional discretion.  We cannot say, on this bare record, that the limits designated are wholly without rationality. [<a href="#F111" name="T111">Footnote 111</a>]</p>\n<p>We are mindful that disclosure serves informational functions, as well as the prevention of corruption and the enforcement of the contribution limitations.  Congress is not required to set a threshold that is tailored only to the latter goals.  In addition, the enforcement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 424 U. S. 84</a></p><p> goal can never be well served if the threshold is so high that disclosure becomes equivalent to admitting violation of the contribution limitations.</p>\n<p>The $10 recordkeeping threshold, in a somewhat similar fashion, facilitates the enforcement of the disclosure provisions by making it relatively difficult to aggregate secret contributions in amounts that surpass the $100 limit.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that there is no warrant for assuming that public disclosure of contributions between $10 and $100 is authorized by the Act.  Accordingly, we do not reach the question whether information concerning gifts of this size can be made available to the public without trespassing impermissibly on First Amendment rights.  <em>Cf.

[<a href="#F112" name="T112">Footnote 112</a>]</p>\n<p>In summary, we find no constitutional infirmities in the recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure provisions of the Act.

PUBLIC FINANCING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS<p></p>\n<p>A series of statutes [<a href="#F114" name="T114">Footnote 114</a>] for the public financing of Presidential election campaigns produced the scheme now found in \xc2\xa7 6096 and Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="86">Page 424 U. S. 86</a></p><p> Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6096, 9001-9012, 9031-9042 (1970 ed., Supp. IV). [<a href="#F115" name="T115">Footnote 115</a>]  Both the District Court, 401 F.Supp. 1235, and the Court of Appeals, 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 229-238, 519 F.2d at 878-887, sustained Subtitle H against a constitutional attack. [<a href="#F116" name="T116">Footnote 116</a>]  Appellants renew their challenge here, contending that the legislation violates the First and Fifth Amendments.  We find no merit in their claims and affirm.</p>\n<p><em>A. Summary of Subtitle H\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 9006 establishes a Presidential Election Campaign Fund (Fund), financed from general revenues in the aggregate amount designated by individual taxpayers, under \xc2\xa7 6096, who on their income tax returns may authorize payment to the Fund of one dollar of their tax liability in the case of an individual return or two dollars in the case of a joint return.  The Fund consists of three separate accounts to finance (1) party nominating conventions, \xc2\xa7 9008(a), (2) general election campaigns, \xc2\xa7 9006(a), and (3) primary campaigns, \xc2\xa7 9037(a). [<a href="#F117" name="T117">Footnote 117</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="87">Page 424 U. S. 87</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Chapter 95 of Title 26 which concerns financing of party nominating conventions and general election campaigns, distinguishes among "major," "minor," and "new" parties.  A major party is defined as a party whose candidate for President in the most recent election received 25% or more of the popular vote.  \xc2\xa7 9002(6).  A minor party is defined as a party whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the vote at the most recent election.  \xc2\xa7 9002(7).  All other parties are new parties, \xc2\xa7 9002(8), including both newly created parties and those receiving less than 5% of the vote in the last election. [<a href="#F118" name="T118">Footnote 118</a>]</p>\n<p>Major parties are entitled to $2,000,000 to defray their national committee Presidential nominating convention expenses, must limit total expenditures to that amount, \xc2\xa7 9008(d), [<a href="#F119" name="T119">Footnote 119</a>] and may not use any of this money to benefit a particular candidate or delegate, \xc2\xa7 9008(c).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="88">Page 424 U. S. 88</a></p><p> A minor party receives a portion of the major party entitlement determined by the ratio of the votes received by the party\'s candidate in the last election to the average of the votes received by the major parties\' candidates.  \xc2\xa7 9008(b)(2).  The amounts given to the parties and the expenditure limit are adjusted for inflation, using 1974 as the base year.  \xc2\xa7 9008(b)(5).  No financing is provided for new parties, nor is there any express provision for financing independent candidates or parties not holding a convention.</p>\n<p>For expenses in the general election campaign, \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(1) entitles each major party candidate to $20,000,000. [<a href="#F120" name="T120">Footnote 120</a>]  This amount is also adjusted for inflation.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(1).  To be eligible for funds the candidate [<a href="#F121" name="T121">Footnote 121</a>] must pledge not to incur expenses in excess of the entitlement under \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(1) and not to accept private contributions except to the extent that the fund is insufficient to provide the full entitlement.  \xc2\xa7 9003(b).  Minor party candidates are also entitled to funding, again based on the ratio of the vote received by the party\'s candidate in the preceding election to the average of the major party candidates.  \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(2)(A). Minor party candidates must certify that they will not incur campaign expenses in excess of the major party entitlement and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="89">Page 424 U. S. 89</a></p><p> that they will accept private contributions only to the extent needed to make up the difference between that amount and the public funding grant.  \xc2\xa7 9003(c).  New party candidates receive no money prior to the general election, but any candidate receiving 5% or more of the popular vote in the election is entitled to post-election payments according to the formula applicable to minor party candidates.  \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(3).  Similarly, minor party candidates are entitled to post-election funds if they receive a greater percentage of the average major party vote than their party\'s candidate did in the preceding election; the amount of such payments is the difference between the entitlement based on the preceding election and that based on the actual vote in the current election.  \xc2\xa7 9004(a)(3).  A further eligibility requirement for minor and new party candidates is that the candidate\'s name must appear on the ballot, or electors pledged to the candidate must be on the ballot, in at least 10 States.  \xc2\xa7 9002(2)(b).</p>\n<p>Chapter 96 establishes a third account in the Fund, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account.  \xc2\xa7 9037(a).  This funding is intended to aid campaigns by candidates seeking Presidential nomination "by a political party," \xc2\xa7 9033(b)(2), in "primary elections," \xc2\xa7 9032(7). [<a href="#F122" name="T122">Footnote 122</a>]  The threshold eligibility requirement is that the candidate raise at least $5,000 in each of 20 States, counting only the first $250 from each person contributing to the candidate.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9033(b)(3), (4).  In addition, the candidate must agree to abide by the spending limits in \xc2\xa7 9035.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 9033(b)(1). [<a href="#F123" name="T123">Footnote 123</a>]  Funding is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 424 U. S. 90</a></p><p> provided according to a matching formula:  each qualified candidate is entitled to a sum equal to the total private contributions received, disregarding contributions from any person to the extent that total contributions to the candidate by that person exceed $250.  \xc2\xa7 9034(a).  Payments to any candidate under Chapter 96 may not exceed 50% of the over-all expenditure ceiling accepted by the candidate. \xc2\xa7 9034(b).</p>\n<p><em>B. Constitutionality of Subtitle H\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants argue that Subtitle H is invalid (1) as "contrary to the <em>general welfare,\'" Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, (2) because any scheme of public financing of election campaigns is inconsistent with the First Amendment, and (3) because Subtitle H invidiously discriminates against certain interests in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We find no merit in these contentions.\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants\' "general welfare" contention erroneously treats the General Welfare Clause as a limitation upon congressional power.  It is rather a grant of power, the scope of which is quite expansive, particularly in view of the enlargement of power by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">M\'Culloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#420">17 U. S. 420</a></span> (1819).  Congress has power to regulate Presidential elections and primaries, <em>United States v. Classic,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/299/case.html">313 U. S. 299</a></span> (1941); <em>Burroughs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html">290 U. S. 534</a></span> (1934); and public financing of Presidential elections as a means to reform the electoral process was clearly a choice within the granted power.  It is for Congress to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare:</p>\n<p>"[T]he power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 424 U. S. 91</a></p><p> limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Butler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/1/case.html">297 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/1/case.html#66">297 U. S. 66</a></span> (1936).  <em>See Helvering v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/619/case.html">301 U. S. 619</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/619/case.html#640">301 U. S. 640</a></span>-641 (1937).  Any limitations upon the exercise of that granted power must be found elsewhere in the Constitution.  In this case, Congress was legislating for the "general welfare" -- to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process, to facilitate communication by candidates with the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 9689, pp. 1-10 (1974).  Whether the chosen means appear "bad," "unwise," or "unworkable" to us is irrelevant; Congress has concluded that the means are "necessary and proper" to promote the general welfare, and we thus decline to find this legislation without the grant of power in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8.</p>\n<p>Appellants\' challenge to the dollar check-off provision (\xc2\xa7 6096) fails for the same reason.  They maintain that Congress is required to permit taxpayers to designate particular candidates or parties as recipients of their money.  But the appropriation to the Fund in \xc2\xa7 9006 is like any other appropriation from the general revenue except that its amount is determined by reference to the aggregate of the one- and two-dollar authorization on taxpayers\' income tax returns.  This detail does not constitute the appropriation any less an appropriation by Congress. [<a href="#F124" name="T124">Footnote 124</a>]  The fallacy of appellants\' argument is therefore apparent; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 424 U. S. 92</a></p><p> every appropriation made by Congress uses public money in a manner to which some taxpayers object. [<a href="#F125" name="T125">Footnote 125</a>]  Appellants next argue that, "by analogy" to the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, public financing of election campaigns, however meritorious, violates the First Amendment.  We have, of course, held that the Religion Clauses -- "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" -- require Congress, and the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, to remain neutral in matters of religion.  <em>E.g., Abington School Dist. v. Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html#222">374 U. S. 222</a></span>-226 (1963).  The government may not aid one religion to the detriment of others or impose a burden on one religion that is not imposed on others, and may not even aid all religions.  <em>E.g., Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#15">330 U. S. 15</a></span>-16 (1947).  <em>See</em> Kurland, Of Church and State and the Supreme Court, 29 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 96 (1961).  But the analogy is patently inapplicable to our issue here.  Although "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," Subtitle H is a congressional effort not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="93">Page 424 U. S. 93</a></p><p> discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a self-governing people. [<a href="#F126" name="T126">Footnote 126</a>]  Thus, Subtitle H furthers, not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values. [<a href="#F127" name="T127">Footnote 127</a>]  Appellants argue, however, that as constructed public financing invidiously discriminates in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

These were, of course, direct burdens not only on the candidate\'s ability to run for office, but also on the voter\'s ability to voice preferences regarding representative government and contemporary issues.  In contrast, the denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters\' rights and less restrictive of candidates\'. [<a href="#F128" name="T128">Footnote 128</a>]  Subtitle H does not prevent any candidate from getting on the ballot or any voter from casting a vote for the candidate of his choice; the inability, if any, of minor party candidates to wage effective campaigns will derive not from lack of public funding but from their inability to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 424 U. S. 95</a></p><p> raise private contributions.  Any disadvantage suffered by operation of the eligibility formulae under Subtitle H is thus limited to the claimed denial of the enhancement of opportunity to communicate with the electorate that the formulae afford eligible candidates.  But eligible candidates suffer a countervailing denial.  As we more fully develop later, acceptance of public financing entails voluntary acceptance of an expenditure ceiling.  Noneligible candidates are not subject to that limitation. [<a href="#F129" name="T129">Footnote 129</a>]  Accordingly, we conclude that public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the ballot-access regulations dealt with in prior cases. [<a href="#F130" name="T130">Footnote 130</a>]  In any event, Congress enacted Subtitle H in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests and has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 424 U. S. 96</a></p><p> not unfairly or unnecessarily burdened the political opportunity of any party or candidate.</p>\n<p>It cannot be gainsaid that public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.  S.Rep. No. 93-689, pp. 4-5 (1974).  In addition, the limits on contributions necessarily increase the burden of fundraising, and Congress properly regarded public financing as an appropriate means of relieving major party Presidential candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions.  <em>See id.</em> at 5.  The States have also been held to have important interests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support.  <em>E.g., Storer v.

Congress\' interest in not funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money, S.Rep. No. 93-689, <em>supra</em> at 7, necessarily justifies the withholding of public assistance from candidates without significant public support.  Thus, Congress may legitimately require "some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support," <em>Jenness v. Fortson, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html#442">403 U. S. 442</a></span>, as an eligibility requirement for public funds.  This requirement also serves the important public interest against providing artificial incentives to "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism."  <em>Storer v.

General Election Campaign Financing</p>\n<p>Appellants insist that Chapter 95 falls short of the constitutional requirement in that its provisions supply larger, and equal, sums to candidates of major parties, use prior vote levels as the sole criterion for pre-election funding, limit new party candidates to post-election funds, and deny any funds to candidates of parties receiving less than 5% of the vote.  These provisions, it is argued, are fatal to the validity of the scheme, because they work invidious discrimination against minor and new parties in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  We disagree. [<a href="#F131" name="T131">Footnote 131</a>]</p>\n<p>As conceded by appellants, the Constitution does not require Congress to treat all declared candidates the same for public financing purposes.  As we said in <em>Jenness v. Fortson,</em></p>\n<p>"there are obvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a political party with historically established broad support, on the one hand, and a new or small political organization on the other. . . .  Sometimes the grossest discrimination can lie in treating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 424 U. S. 98</a></p><p> things that are different as though they were exactly alike, a truism well illustrated in <em>Williams v. Rhodes, supra.</em>"</p>\n<p>403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html#441">403 U. S. 441</a></span>-442.  Since the Presidential elections of 1856 and 1860, when the Whigs were replaced as a major party by the Republicans, no third party has posed a credible threat to the two major parties in Presidential elections. [<a href="#F132" name="T132">Footnote 132</a>]  Third parties have been completely incapable of matching the major parties\' ability to raise money and win elections.  Congress was, of course, aware of this fact of American life, and thus was justified in providing both major parties full funding and all other parties only a percentage of the major party entitlement. [<a href="#F133" name="T133">Footnote 133</a>]  Identical treatment of all parties, on the other hand, "would not only make it easy to raid the United States Treasury, it would also artificially foster the proliferation of splinter parties."  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 231, 519 F.2d at 881.  The Constitution does not require the Government to "finance the efforts of every nascent political group," <em>American Party of Texas v. White,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/767/case.html#794">415 U. S. 794</a></span>, merely because Congress chose to finance the efforts of the major parties.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, appellants have made no showing that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 424 U. S. 99</a></p><p> the election funding plan disadvantages nonmajor parties by operating to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.  First, such parties are free to raise money from private sources, [<a href="#F134" name="T134">Footnote 134</a>] and, by our holding today, new parties are freed from any expenditure limits, although admittedly those limits may be a largely academic matter to them.  But since any major party candidate accepting public financing of a campaign voluntarily assents to a spending ceiling, other candidates will be able to spend more in relation to the major party candidates.  The relative position of minor parties that do qualify to receive some public funds because they received 5% of the vote in the previous Presidential election is also enhanced.  Public funding for candidates of major parties is intended as a substitute for private contributions; but for minor party candidates [<a href="#F135" name="T135">Footnote 135</a>] such assistance may be viewed as a supplement to private contributions since these candidates may continue to solicit private funds up to the applicable spending limit.  Thus, we conclude that the general election funding system does not work an invidious discrimination against candidates of nonmajor parties.</p>\n<p>Appellants challenge reliance on the vote in past elections as the basis for determining eligibility.  That challenge is foreclosed, however, by our holding in <em>Jenness v. Fortson,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html#439">403 U. S. 439</a></span>-440, that popular vote totals in the last election are a proper measure of public support.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="100">Page 424 U. S. 100</a></p><p> And Congress was not obliged to select instead from among appellants\' suggested alternatives.  Congress could properly regard the means chosen as preferable, since the alternative of petition drives presents cost and administrative problems in validating signatures, and the alternative of opinion polls might be thought inappropriate, since it would involve a Government agency in the business of certifying polls or conducting its own investigation of support for various candidates, in addition to serious problems with reliability. [<a href="#F136" name="T136">Footnote 136</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants next argue, relying on the ballot access decisions of this Court, that the absence of any alternative means of obtaining pre-election funding renders the scheme unjustifiably restrictive of minority political interests.  Appellants\' reliance on the ballot access decisions is misplaced.  To be sure, the regulation sustained in <em>Jenness v. Fortson,</em> for example, incorporated alternative means of qualifying for the ballot, 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html#440">403 U. S. 440</a></span>, and the lack of an alternative was a defect in the scheme struck down in <em>Lubin v. Panish,</em> 415 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/case.html#718">415 U. S. 718</a></span>.  To </p><p><a class="page-number" name="101">Page 424 U. S. 101</a></p><p> suggest, however, that the constitutionality of Subtitle H therefore hinges solely on whether some alternative is afforded overlooks the rationale of the operative constitutional principles.  Our decisions finding a need for an alternative means turn on the nature and extent of the burden imposed in the absence of available alternatives.  We have earlier stated our view that Chapter 95 is far less burdensome upon and restrictive of constitutional rights than the regulations involved in the ballot access cases.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#94">424 U. S. 94</a></span>-95.  Moreover, expenditure limits for major parties and candidates may well improve the chances of nonmajor parties and their candidates to receive funds and increase their spending.  Any risk of harm to minority interests is speculative due to our present lack of knowledge of the practical effects of public financing and cannot overcome the force of the governmental interests against use of public money to foster frivolous candidacies, create a system of splintered parties, and encourage unrestrained factionalism.</p>\n<p>Appellants\' reliance on the alternative means analyses of the ballot access cases generally fails to recognize a significant distinction from the instant case.  The primary goal of all candidates is to carry on a successful campaign by communicating to the voters persuasive reasons for electing them.  In some of the ballot access cases, the States afforded candidates alternative means for qualifying for the ballot, a step in any campaign that, with rare exceptions, is essential to successful effort.  Chapter 95 concededly provides only one method of obtaining pre-election financing; such funding is, however, not as necessary as being on the ballot.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F128" name="T128">n</a> 128, <em>supra.</em>  Plainly, campaigns can be successfully carried out by means other than public financing; they have been up to this date, and this avenue is still open to all candidates.  And, after all, the important achievements of minority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 424 U. S. 102</a></p><p> political groups in furthering the development of American democracy [<a href="#F137" name="T137">Footnote 137</a>] were accomplished without the help of public funds.  Thus, the limited participation or nonparticipation of nonmajor parties or candidates in public funding does not unconstitutionally disadvantage them.</p>\n<p>Of course, nonmajor parties and their candidates may qualify for post-election participation in public funding and in that sense the claimed discrimination is not total.  Appellants contend, however that the benefit of any such participation is illusory due to \xc2\xa7 9004(c), which bars the use of the money for any purpose other than paying campaign expenses or repaying loans that had been used to defray such expenses.  The only meaningful use for post-election funds is thus to repay loans; but loans, except from national banks, are "contributions" subject to the general limitations on contributions, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 591(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Further, they argue, loans are not readily available to nonmajor parties or candidates before elections to finance their campaigns.  Availability of post-election funds therefore assertedly gives them nothing.  But, in the nature of things, the willingness of lenders to make loans will depend upon the pre-election probability that the candidate and his party will attract 5% or more of the voters.  When a reasonable prospect of such support appears, the party and candidate may be an acceptable loan risk, since the prospect of post-election participation in public funding will be good. [<a href="#F138" name="T138">Footnote 138</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 424 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, appellants challenge the validity of the 50% threshold requirement for general election funding.  They argue that, since most state regulations governing ballot access have threshold requirements well below 50%, and because, in their view, the 50% requirement here is actually stricter than that upheld in <em>Jenness v. Fortson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html">403 U. S. 431</a></span> (1971), [<a href="#F139" name="T139">Footnote 139</a>] the requirement is unreasonable.  We have already concluded that the restriction under Chapter 95 is generally less burdensome than ballot access regulations.  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#94">424 U. S. 94</a></span>-95.  Further, the Georgia provision sustained in <em>Jenness</em> required the candidate to obtain the signatures of 70% of all eligible voters, without regard to party.  To be sure, the public funding formula does not permit anyone who voted for another party in the last election to be part of a candidate\'s 5%.  But, under Chapter 95, a Presidential candidate needs only 5% or more of the actual vote, not the larger universe of eligible voters.  As a result, we cannot say that Chapter 95 is numerically more, or less, restrictive than the regulation in <em>Jenness.</em>  In any event, the choice of the percentage requirement that best accommodates the competing interests involved was for Congress to make.  <em>See Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/32/case.html">277 U. S. 32</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/32/case.html#41">277 U. S. 41</a></span> (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting);  <a href="#F111" name="T111">n</a> 111, <em>supra.</em>  Without any doubt, a range of formulations would sufficiently protect the public fisc and not foster factionalism, and would also recognize the public interest in the fluidity of our political </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 424 U. S. 104</a></p><p> affairs:  we cannot say that Congress\' choice falls without the permissible range. [<a href="#F140" name="T140">Footnote 140</a>]</p>\n<p>2. Nominating Convention Financing</p>\n<p>The foregoing analysis and reasoning sustaining general election funding apply in large part to convention funding under Chapter 95 and suffice to support our rejection of appellants\' challenge to these provisions.  Funding of party conventions has increasingly been derived from large private contributions, <em>see</em> H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 14 (1974), and the governmental interest in eliminating this reliance is as vital as in the case of private contributions to individual candidates.  The expenditure limitations on major parties participating in public financing enhance the ability of nonmajor parties to increase their spending relative to the major parties; further, in soliciting private contributions to finance conventions, parties are not subject to the $1,000 contribution limit pertaining to candidates. [<a href="#F141" name="T141">Footnote 141</a>]  We therefore conclude that appellants\' constitutional challenge to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 424 U. S. 105</a></p><p> provisions for funding nominating conventions must also be rejected.</p>\n<p>3. Primary Election Campaign Financing</p>\n<p>Appellants\' final challenge is to the constitutionality of Chapter 96, which provides funding of primary campaigns.  They contend that these provisions are constitutionally invalid (1) because they do not provide funds for candidates not running in party primaries [<a href="#F142" name="T142">Footnote 142</a>] and (2) because the eligibility formula actually increases the influence of money on the electoral process.  In not providing assistance to candidates who do not enter party primaries, Congress has merely chosen to limit at this time the reach of the reforms encompassed in Chapter 96.  This Congress could do without constituting the reforms a constitutionally invidious discrimination.  The governing principle was stated in <em>Katzenbach v. Morgan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/641/case.html">384 U. S. 641</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/641/case.html#657">384 U.

S. 106</a></p><p> The choice to limit matching funds to candidates running in primaries may reflect that concern about large private contributions to candidates centered on primary races and that there is no historical evidence of similar abuses involving contributions to candidates who engage in petition drives to qualify for state ballots.  Moreover, assistance to candidates and nonmajor parties forced to resort to petition drives to gain ballot access implicates the policies against fostering frivolous candidacies, creating a system of splintered parties, and encouraging unrestrained factionalism."</p>\n<p>The eligibility requirements in Chapter 96 are surely not an unreasonable way to measure popular support for a candidate, accomplishing the objective of limiting subsidization to those candidates with a substantial chance of being nominated.  Counting only the first $250 of each contribution for eligibility purposes requires candidates to solicit smaller contributions from numerous people.  Requiring the money to come from citizens of a minimum number of States eliminates candidates whose appeal is limited geographically; a President is elected not by popular vote, but by winning the popular vote in enough States to have a majority in the Electoral College.

The thrust of the legislation is to reduce financial barriers [<a href="#F145" name="T145">Footnote 145</a>] and to enhance the importance of smaller contributions. [<a href="#F146" name="T146">Footnote 146</a>]  Some candidates undoubtedly could raise large sums of money, and thus have little need for public funds, but candidates with lesser fundraising capabilities will gain substantial benefits from matching funds.  In addition, one eligibility requirement for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 424 U. S. 108</a></p><p> matching funds is acceptance of an expenditure ceiling, and candidates with little fundraising ability will be able to increase their spending relative to candidates capable of raising large amounts in private funds.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, we reject appellants\' claims that Subtitle H is facially unconstitutional. [<a href="#F147" name="T147">Footnote 147</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C. Severability\n</em></p>\n<p>The only remaining issue is whether our holdings invalidating 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(a), (c), and ()(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) require the conclusion that Subtitle H is unconstitutional.  There is, of course, a relationship between the spending limits in \xc2\xa7 608(c) and the public financing provisions; the expenditure limits accepted by a candidate to be eligible for public funding are identical to the limits in \xc2\xa7 608(c).  But we have no difficulty in concluding that Subtitle H is severable.</p>\n<p>"Unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/case.html">Champlin</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 424 U.

Our discussion of "what is left" leaves no doubt that the value of public financing is not dependent on the existence of a generally applicable expenditure limit.  We therefore hold Subtitle H severable from those portions of the legislation today held constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3>. THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION<p></p>\n<p>The 1974 amendments to the Act create an eight-member Federal Election Commission (Commission) and vest in it primary and substantial responsibility for administering and enforcing the Act.  The question that we address in this portion of the opinion is whether, in view of the manner in which a majority of its members are appointed, the Commission may, under the Constitution, exercise the powers conferred upon it.  We find it unnecessary to parse the complex statutory provisions in order to sketch the full sweep of the Commission\'s authority.  It will suffice for present purposes to describe what appear to be representative examples of its various powers.</p>\n<p>Chapter 14 of Title 2. [<a href="#F148" name="T148">Footnote 148</a>] makes the Commission the principal repository of the numerous reports and statements which are required by that chapter to be filed by those engaging in the regulated political activities.  Its duties under \xc2\xa7 438(a) with respect to these reports and statements include filing and indexing, making them available for public inspection, preservation, and auditing and field investigations.

Its duty under \xc2\xa7 438(a)(10) is "to prescribe suitable rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of . . . chapter [14]."  Under \xc2\xa7 437d(a)(8), the Commission is empowered to make such rules "as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act." [<a href="#F149" name="T149">Footnote 149</a>]  Section 437d(a)(9) authorizes it to "formulate general policy with respect to the administration of this Act" and enumerated sections of Title 18\'s Criminal Code, [<a href="#F150" name="T150">Footnote 150</a>] as to all of which provisions the Commission "has primary jurisdiction with respect to [their] civil enforcement."  \xc2\xa7 437c(b). [<a href="#F151" name="T151">Footnote 151</a>]  The Commission is authorized under \xc2\xa7 437f(a) to render advisory opinions with respect to activities possibly violating the Act, the Title 18 sections, or the campaign funding provisions of Title 26, [<a href="#F152" name="T152">Footnote 152</a>] the effect of which is that,</p>\n<p>"[n]otwithstanding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 424 U.

If, after the Commission\'s post-disbursement audit of candidates receiving payments under Chapter 95 or 96, it finds an overpayment, it is empowered to seek repayment of all funds due the Secretary of the Treasury.  26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9010(b), 9040(b) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  In no respect do the foregoing civil actions require the concurrence of or participation by the Attorney General; conversely, the decision not to seek judicial relief in the above respects would appear to rest solely with the Commission.

Finally, as "[a]dditional enforcement authority," \xc2\xa7 456(a) authorizes the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to make "a finding that a person . . . while a candidate for Federal office, failed to file" a required report of contributions or expenditures.

Before embarking on this or any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 424 U. S. 114</a></p><p> related inquiry, however, we must decide whether these issues are properly before us.  Because of the Court of Appeals\' emphasis on lack of "ripeness" of the issue relating to the method of appointment of the members of the Commission, we find it necessary to focus particularly on that consideration in this section of our opinion.</p>\n<p>We have recently recognized the distinction between jurisdictional limitations imposed by Art. III and "[p]roblems of prematurity and abstractness" that may prevent adjudication in all but the exceptional case.  <em>Socialist Labor Party v.

We likewise observed in the <em>Reorganization Act Cases:</em></p>\n<p>"Thus, occurrence of the conveyance allegedly violative of Fifth Amendment rights is in no way hypothetical or speculative.

The court held that the remaining aspects of the Commission\'s authority could not be adjudicated, because, "[in] its present stance, this litigation does not present the court with the concrete facts that are necessary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 424 U.

Thus, in order to decide the basic question whether the Act\'s provision for appointment of the members of the Commission violates the Constitution, we believe we are warranted in considering all of those aspects of the Commission\'s authority which have been presented by the certified questions. [<a href="#F158" name="T158">Footnote 158</a>]</p>\n<p>Party litigants with sufficient concrete interests at stake may have standing to raise constitutional questions of separation of powers with respect to an agency designated to adjudicate their rights.  <em>Palmore v.

In <em>Glidden,</em> of course, the challenged adjudication had already taken place, whereas in this case appellants\' claim is of impending future rulings and determinations by the Commission.  But this is a question of ripeness, rather than lack of case or controversy under Art. III, and, for the reasons to which we have previously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 424 U. S. 118</a></p><p> adverted we hold that appellants\' claims as they bear upon the method of appointment of the Commission\'s members may be presently adjudicated.</p>\n<p><em>B. The Merits\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants urge that, since Congress has given the Commission wide-ranging rulemaking and enforcement powers with respect to the substantive provisions of the Act, Congress is precluded under the principle of separation of powers from vesting in itself the authority to appoint those who will exercise such authority.  Their argument is based on the language of Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p>"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:  but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."</p>\n<p>Appellants\' argument is that this provision is the exclusive method by which those charged with executing the laws of the United States may be chosen.  Congress, they assert, cannot have it both ways.  If the Legislature wishes the Commission to exercise all of the conferred powers, then its members are, in fact, "Officers of the United States," and must be appointed under the Appointments Clause.  But if Congress insists upon retaining the power to appoint, then the members of the Commission may not discharge those many functions of the Commission which can be performed only by "Officers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 424 U. S. 119</a></p><p> the United States," as that term must be construed within the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p>Appellee Commission and <em>amici</em> in support of the Commission urge that the Framers of the Constitution, while mindful of the need for checks and balances among the three branches of the National Government, had no intention of denying to the Legislative Branch authority to appoint its own officers.  Congress, either under the Appointments Clause or under its grants of substantive legislative authority and the Necessary and Proper Clause in Art. I, is, in their view, empowered to provide for the appointment to the Commission in the manner which it did because the Commission is performing "appropriate legislative functions."</p>\n<p>The majority of the Court of Appeals recognized the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers which is at the heart of our Constitution, and also recognized the principle enunciated in <em>Springer v. Philippine Islands,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html">277 U. S. 189</a></span> (1928), that the Legislative Branch may not exercise executive authority by retaining the power to appoint those who will execute its laws.  But it described appellants\' argument based upon Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2 as "strikingly syllogistic," and concluded that Congress had sufficient authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I of the Constitution not only to establish the Commission but to appoint the Commission\'s members.  As we have earlier noted, it upheld the constitutional validity of congressional vesting of certain authority in the Commission, and concluded that the question of the constitutional validity of the vesting of its remaining functions was not yet ripe for review.  The three dissenting judges in the Court of Appeals concluded that the method of appointment for the Commission did violate the doctrine of separation of powers. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 424 U. S. 120</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We do not think appellants\' arguments based upon Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution may be so easily dismissed as did the majority of the Court of Appeals.  Our inquiry, of necessity, touches upon the fundamental principles of the Government established by the Framers of the Constitution, and all litigants and all of the courts which have addressed themselves to the matter start on common ground in the recognition of the intent of the Framers that the powers of the three great branches of the National Government be largely separate from one another.</p>\n<p>James Madison, writing in the Federalist No. 47, [<a href="#F159" name="T159">Footnote 159</a>] defended the work of the Framers against the charge that these three governmental powers were not entirely separate from one another in the proposed Constitution.  He asserted that, while there was some admixture, the Constitution was nonetheless true to Montesquieu\'s well known maxim that the legislative, executive, and judicial departments ought to be separate and distinct:</p>\n<p>"The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning.  \'When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body,\' says he,"</p>\n<p>"there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest <em>the same</em> monarch or senate should <em>enact</em> tyrannical laws to <em>execute</em> them in a tyrannical manner."</p>\n<p>"Again:"</p>\n<p>"Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for <em>the judge</em> would then be <em>the legislator.</em>  Were it joined to the executive power, <em>the judge</em> might behave with all the violence of <em>an oppressor.</em>"</p>\n<p>"Some of these reasons </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 424 U. S. 121</a></p><p> are more fully explained in other passages; but, briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author. [<a href="#F160" name="T160">Footnote 160</a>]"</p>\n<p>Yet it is also clear from the provisions of the Constitution itself, and from the Federalist Papers, that the Constitution by no means contemplates total separation of each of these three essential branches of Government.  The President is a participant in the lawmaking process by virtue of his authority to veto bills enacted by Congress.  The Senate is a participant in the appointive process by virtue of its authority to refuse to confirm persons nominated to office by the President.  The men who met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 were practical statesmen, experienced in politics, who viewed the principle of separation of powers as a vital check against tyranny.  But they likewise saw that a hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government from one another would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of governing itself effectively.</p>\n<p>Mr. Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court in <em>Hampton &amp; Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/394/case.html">276 U. S. 394</a></span> (1928), after stating the general principle of separation of powers found in the United States Constitution, went on to observe:</p>\n<p>"[T]he rule is that, in the actual administration of the government, Congress or the Legislature should exercise the legislative power, the President or the State executive, the Governor, the executive power, and the Courts or the judiciary the judicial power, and in carrying out that constitutional division into three branches, it is a breach of the National fundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 424 U. S. 122</a></p><p> and transfers it to the President, or to the Judicial branch, or if, by law, it attempts to invest itself or its members with either executive power or judicial power.  This is not to say that the three branches are not coordinate parts of one government, and that each, in the field of its duties, may not invoke the action of the two other branches insofar as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch.  In determining what it may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental coordination."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/394/case.html#406">276 U. S. 406</a></span>.</p>\n<p>More recently, Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in the opinion and the judgment of the Court in <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/case.html">343 U.

S. 635</a></span> (1952), succinctly characterized this understanding:</p>\n<p>"While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government.  It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity."</p>\n<p>The Framers regarded the checks and balances that they had built into the tripartite Federal Government as a self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.  As Madison put it in Federalist No. 51:</p>\n<p>"This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public.  We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 424 U. S. 123</a></p><p> several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other -- that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State. [<a href="#F161" name="T161">Footnote 161</a>]"</p>\n<p>This Court has not hesitated to enforce the principle of separation of powers embodied in the Constitution when its application has proved necessary for the decisions of cases or controversies properly before it.  The Court has held that executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature may not be imposed on judges holding office under Art. III of the Constitution.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/54/40/case.html">United States v.

The Court has held that the President may not execute and exercise legislative authority belonging only to Congress.  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.  And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute.

Philippine Islands,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html">277 U. S. 189</a></span> (1928), where the Court held that the legislature of the Philippine Islands could not provide for legislative appointment to executive agencies.</p>\n<p>2. The Appointments Clause</p>\n<p>The principle of separation of powers was not simply an abstract generalization in the minds of the Framers:  it was woven into the document that they drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.  Article I, \xc2\xa7 1, declares:  "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States."  Article II, \xc2\xa7 1, vests the executive power "in a President of the United States of America," and Art. III, \xc2\xa7 1, declares that</p>\n<p>"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."</p>\n<p>The further concern of the Framers of the Constitution with maintenance of the separation of powers is found in the so-called "Ineligibility" and "Incompatibility" Clauses contained in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6:</p>\n<p>"No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."</p>\n<p>It is in the context of these cognate provisions of the document that we must examine the language of Art. II. \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, which appellants contend provides the only authorization for appointment of those to whom substantial executive or administrative authority is given </p><p><a class="page-number" name="125">Page 424 U. S. 125</a></p><p> by statute.  Because of the importance of its language, we again set out the provision:</p>\n<p>"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:  but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers as they think proper in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."</p>\n<p>The Appointments Clause could, of course, be read as merely dealing with etiquette or protocol in describing "Officers of the United States," but the drafters had a less frivolous purpose in mind.  This conclusion is supported by language from <em>United States v. Germaine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/508/case.html">99 U. S. 508</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/508/case.html#509">99 U. S. 509</a></span>-510 (1879):</p>\n<p>"The Constitution, for purposes of appointment, very clearly divides all its officers into two classes.  The primary class requires a nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate.  But foreseeing that, when offices became numerous, and sudden removals necessary, this mode might be inconvenient, it was provided that, in regard to officers inferior to those specially mentioned, Congress might, by law, vest their appointment in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.  <em>That all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government about to be established under the Constitution were intended to be included within one or the other of these modes of appointment there can be but little doubt.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)  We think that the term "Officers of the United States," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 424 U. S. 126</a></p><p> as used in Art. II, defined to include "all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government" in <em>United States v. Germaine, supra,</em> is a term intended to have substantive meaning.  We think its fair import is that any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States is an "Officer of the United States," and must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.</p>\n<p>If "all persons who can be said to hold an office under the government about to be established under the Constitution were intended to be included within one or the other of these modes of appointment," <em>United States v. Germaine, supra,</em> it is difficult to see how the members of the Commission may escape inclusion.  If a postmaster first class, <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span> (1926), and the clerk of a district court, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/230/case.html">Ex parte Hennen,</a></span></em> 13 Pet. 230 (1839), are inferior officers of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, as they are, surely the Commissioners before us are, at the very least, such "inferior Officers" within the meaning of that Clause. [<a href="#F162" name="T162">Footnote 162</a>]</p>\n<p>Although two members of the Commission are initially selected by the President, his nominations are subject to confirmation not merely by the Senate, but by the House of Representatives as well.  The remaining four voting members of the Commission are appointed by the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate and by the Speaker of the House.  While the second part of the Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 424 U. S. 127</a></p><p> authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of the officers described in that part in "the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments," neither the Speaker of the House nor the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate comes within this language.</p>\n<p>The phrase "Heads of Departments," used as it is in conjunction with the phrase "Courts of Law," suggests that the Departments referred to are themselves in the Executive Branch or at least have some connection with that branch.  While the Clause expressly authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of certain officers in the "Courts of Law," the absence of similar language to include Congress must mean that neither Congress nor its officers were included within the language "Heads of Departments" in this part of cl. 2.</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to four of the six voting members of the Commission, neither the President, the head of any department, nor the Judiciary has any voice in their selection.</p>\n<p>The Appointments Clause specifies the method of appointment only for "Officers of the United States" whose appointment is not "otherwise provided for" in the Constitution.  But there is no provision of the Constitution remotely providing any alternative means for the selection of the members of the Commission or for anybody like them.  Appellee Commission has argued, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the Appointments Clause of Art. II should not be read to exclude the "inherent power of Congress" to appoint its own officers to perform functions necessary to that body as an institution.  But there is no need to read the Appointments Clause contrary to its plain language in order to reach the result sought by the Court of Appeals.  Article I, \xc2\xa7 3, cl. 5, expressly authorizes the selection of the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate, and \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 5, of that Article provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 424 U. S. 128</a></p><p> for the selection of the Speaker of the House. Ranking nonmembers, such as the Clerk of the House of Representatives, are elected under the internal rules of each House, [<a href="#F163" name="T163">Footnote 163</a>] and are designated by statute as "officers of the Congress." [<a href="#F164" name="T164">Footnote 164</a>]  There is no occasion for us to decide whether any of these member officers are "Officers of the United States" whose "appointment" is otherwise provided for within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, since, even if they were such officers, their appointees would not be.  Contrary to the fears expressed by the majority of the Court of Appeals, nothing in our holding with respect to Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, will deny to Congress "all power to appoint its own inferior officers to carry out appropriate legislative functions." [<a href="#F165" name="T165">Footnote 165</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellee Commission and <em>amici</em> contend somewhat obliquely that, because the Framers had no intention of relegating Congress to a position below that of the coequal Judicial and Executive Branches of the National Government, the Appointments Clause must somehow be read to include Congress or its officers as among those </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 424 U. S. 129</a></p><p> in whom the appointment power may be vested.  But the debates of the Constitutional Convention, and the Federalist Papers, are replete with expressions of fear that the Legislative Branch of the National Government will aggrandize itself at the expense of the other two branches. [<a href="#F166" name="T166">Footnote 166</a>]  The debates during the Convention, and the evolution of the draft version of the Constitution, seem to us to lend considerable support to our reading of the language of the Appointments Clause itself.</p>\n<p>An interim version of the draft Constitution had vested in the Senate the authority to appoint Ambassadors, public Ministers, and Judges of the Supreme Court, and the language of Art. II as finally adopted is a distinct change in this regard.  We believe that it was a deliberate change made by the Framers with the intent to deny Congress any authority itself to appoint those who were "Officers of the United States."  The debates on the floor of the Convention reflect at least in part the way the change came about.</p>\n<p>On Monday, August 6, 1787, the Committee on Detail to which had been referred the entire draft of the Constitution reported its draft to the Convention, including the following two articles that bear on the question before us: [<a href="#F167" name="T167">Footnote 167</a>]</p>\n<p>"Article IX, \xc2\xa7 1:  \'The Senate of the United States shall have power . . . to appoint Ambassadors, and Judges of the Supreme Court.\'"</p>\n<p>"Article X, \xc2\xa7 2:  \'[The President] shall commission all </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 424 U. S. 130</a></p><p> the officers of the United States, and shall appoint officers in all cases not otherwise provided for by this Constitution.\'"</p>\n<p>It will be seen from a comparison of these two articles that the appointment of Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court was confided to the Senate, and that the authority to <em>appoint</em> -- not merely nominate, but to actually appoint -- all other officers was reposed in the President.</p>\n<p>During a discussion of a provision in the same draft from the Committee on Detail which provided that the "Treasurer" of the United States should be chosen by both Houses of Congress, Mr Read moved to strike out that clause, "leaving the appointment of the Treasurer <em>as of other officers</em> to the Executive." [<a href="#F168" name="T168">Footnote 168</a>]  Opposition to Read\'s motion was based not on objection to the principle of executive appointment, but on the particular nature of the office of the "Treasurer." [<a href="#F169" name="T169">Footnote 169</a>]</p>\n<p>On Thursday, August 23, the Convention voted to insert after the word "Ambassadors" in the text of draft Art. IX the words "and other public Ministers."  Immediately afterwards, the section as amended was referred to the "Committee of Five." [<a href="#F170" name="T170">Footnote 170</a>]  The following day, the Convention took up Art. X.  Roger Sherman objected to the draft language of \xc2\xa7 2 because it conferred too much power on the President, and proposed to insert after the words "not otherwise provided for by this Constitution" the words "or by law."  This motion was defeated by a vote of nine States to one. [<a href="#F171" name="T171">Footnote 171</a>]  On September </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 424 U. S. 131</a></p><p> 3, the Convention debated the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses which now appear in Art. I, and made the Ineligibility Clause somewhat less stringent. [<a href="#F172" name="T172">Footnote 172</a>]</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on Friday, August 31, a motion had been carried without opposition to refer such parts of the Constitution as had been postponed or not acted upon to a Committee of Eleven.  Such reference carried with it both Arts. IX and X.  The following week, the Committee of Eleven made its report to the Convention, in which the present language of Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, dealing with the authority of the President to nominate is found, virtually word for word, as \xc2\xa7 4 of Art. X. [<a href="#F173" name="T173">Footnote 173</a>]  The same Committee also reported a revised article concerning the Legislative Branch to the Convention.  The changes are obvious.  In the final version, the Senate is shorn of its power to appoint Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court.  The President is given not the power to appoint public officers of the United States, but only the right to nominate them, and a provision is inserted by virtue of which Congress may require Senate confirmation of his nominees.</p>\n<p>It would seem a fair surmise that a compromise had been made.  But no change was made in the concept of the term "Officers of the United States," which, since it had first appeared in Art. X, had been taken by all concerned to embrace all appointed officials exercising responsibility under the public laws of the Nation.</p>\n<p>Appellee Commission and <em>amici</em> urge that, because of what they conceive to be the extraordinary authority reposed in Congress to regulate elections, this case stands on a different footing than if Congress had exercised its legislative authority in another field.  There is, of course, no doubt that Congress has express authority to regulate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 424 U. S. 132</a></p><p> congressional elections, by virtue of the power conferred in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 4. [<a href="#F174" name="T174">Footnote 174</a>]  This Court has also held that it has very broad authority to prevent corruption in national Presidential elections.  <em>Burroughs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html">290 U. S. 534</a></span> (1934).  But Congress has plenary authority in all areas in which it has substantive legislative jurisdiction, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">M\'Culloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), so long as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction.  We see no reason to believe that the authority of Congress over federal election practices is of such a wholly different nature from the other grants of authority to Congress that it may be employed in such a manner as to offend well established constitutional restrictions stemming from the separation of powers.</p>\n<p>The position that, because Congress has been given explicit and plenary authority to regulate a field of activity, it must therefore have the power to appoint those who are to administer the regulatory statute is both novel and contrary to the language of the Appointments Clause.  Unless their selection is elsewhere provided for, all officers of the United States are to be appointed in accordance with the Clause.  Principal officers are selected by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Inferior officers Congress may allow to be appointed by the President alone, by the heads of departments, or by the Judiciary.  No class or type of officer is excluded because of its special functions.  The President appoints judicial, as well as executive, officers.  Neither has it been disputed -- and apparently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 424 U. S. 133</a></p><p> it is not now disputed -- that the Clause controls the appointment of the members of a typical administrative agency even though its functions, as this Court recognized in <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#624">295 U. S. 624</a></span> (1935), may be "predominantly <em>quasi</em>-judicial and <em>quasi</em>-legislative," rather than executive.  The Court in that case carefully emphasized that, although the members of such agencies were to be independent of the Executive in their day-to-day operations, the Executive was not excluded from selecting them.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#625">295 U. S. 625</a></span>-626.</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that the legislative authority conferred upon the Congress in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 4, to regulate "the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives" is augmented by the provision in \xc2\xa7 5 that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members."  Section 5 confers, however, not a general legislative power upon the Congress, but rather a power "judicial in character" upon each House of the Congress.  <em>Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/279/597/case.html">279 U. S. 597</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/279/597/case.html#613">279 U. S. 613</a></span> (1929).  The power of each House to judge whether one claiming election as Senator or Representative has met the requisite qualifications, <em>Powell v. McCormack,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/486/case.html">395 U. S. 486</a></span> (1969), cannot reasonably be translated into a power granted to the Congress itself to impose substantive qualifications on the right to so hold such office.  Whatever power Congress may have to legislate, such qualifications must derive from \xc2\xa7 4, rather than \xc2\xa7 5, of Art. I.</p>\n<p>Appellees also rely on the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution insofar as the authority of the Commission to regulate practices in connection with the Presidential election is concerned.  This Amendment provides that certificates of the votes of the electors be "sealed [and] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 424 U. S. 134</a></p><p> directed to the President of the Senate," and that the "President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted."  The method by which Congress resolved the celebrated disputed Hayes-Tilden election of 1876, reflected in 19 Stat. 227, supports the conclusion that Congress viewed this Amendment as conferring upon its two Houses the same sort of power "judicial in character," <em>Barr v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/279/597/case.html#613">279 U. S. 613</a></span>, as was conferred upon each House by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 5, with respect to elections of its own members.</p>\n<p>We are also told by appellees and <em>amici</em> that Congress had good reason for not vesting in a Commission composed wholly of Presidential appointees the authority to administer the Act, since the administration of the Act would undoubtedly have a bearing on any incumbent President\'s campaign for reelection.  While one cannot dispute the basis for this sentiment as a practical matter, it would seem that those who sought to challenge incumbent Congressmen might have equally good reason to fear a Commission which was unduly responsive to members of Congress whom they were seeking to unseat.  But such fears, however rational, do not, by themselves, warrant a distortion of the Framers\' work.</p>\n<p>Appellee Commission and <em>amici</em> finally contend, and the majority of the Court of Appeals agreed with them, that, whatever shortcomings the provisions for the appointment of members of the Commission might have under Art. II, Congress had ample authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I to effectuate this result.  We do not agree.  The proper inquiry when considering the Necessary and Proper Clause is not the authority of Congress to create an office or a commission, which is broad indeed, but rather its authority to provide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 424 U. S. 135</a></p><p> that its own officers may make appointments to such office or commission.</p>\n<p>So framed, the claim that Congress may provide for this manner of appointment under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art. I stands on no better footing than the claim that it may provide for such manner of appointment because of its substantive authority to regulate federal elections.  Congress could not, merely because it concluded that such a measure was "necessary and proper" to the discharge of its substantive legislative authority, pass a bill of attainder or <em>ex post facto</em> law contrary to the prohibitions contained in \xc2\xa7 9 of Art. I.  No more may it vest in itself, or in its officers, the authority to appoint officers of the United States when the Appointments Clause, by clear implication, prohibits it from doing so.</p>\n<p>The trilogy of cases from this Court dealing with the constitutional authority of Congress to circumscribe the President\'s power to <em>remove</em> officers of the United States is entirely consistent with this conclusion.  In <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span> (1926), the Court held that Congress could not, by statute, divest the President of the power to remove an officer in the Executive Branch whom he was initially authorized to appoint.  In explaining its reasoning in that case, the Court said:</p>\n<p>"The vesting of the executive power in the President was essentially a grant of the power to execute the laws.  But the President, alone and unaided, could not execute the laws.  He must execute them by the assistance of subordinates. . . .  As he is charged specifically to take care that they be faithfully executed, the reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that, as part of his executive power, he should select those who were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 424 U. S. 136</a></p><p> to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Our conclusion on the merits, sustained by the arguments before stated, is that Article II grants to the President the executive power of the Government, <em>i.e.,</em> the general administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers -- a conclusion confirmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#117">272 U.

S. 163</a></span>-164.</p>\n<p>In the later case of <em>Humphrey\'s Executor,</em> where it was held that Congress could circumscribe the President\'s power to remove members of independent regulatory agencies, the Court was careful to note that it was dealing with an agency intended to be independent of executive authority "<em>except in its selection.</em>"  295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#625">295 U.

S. 349</a></span> (1958), which applied the holding in <em>Humphrey\'s Executor</em> to a member of the War Claims Commission, did not question in any respect that members of independent agencies are not independent of the Executive with respect to their appointments.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Mr. Justice Sutherland, the author of the Court\'s opinion in <em>Humphrey\'s Executor,</em> likewise wrote the opinion for the Court in <em>Springer v. Philippine Islands,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html">277 U.

The Commission\'s Powers</p>\n<p>Thus, on the assumption that all of the powers granted in the statute may be exercised by an agency whose members <em>have been</em> appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause, [<a href="#F175" name="T175">Footnote 175</a>] the ultimate question is which, if any, of those powers may be exercised by the present voting Commissioners, none of whom was appointed as provided by that Clause.  Our previous description of the statutory provisions, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">424 U. S. 109</span>-113, disclosed that the Commission\'s powers fall generally into three categories:  functions relating to the flow of necessary information -- receipt, dissemination, and investigation; functions with respect to the Commission\'s task of fleshing out the statute -- rulemaking and advisory opinions; and functions necessary to ensure compliance with the statute and rules -- informal procedures, administrative determinations and hearings, and civil suits.</p>\n<p>Insofar as the powers confided in the Commission are essentially of an investigative and informative nature, falling in the same general category as those powers which Congress might delegate to one of its own committees, there can be no question that the Commission as presently constituted may exercise them.  <em>Kilbourn v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/168/case.html">103 U. S. 168</a></span> (1881); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/135/case.html">McGrain v. Daugherty,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 424 U.

United States Servicemen\'s Fund,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/491/case.html">421 U. S. 491</a></span> (1975).  As this Court stated in <em>McGrain, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/135/case.html#175">273 U. S. 175</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information -- which not infrequently is true -- recourse must be had to others who do possess it.  Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed.  All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted.  In that period, the power of inquiry -- with enforcing process -- was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate -- indeed, was treated as inhering in it."</p>\n<p>But when we go beyond this type of authority to the more substantial powers exercised by the Commission, we reach a different result.  The Commission\'s enforcement power, exemplified by its discretionary power to seek judicial relief, is authority that cannot possibly be regarded as merely in aid of the legislative function of Congress.  A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach of the law, and it is to the President, and not to the Congress, that the Constitution entrusts the responsibility to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  Art. II, \xc2\xa7 3</p>\n<p>Congress may undoubtedly under the Necessary and Proper Clause create "offices" in the generic sense and provide such method of appointment to those "offices" as it chooses.  But Congress\' power under that Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 424 U. S. 139</a></p><p> is inevitably bounded by the express language of Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, and, unless the method it provides comports with the latter, the holders of those offices will not be "Officers of the United States."  They may, therefore, properly perform duties only in aid of those functions that Congress may carry out by itself, or in an area sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of the public law as to permit their being performed by persons not "Officers of the United States."</p>\n<p>This Court observed more than a century ago with respect to litigation conducted in the courts of the United States:</p>\n<p>"Whether tested, therefore, by the requirements of the Judiciary Act, or by the usage of the government, or by the decisions of this court, it is clear that all such suits, so far as the interests of the United States are concerned, are subject to the direction, and within the control of, the Attorney General."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/454/case.html">Confiscation Cases,</a></span></em> 7 Wall. 454,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/454/case.html#458">74 U.

Philippine Islands,</em> 277 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/189/case.html#202">277 U. S. 202</a></span>, saying:</p>\n<p>"Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement.  The latter are executive functions.  It is unnecessary to enlarge further upon the general subject, since it has so recently received the full consideration of this Court.  <em>Myers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/272/52/case.html">272 U. S. 52</a></span>."</p>\n<p>"Not having the power of appointment unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the legislature cannot engraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection, though the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 424 U. S. 140</a></p><p> case might be different if the additional duties were devolved upon an appointee of the executive."</p>\n<p>We hold that these provisions of the Act, vesting in the Commission primary responsibility for conducting civil litigation in the courts of the United States for vindicating public rights, violate Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Such functions may be discharged only by persons who are "Officers of the United States" within the language of that section.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the Act are brought within the Commission\'s broad administrative powers:  rulemaking, advisory opinions, and determinations of eligibility for funds and even for federal elective office itself.  These functions, exercised free from day-to-day supervision of either Congress [<a href="#F176" name="T176">Footnote 176</a>] or the Executive Branch, are more legislative and judicial in nature than are the Commission\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 424 U. S. 141</a></p><p> enforcement powers, and are of kinds usually performed by independent regulatory agencies or by some department in the Executive Branch under the direction of an Act of Congress.  Congress viewed these broad powers as essential to effective and impartial administration of the entire substantive framework of the Act.  Yet each of these functions also represents the performance of a significant governmental duty exercised pursuant to a public law.  While the President may not insist that such functions be delegated to an appointee of his removable at will, <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935), none of them operates merely in aid of congressional authority to legislate or is sufficiently removed from the administration and enforcement of public law to allow it to be performed by the present Commission.  These administrative functions may therefore be exercised only by persons who are "Officers of the United States." [<a href="#F177" name="T177">Footnote 177</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 424 U. S. 142</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is also our view that the Commission\'s inability to exercise certain powers because of the method by which its members have been selected should not affect the validity of the Commission\'s administrative actions and determinations to this date, including its administration of those provisions, upheld today, authorizing the public financing of federal elections.  The past acts of the Commission are therefore accorded <em>de facto</em> validity, just as we have recognized should be the case with respect to legislative acts performed by legislators held to have been elected in accordance with an unconstitutional apportionment plan.  <em>Connor v.

We conclude, however, that the limitations on campaign expenditures, on independent expenditures by individuals and groups, and on expenditures by a candidate from his personal funds are constitutionally infirm.  Finally, we hold that most of the powers conferred by the Act upon the Federal Election Commission can be exercised only by "Officers of the United States," appointed in conformity with Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, and therefore cannot be exercised by the Commission as presently constituted.</p>\n<p>In No. 75-436, the judgment of the Court of Appeals </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 424 U. S. 144</a></p><p> is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The judgment of the District Court in No. 75-437 is affirmed.  The mandate shall issue forthwith, except that our judgment is stayed, for a period not to exceed 30 days, insofar as it affects the authority of the Commission to exercise the duties and powers granted it under the Act.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

The court suggested that a three-judge District Court should consider the constitutionality of these provisions in order to protect against the contingency that this Court might eventually hold these issues to be subject to determination by a three-judge court, either under \xc2\xa7 9011(b), or 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2282, 2284.  171 U.S.App.D.C. 168, 170, 519 F.2d 817, 819 (1975).

Thus, two judgments are before us -- one from each court -- upholding the constitutionality of Subtitle H, though the two cases before the Court will generally be referred to hereinafter in the singular.

By contrast, the Act\'s dollar ceilings restrict the extent of the reasonable use of virtually every means of communicating information.

The 1972 senatorial figures showed that 18 of 66 major party candidates exceeded the Act\'s limitations.

Other courts have given that phrase a narrow meaning to alleviate various problems in other contexts.  <em>See United States v. National Comm. for Impeachment,</em> 469 F.2d 1135, 1139-1142 (CA2 1972); <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings,</em> 366 F.Supp. 1041, 1055-1057 (DC 1973) (three-judge court), <em>vacated as moot sub nom. Staats v. American Civil Liberties Union,</em> 422 U.S. 1030 (1975).  The use of the phrase presents fewer problems in connection with the definition of a contribution because of the limiting connotation created by the general understanding of what constitutes a political contribution.  Funds provided to a candidate or political party or campaign committee either directly or indirectly through an intermediary constitute a contribution.  In addition, dollars given to another person or organization that are earmarked for political purposes are contributions under the Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Expenditures by persons and associations that are "authorized or requested" by the candidate or his agents are treated as contributions under the Act.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F53" name="T53">n</a> 53, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>Contribution limitations alone would not reduce the greater potential voice of affluent persons and well financed groups, who would remain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote candidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade voters.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>Yet, a ceiling on the size of contributions would affect only indirectly the costs of political campaigns by making it relatively more difficult for candidates to raise large amounts of money.  In 1974, for example, 94.9% of the funds raised by candidates for Congress came from contributions of $1,000 or less, <em>see</em> <a href="#F23" name="T23">n</a> 23, <em>supra.</em>  Presumably, some or all of the contributions in excess of $1,000 could have been replaced through efforts to raise additional contributions from persons giving less than $1,000.  It is the Act\'s campaign expenditure limitations, \xc2\xa7 608(c), not the contribution limits, that directly address the over-all scope of federal election spending.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' opinion in this case discussed a number of the abuses uncovered after the 1972 elections.  <em>See</em> 171 U.S.App.D.C. at 190-191, and nn. 36-38, 519 F.2d at 839-840, and nn. 36-38.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Court in <em>Letter Carriers</em> found that this interest was constitutionally sufficient to justify legislation prohibiting federal employees from engaging in certain partisan political activities, it was careful to emphasize that the limitations did not restrict an employee\'s right to express his views on political issues and candidates.  413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html#561">413 U.

As a prime example, \xc2\xa7 610 permits corporations and labor unions to establish segregated funds to solicit voluntary contributions to be utilized for political purposes.  Corporate and union resources without limitation may be employed to administer these funds and to solicit contributions from employees, stockholders, and union members.  Each separate fund may contribute up to $5,000 per candidate per election so long as the fund qualifies as a political committee under \xc2\xa7 608(b)(2).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 93-1237, pp. 50-52 (1974); Federal Election Commission, Advisory Opinion 1975-23, 40 Fed.Reg. 56584 (1975).</p>\n<p>The Act places no limit on the number of funds that may be formed through the use of subsidiaries or divisions of corporations, or of local and regional units of a national labor union.  The potential for proliferation of these sources of contributions is not insignificant.  In 1972, approximately 1,824,000 active corporations filed federal income tax returns.  Internal Revenue Service, Preliminary Statistics of Income 1972, Corporation Income Tax Returns, p. 1 (Pub. 159 (11-74)).  (It is not clear whether this total includes subsidiary corporations where the parent filed a consolidated return.)  In the same year, 71,409 local unions were chartered by national unions.  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations 1973, p. 87 (1974).</p>\n<p>The Act allows the maximum contribution to be made by each unit\'s fund provided the decision or judgment to contribute to particular candidates is made by the fund independently of control or direction by the parent corporation or the national or regional union.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

We do not address the more serious argument that these limitations, in combination with the limitation on expenditures by individuals and groups, the limitation on a candidate\'s use of his own personal and family resources, and the over-all ceiling on campaign expenditures invidiously discriminate against major party challengers and minor party candidates.</p>\n<p>Since an incumbent is subject to these limitations to the same degree as his opponent, the Act, on its face, appears to be evenhanded.  The appearance of fairness, however, may not reflect political reality.  Although some incumbents are defeated in every congressional election, it is axiomatic that an incumbent usually begins the race with significant advantages.  In addition to the factors of voter recognition and the status accruing to holding federal office, the incumbent has access to substantial resources provided by the Government.  These include local and Washington offices, staff support, and the franking privilege.  Where the incumbent has the support of major special interest groups which have the flexibility described in  <a href="#F31" name="T31">n</a> 31, <em>supra,</em> and is further supported by the media, the over-all effect of the contribution and expenditure limitations enacted by Congress could foreclose any fair opportunity of a successful challenge.</p>\n<p>However, since we decide in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#39">424 U. S. </a></span> <em>infra</em> that the ceilings on independent expenditures, on the candidate\'s expenditures from his personal funds, and on over-all campaign expenditures are unconstitutional under the First Amendment, we need not express any opinion with regard to the alleged invidious discrimination resulting from the full sweep of the legislation as enacted.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T34" name="F34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1974, for example, 40 major party challengers defeated incumbent members of the House of Representatives in the general election.  Four incumbent Senators were defeated by major party challengers in the 1974 primary and general election campaigns.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>In the 1974 races for the House of Representatives, three of the 22 major party candidates exceeding the combined expenditure limits contained in the Act were challengers to incumbents and nine were candidates in races not involving incumbents.

In 1972, 24% of the major party challengers in senatorial elections outspent their incumbent opponents.  The 1974 statistics for senatorial contests reveal substantially greater financial dominance by incumbents.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T37" name="F37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>Of the $3,781,254 in contributions raised in 1974 by congressional candidates over and above a $1,000-per-contributor limit, almost twice as much money went to incumbents as to major party challengers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T38" name="F38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the Act discriminates against challengers, because, while it limits contributions to all candidates, the Government makes available other material resources to incumbents.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F33" name="T33">n</a> 33, <em>supra.</em>  Yet, taking cognizance of the advantages and disadvantages of incumbency, there is little indication that the $1,000 contribution ceiling will consistently harm the prospects of challengers relative to incumbents.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T39" name="F39">Footnote 39</a>]</p>\n<p>Between September 1, 1973, and December 31, 1974, major party candidates for the House and Senate raised over $3,725,000 in contributions over and above $1,000 compared to $55,000 raised by minor party candidates in amounts exceeding the $1,000 contribution limit.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T40" name="F40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant Libertarian Party, according to estimates of its national chairman, has received only 10 contributions in excess of $1,000 out of a total of 4,000 contributions.  Even these 10 contributions would have been permissible under the Act if the donor did not earmark the funds for a particular candidate and did not exceed the over-all $25,000 contribution ceiling for the calendar year.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 608(b).  Similarly, appellants Conservative Victory Fund and American Conservative Union have received only an insignificant portion of their funding through contributions in excess of $1,000.  The affidavit of the executive director of the Conservative Victory Fund indicates that, in 1974, a typical fund-raising year, the Fund received approximately $152,000 through over 9,500 individual contributions.  Only one of the 9,500 contributions, an $8,000 contribution earmarked for a particular candidate, exceeded $1,000.  In 1972, the Fund received only three contributions in excess of $1,000, all of which might have been legal under the Act if not earmarked.  And between April 7, 1972, and February 28, 1975, the American Conservative Union did not receive any aggregate contributions exceeding $1,000.  Moreover, the Committee for a Constitutional Presidency -- McCarthy \'76, another appellant, engaged in a concerted effort to raise contributions in excess of $1,000 before the effective date of the Act, but obtained only five contributions in excess of $1,000.</p>\n<p>Although appellants claim that the $1,000 ceiling governing contributions to candidates will prevent the acquisition of seed money necessary to launch campaigns, the absence of experience under the Act prevents us from evaluating this assertion.  As appellees note, it is difficult to assess the effect of the contribution ceiling on the acquisition of seed money since candidates have not previously had to make a concerted effort to raise start-up funds in small amounts.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T41" name="F41">Footnote 41</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant Buckley was a minor party candidate in 1970 when he was elected to the United States Senate from the State of New York.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T42" name="F42">Footnote 42</a>]</p>\n<p>Although expenditures incidental to volunteer services would appear self-limiting, it is possible for a worker in a candidate\'s campaign to generate substantial travel expenses.

The definitions have two effects.  First, volunteer expenses that are counted as contributions by the volunteer would also constitute expenditures by the candidate\'s campaign.  Second, some volunteer expenses would qualify as contributions whereas others would constitute independent expenditures.  The statute distinguishes between independent expenditures by individuals and campaign expenditures on the basis of whether the candidate, an authorized committee of the candidate, or an agent of the candidate "authorized or requested" the expenditure.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(c)(2)(B)(ii), (e)(1); S.Rep. No. 93-689, p. 18 (1974); H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 6 (1974).  As a result, only travel that is "authorized or requested" by the candidate or his agents would involve incidental expenses chargeable against the volunteer\'s contribution limit and the candidate\'s expenditure ceiling.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F53" name="T53">n</a> 53, <em>infra.</em>  Should a person independently travel across the country to participate in a campaign, any unreimbursed travel expenses would not be treated as a contribution.  This interpretation is not only consistent with the statute and the legislative history, but is also necessary to avoid the administrative chaos that would be produced if each volunteer and candidate had to keep track of amounts spent on unsolicited travel in order to comply with the Act\'s contribution and expenditure ceilings and the reporting and disclosure provisions.  The distinction between contributions and expenditures is also discussed at  <a href="#F53" name="T53">n</a> 53, <em>infra</em> and in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#72">424 U.

The statute provides some limited exceptions through various exclusions from the otherwise comprehensive definition of "expenditure."  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 591(f).  The most important exclusions are:  (1) "any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate," \xc2\xa7 591(f)(4)(A), and (2) "any communication by any membership organization or corporation to its members or stockholders, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office," \xc2\xa7 591(f)(4)(C).  In addition, the Act sets substantially higher limits for personal expenditures by a candidate in connection with his own campaign, \xc2\xa7 608(a), expenditures by national and state committees of political parties that succeed in placing a candidate on the ballot, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 591(i), 608(f), and total campaign expenditures by candidates, \xc2\xa7 608(c).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T46" name="F46">Footnote 46</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 608(i) provides that any person convicted of exceeding any of the contribution or expenditure limitations "shall be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T47" name="F47">Footnote 47</a>]</p>\n<p>Several of the parties have suggested that problems of ambiguity regarding the application of \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) to specific campaign speech could be handled by requesting advisory opinions from the Commission.  While a comprehensive series of advisory opinions or a rule delineating what expenditures are "relative to a clearly identified candidate" might alleviate the provision\'s vagueness problems, reliance on the Commission is unacceptable because the vast majority of individuals and groups subject to criminal sanctions for violating \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) do not have a right to obtain an advisory opinion from the Commission.  <em>See</em> 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 437f (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Section 437f(a) of Title 2 accords only candidates, federal officeholders, and political committees the right to request advisory opinions and directs that the Commission "shall render an advisory opinion, in writing, within a reasonable time" concerning specific planned activities or transactions of any such individual or committee.  The powers delegated to the Commission thus do not assure that the vagueness concerns will be remedied prior to the chilling of political discussion by individuals and groups in this or future election years.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T48" name="F48">Footnote 48</a>]</p>\n<p>In such circumstances, vague laws may not only "trap the innocent by not providing fair warning" or foster "arbitrary and discriminatory application," but also operate to inhibit protected expression by inducing "citizens to <em>steer far wider of the unlawful zone\' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\'"  <em>Grayned v.

The latter subsection provides that expenditures "authorized or requested by the candidate, an authorized committee of the candidate, or an agent of the candidate" are to be treated as expenditures of the candidate and contributions by the person or group making the expenditure.  The House and Senate Reports provide guidance in differentiating individual expenditures that are contributions and candidate expenditures under \xc2\xa7 608(c)(2)(b) from those treated as independent expenditures subject to the \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) ceiling.  The House Report speaks of independent expenditures as costs "incurred without the request or consent of a candidate or his agent."  H.R.Rep. No. 93-1239, p. 6 (1974).  The Senate Report addresses the issue in greater detail.  It provides an example illustrating the distinction between "authorized or requested" expenditures excluded from \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1) and independent expenditures governed by \xc2\xa7 608(e)(1):</p>\n<p>"[A] person might purchase billboard advertisements endorsing a candidate.

The Conference substitute adopted the provision of the Senate bill dealing with expenditures by any person "authorized or requested" to make an expenditure by the candidate or his agents.  S.Conf.Rep. No. 93-1237, p. 55 (1974).  In view of this legislative history and the purposes of the Act, we find that the "authorized or requested" standard of the Act operates to treat all expenditures placed in cooperation with or with the consent of a candidate, his agents, or an authorized committee of the candidate as contributions subject to the limitations set forth in \xc2\xa7 608(b).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T54" name="F54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellees mistakenly rely on this Court\'s decision in <em>CSC v.

This Act also initiated the dollar check-off provision now contained in 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6096 (1970 ed., Supp. IV).

Chapter 95 thereof provided public financing of general election campaigns for President; this legislation was to become effective for the 1976 election and is substantially the same as the present scheme.

New parties will be unfinanced, however, only if they are unable to get private financial support, which presumably reflects a general lack of public support for the party.  Public financing of some candidates does not make private fundraising for others any more difficult; indeed, the elimination of private contributions to major party Presidential candidates might make more private money available to minority candidates.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T129" name="F129">Footnote 129</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants dispute the relevance of this answer to their argument on the ground that they will not be able to raise money to equal major party spending.  As a practical matter, however, Subtitle H does not enhance the major parties\' ability to campaign; it substitutes public funding for what the parties would raise privately and additionally imposes an expenditure limit.  If a party cannot raise funds privately, there are legitimate reasons not to provide public funding, which would effectively facilitate hopeless candidacies.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T130" name="F130">Footnote 130</a>]</p>\n<p>Our only prior decision dealing with a system of public financing, <em>American Party of Texas v.

Texas required major parties -- there called "political parties" -- to nominate candidates by primaries, and the State reimbursed the parties for some of the expenses incurred in holding the primaries.  But Texas did not subsidize other parties for the expenses involved in qualifying for the ballot, and this denial was claimed to be a denial of equal protection of the laws.

That formula, however, might unfairly favor incumbents, since their major party challengers would receive less financial assistance.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

Whatever merit the point may have, which is questionable on the basis of the record before the Court, it is answered in our treatment of the contribution limits.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#23">424 U.

Congress could readily have concluded, however, that the matching formula was inappropriate for the general election.  The problems in determining the relative strength of candidates at the primaries stage of the campaign are far greater than after a candidate has obtained the nomination of a major party.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 93 689, p. 6 (1974).  It might be eminently reasonable, therefore, to employ a matching formula for primary elections related to popular support evidenced by numerous smaller contributions, yet inappropriate for general election financing as inconsistent with the congressional effort to remove the influence of private contributions and to relieve candidates of the burden of fundraising.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T137" name="F137">Footnote 137</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Williams v.

Although "contributions to a named candidate made to any political committee" are within \xc2\xa7 608(b)(1) if the committee is authorized in writing by a candidate to accept contributions, \xc2\xa7 608(b)(4)(A), contributions to a party not for the benefit of any specific candidate would apparently not be subject to the $1,000 ceiling.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7 608(b)(4)(A) governs only party organizations authorized by a candidate in writing to accept contributions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T142" name="F142">Footnote 142</a>]</p>\n<p>With respect to the denial of funds to candidates who may not be affiliated with a "political party" for the purposes of public financing, <em>see</em> <a href="#F118" name="T118">n</a> 118, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T143" name="F143">Footnote 143</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants argue that this reasoning from <em>Katzenbach v.

Only 7% of the Illinois voters could have blocked a candidate from qualifying for the ballot, even though the state-wide elections were decided by straight majority vote.  The clear purpose was to keep any person from being nominated without support in downstate counties making up only 7% of the vote, but those same voters could not come close to defeating a candidate in the general election.  There is no similar restriction here on the opportunity to vote for any candidate, and the 20-state requirement is not an unreasonable method of measuring a candidate\'s breadth of support.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#103">424 U.

Taxpayers are entitled to a deduction from ordinary income for political contributions up to $100, or $200 on a joint return.  \xc2\xa7 218.  Appellants note that a married couple in the 70% tax bracket could give $500 to a candidate and claim the full deduction allowed by \xc2\xa7 218, thus reducing their tax liability by $140.  The matching funds increase the effective contribution to $1,000, and the total cost to the contributors is $360.  But the appellants have disregarded a myriad of other possibilities.  For example, taxpayers also have the option of claiming a tax credit up to $25, or $50 on a joint return, for one-half of their political contributions.  \xc2\xa7 41.  Any married couple could give $100 to a candidate, claim the full $50 credit, and matching thus allows a contribution of $200 at a cost of only $50 to the contributors.  Because this example and others involve greater subsidization -- 75% against 64% -- of smaller contributions than is involved in appellants\' hypothesis, one cannot say that the matching formula unfairly favors wealthy interests or large contributors.  Moreover, the effect noted by appellants diminishes as the size of individual contributions approaches $1,000.</p>\n<p>Finally, these examples clearly reveal that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 41 and 218 afford public subsidies for candidates, but appellants have raised no constitutional challenge to the provisions, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T147" name="F147">Footnote 147</a>]</p>\n<p>Our responses to the certified constitutional questions pertaining to public financing of Presidential election campaigns are:</p>\n<p>5.

Any person may file, and the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate shall refer, believed or apparent civil or criminal violations to the Commission.  Upon receipt of a complaint or referral, as the case may be, the Commission is directed to notify the person involved and to report the violation to the Attorney General or to make an investigation.  \xc2\xa7 437g(a)(2).  The Commission shall conduct a hearing at that person\'s request.  \xc2\xa7 437g(a)(4).  If, after its investigation, the Commission "determines . . . that there is reason to believe" that a "violation of this Act," <em>i.e.,</em> a civil violation, has occurred or is about to occur, it "may endeavor to correct such violation by informal methods," failing which, the Commission "may institute a civil action for relief."  \xc2\xa7 437g(a)(5).  Finally, paragraph (6) provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"The Commission shall refer apparent violations to the appropriate law enforcement authorities to the extent that violations of provisions of chapter 29 of Title 18 are involved, <em>or</em> if the Commission is unable to correct <em>apparent violations of this Act</em> under the authority given it by paragraph (5), or if the Commission determines that any such referral is appropriate."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 437g(a)(6) (emphasis added).  While it is clear that the Commission has a duty to refer apparent criminal violations either upon their initial receipt or after an investigation, it would appear at the very least that the Commission, which has "primary jurisdiction" with respect to civil enforcement, \xc2\xa7 437c(b), has the sole discretionary power "to determine" whether or not a civil violation has occurred or is about to occur, and consequently whether or not informal or judicial remedies will be pursued.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T154" name="F154">Footnote 154</a>]</p>\n<p>Such a finding is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T155" name="F155">Footnote 155</a>]</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 437c(a)(1), set forth in the Appendix to this opinion, <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#161">424 U.

Its basic holding, in answer to question 8(a), was that "Congress has the constitutional authority to establish and appoint [the Commission] to carry out appropriate legislative functions."  171 U.S.App.D.C. at 244, 519 F.2d at 890.  Appellants\' claim, embodied in questions 8(b) through 8(f), that the Commission\'s powers go well beyond "legislative functions" and are facially invalid was, in an overarching sense, not ripe, since</p>\n<p>"[w]hether particular powers are predominantly executive or judicial, or insufficiently related to the exercise of appropriate legislative power is an abstract question . . . better decided in the context of a particular factual controversy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 243, 519 F.2d at 892.  While some of the statutory grants such as civil enforcement and candidate disqualification powers (questions 8(c) and 8(e)) raised, in the court\'s view, "very serious constitutional questions," only the power of the Commission to issue advisory opinions under \xc2\xa7 437f(a) was ripe in the context of an attack on Congress\' method of appointment.  Even then, beyond the Commission\'s power to inform the public of its interpretations, the question whether Congress under \xc2\xa7 437f(b) could validly give substantive <em>effect</em> to the Commission\'s opinions in later civil and criminal enforcement proceedings should, the Court of Appeals held, await a case in which a defense based on \xc2\xa7 437f(b) was asserted.  Finally, the question of the Commission\'s power under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 9008(d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) to authorize nominating convention expenditures in excess of the statutory limits (question 8(f)) was found ripe because appellants had not challenged it in relation to the method of appointment, but had asserted only that 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 9008(d)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) vested excessive discretion in the Commission.  The Court of Appeals found that Congress had provided sufficient guidelines to withstand that attack.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals accordingly answered the six certified questions as follows:</p>\n<p>"8.

We need not respond to questions 3(g), 3(i), 4(b), and 7(f), <em>id.</em> at 250-251, 519 F.2d at 899-900 (Appendix A), to resolve the issues presented.</p>\n<p>* Based upon Federal Election Campaign Laws, compiled by the Senate Library for the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (1975).</p>\n<p>* So in original.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>For reasons set forth more fully later, I dissent from those parts of the Court\'s holding sustaining the statutory provisions (a) for disclosure of small contributions, (b) for limitations on contributions, and (c) for public financing of Presidential campaigns.  In my view, the Act\'s disclosure scheme is impermissibly broad and violative of the First Amendment as it relates to reporting contributions in excess of $10 and $100.  The contribution limitations infringe on First Amendment liberties and suffer from the same infirmities that the Court correctly sees in the expenditure ceilings.  The system for public financing of Presidential campaigns is, in my judgment, an impermissible intrusion by the Government into the traditionally private political process.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the Court\'s result does violence to the intent of Congress in this comprehensive scheme of campaign finance.  By dissecting the Act bit by bit, and casting off vital parts, the Court fails to recognize that the whole of this Act is greater than the sum of its parts.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 424 U. S. 236</a></p><p> Congress intended to regulate all aspects of federal campaign finances, but what remains after today\'s holding leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress contemplated.  I question whether the residue leaves a workable program.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p><em>DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS\n</em></p>\n<p>Disclosure is, in principle, the salutary and constitutional remedy for most of the ills Congress was seeking to alleviate.  I therefore agree fully with the broad proposition that public disclosure of contributions by individuals and by entities -- particularly corporations and labor unions -- is an effective means of revealing the type of political support that is sometimes coupled with expectations of special favors or rewards.  That disclosure impinges on First Amendment rights is conceded by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#666">424 U. S. 666</a></span>, but, given the objectives to which disclosure is directed, I agree that the need for disclosure outweighs individual constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>Disclosure is, however, subject to First Amendment limitations which are to be defined by looking to the relevant public interests.  The legitimate public interest is the elimination of the appearance and reality of corrupting influences.  Serious dangers to the very processes of government justify disclosure of contributions of such dimensions reasonably thought likely to purchase special favors.  These fears have been at the root of the Court\'s prior decisions upholding disclosure requirements, and I therefore have no disagreement, for example, with <em>Burroughs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html">290 U. S. 534</a></span> (1934).</p>\n<p>The Court\'s theory, however, goes beyond permissible limits.  Under the Court\'s view, disclosure serves broad informational purposes, enabling the public to be fully informed on matters of acute public interest.  Forced disclosure of one aspect of a citizen\'s political activity, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 424 U. S. 237</a></p><p> under this analysis, serves the public right to know.  This open-ended approach is the only plausible justification for the otherwise irrationally low ceilings of $10 and $100 for anonymous contributions.  The burdens of these low ceilings seem to me obvious, and the Court does not try to question this.  With commendable candor, the Court acknowledges:</p>\n<p>"It is undoubtedly true that public disclosure of contributions to candidates and political parties will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#68">424 U. S. 68</a></span>.  Examples come readily to mind.  Rank-and-file union members or rising junior executives may now think twice before making even modest contributions to a candidate who is disfavored by the union or management hierarchy.  Similarly, potential contributors may well decline to take the obvious risks entailed in making a reportable contribution to the opponent of a well entrenched incumbent.  This fact of political life did not go unnoticed by the Congress:</p>\n<p>"The disclosure provisions really have, in fact, made it difficult for challengers to challenge incumbents."</p>\n<p>120 Cong.Rec. 34392 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Long).  <em>See Pollard v. Roberts,</em> 283 F.Supp. 248 (ED Ark.), <em>aff\'d per curiam,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/14/case.html">393 U. S. 14</a></span> (1968).</p>\n<p>The public right to know ought not be absolute when its exercise reveals private political convictions.  Secrecy, like privacy, is not <em>per se</em> criminal.  On the contrary, secrecy and privacy as to political preferences and convictions are fundamental in a free society.  For example, one of the great political reforms was the advent of the secret ballot as a universal practice.  Similarly, the enlightened labor legislation of our time has enshrined the secrecy of choice of a bargaining representative for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 424 U. S. 238</a></p><p> workers.  In other contexts, this Court has seen to it that governmental power cannot be used to force a citizen to disclose his private affiliations, <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span> (1963), even without a record reflecting any systematic harassment or retaliation, as in <em>Shelton v. Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/479/case.html">364 U. S. 479</a></span> (1960).  For me it is far too late in the day to recognize an ill-defined "public interest" to breach the historic safeguards guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>We all seem to agree that, whatever the legitimate public interest in this area, proper analysis requires us to scrutinize the precise means employed to implement that interest.  The balancing test used by the Court requires that fair recognition be given to competing interests.  With respect, I suggest the Court has failed to give the traditional standing to some of the First Amendment values at stake here.  Specifically, it has failed to confine the particular exercise of governmental power within limits reasonably required.</p>\n<p>"In every case, the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom."</p>\n<p><em>Cantwell v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html">310 U. S. 296</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html#304">310 U. S. 304</a></span> (1940).  "Unduly" must mean not more than necessary, and, until today, the Court has recognized this criterion in First Amendment cases:</p>\n<p>"In the area of First Amendment freedoms, government has the duty to confine itself to the least intrusive regulations which are adequate for the purpose."</p>\n<p><em>Lamont v. Postmaster General,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/301/case.html">381 U. S. 301</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/301/case.html#310">381 U. S. 310</a></span> (1965) (BRENNAN, J., concurring).  (Emphasis added.)  Similarly, the Court has said:</p>\n<p>"[E]ven though the governmental purpose be legitimate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 424 U. S. 239</a></p><p> and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.  The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose."</p>\n<p><em>Shelton v. Tucker, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/479/case.html#488">364 U. S. 488</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In light of these views, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] it seems to me that the threshold limits fixed at $10 and $100 for anonymous contributions are constitutionally impermissible on their face.  As the Court\'s opinion notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#83">424 U. S. 83</a></span>, Congress gave little or no thought, one way or the other, to these limits, but rather lifted figures out of a 65-year-old statute. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  As we are all painfully aware, the 1976 dollar is not what it used to be and is surely not the dollar of 1910.  Ten dollars in 1976 will, for example, purchase only what $1.68 would buy in 1910.  United States Dept. of Labor, Handbook of Labor Statistics 1975, p. 313 (Dec.1975).  To argue that a 1976 contribution of $10 or $100 entails a risk of corruption or its appearance is simply too extravagant to be maintained.  No public right to know justifies the compelled disclosure of such contributions, at the risk of discouraging them.  There is, in short, no relation whatever between the means used and the legitimate goal of ventilating possible undue influence.  Congress has used a shotgun to kill wrens as well as hawks. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 424 U. S. 240</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In saying that the lines drawn by Congress are "not wholly without rationality," the Court plainly fails to apply the traditional test:</p>\n<p>"Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching on our most precious freedoms."</p>\n<p><em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#438">371 U. S. 438</a></span> (1938).  <em>See, e.g., Aptheker v.

Robel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/258/case.html">389 U. S. 258</a></span> (1967); <em>Lamont v. Postmaster General, supra.</em>  The Court\'s abrupt departure [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] from traditional standards is wrong; surely a greater burden rests on Congress than merely to avoid "irrationality" when regulating in the core area of the First Amendment.  Even taking the Court at its word, the particular dollar amounts fixed by Congress that must be reported to the Commission fall short of meeting the test of rationality when measured by the goals sought to be achieved.</p>\n<p>Finally, no legitimate public interest has been shown in forcing the disclosure of modest contributions that are the prime support of new, unpopular, or unfashionable political causes.  There is no realistic possibility that such modest donations will have a corrupting influence, especially on parties that enjoy only "minor" status.  Major parties would not notice them; minor parties need them.  Furthermore, as the Court candidly recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#70">424 U. S. 70</a></span>, minor parties and new parties tend to be sharply ideological in character, and the public can readily discern where such parties stand, without resorting to the indirect device of recording the names of financial supporters.  To hold, as the Court has, that privacy must sometimes yield to congressional investigations of alleged subversion is quite different from making domestic political </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 424 U. S. 241</a></p><p> partisans give up privacy.  <em>Cf. Estland v. United States Servicemen\'s Fund,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/491/case.html">421 U. S. 491</a></span> (1975).  In any event, the dangers to First Amendment rights here are too great.  Flushing out the names of supporters of minority parties will plainly have a deterrent effect on potential contributors, a consequence readily admitted by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#71">424 U. S. 71</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#83">424 U. S. 83</a></span>, and supported by the record. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>I would therefore hold unconstitutional the provisions requiring reporting of contributions of more than $10 and to make a public record of the name, address, and occupation of a contributor of more than $100.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p><em>CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITS\n</em></p>\n<p>I agree fully with that part of the Court\'s opinion that holds unconstitutional the limitations the Act puts on campaign expenditures which</p>\n<p>"place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#58">424 U. S. 58</a></span>-59.  Yet when it approves similarly stringent limitations on contributions, the Court ignores the reasons it finds so persuasive in the context of expenditures.  For me, contributions and expenditures are two sides of the same First Amendment coin.</p>\n<p>By limiting campaign contributions, the Act restricts the amount of money that will be spent on political activity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 424 U. S. 242</a></p><p> -- and does so directly.  Appellees argue, as the Court notes, that these limits will "act as a brake on the skyrocketing cost of political campaigns," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#26">424 U. S. 26</a></span>.  In treating campaign expenditure limitations, the Court says that the</p>\n<p>"First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one\'s political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#57">424 U. S. 57</a></span>.  Limiting contributions, as a practical matter, will limit expenditures and will put an effective ceiling on the amount of political activity and debate that the Government will permit to take place.  The argument that the ceiling is not, after all, very low as matters now stand gives little comfort for the future, since the Court elsewhere notes the rapid inflation in the cost of political campaigning. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#57">424 U. S. 57</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to separate the two communicative aspects of political contributions -- the "moral" support that the gift itself conveys, which the Court suggests is the same whether the gift is $10 or $10,000, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] and the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 424 U. S. 243</a></p><p> fact that money translates into communication. The Court dismisses the effect of the limitations on the second aspect of contributions:  "[T]he transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#21">424 U. S. 21</a></span>.  On this premise -- that contribution limitations restrict only the speech of "someone other than the contributor" -- rests the Court\'s justification for treating contributions differently from expenditures.  The premise is demonstrably flawed; the contribution limitations will, in specific instances, limit exactly the same political activity that the expenditure ceilings limit, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] and at least one of the "expenditure" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 424 U. S. 244</a></p><p> limitations the Court finds objectionable operates precisely like the "contribution" limitations. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s attempt to distinguish the communication inherent in political contributions from the speech aspects of political expenditures simply "will not wash."  We do little but engage in word games unless we recognize that people -- candidates and contributors -- spend money on political activity because they wish to communicate ideas, and their constitutional interest in doing so is precisely the same whether they or someone else utters the words.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to make the Act seem less restrictive by casting the problem as one that goes to freedom of association, rather than freedom of speech.  I have long thought freedom of association and freedom of expression were two peas from the same pod.  The contribution limitations of the Act impose a restriction on certain forms of associational activity that are, for the most part, as the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#29">424 U. S. 29</a></span> harmless in fact.  And the restrictions are hardly incidental in their effect upon particular campaigns.  Judges are ill-equipped to gauge the precise impact of legislation, but a law that impinges upon First Amendment rights requires us to make the attempt.  It is not simply speculation to think that the limitations on contributions will foreclose some candidacies. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The limitations will also alter the nature of some electoral contests drastically. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 424 U. S. 245</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At any rate, the contribution limits are a far more severe restriction on First Amendment activity than the sort of "chilling" legislation for which the Court has shown such extraordinary concern in the past.  <em>See, e.g., Cohen v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/case.html">403 U. S. 15</a></span> (1971); <em>see also</em> cases reviewed in <em>Miller v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U. S. 15</a></span> (1973); <em>Redrup v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/767/case.html">386 U. S. 767</a></span> (1967); <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/413/case.html">383 U. S. 413</a></span> (1966).  If such restraints can be justified at all, they must be justified by the very strongest of state interests.  With this much the Court clearly agrees; the Court even goes so far as to note that legislation cutting into these important interests must employ "means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">424 U. S. 25</span>.</p>\n<p>After a bow to the "weighty interests" Congress meant to serve, the Court then forsakes this analysis in one sentence:</p>\n<p>"Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#28">424 U. S. 28</a></span>.  In striking down the limitations on campaign expenditures, the Court relies in part on its conclusion that other means -- namely, disclosure and contribution ceilings -- will adequately serve the statute\'s aim.  It is not clear why the same analysis is not also appropriate in weighing the need for contribution ceilings in addition to disclosure requirements.  Congress may well be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 424 U. S. 246</a></p><p> entitled to conclude that disclosure was a "partial measure," but I had not thought until today that Congress could enact its conclusions in the First Amendment area into laws immune from the most searching review by this Court.</p>\n<p>Finally, it seems clear to me that, in approving these limitations on contributions, the Court must rest upon the proposition that "pooling" money is fundamentally different from other forms of associational or joint activity.  <em>But see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#66">424 U. S. 66</a></span>.  I see only two possible ways in which money differs from volunteer work, endorsements, and the like.  Money can be used to buy favors, because an unscrupulous politician can put it to personal use; second, giving money is a less visible form of associational activity.  With respect to the first problem, the Act does not attempt to do any more than the bribery laws to combat this sort of corruption.  In fact, the Act does not reach at all, and certainly the contribution limits do not reach, forms of "association" that can be fully as corrupt as a contribution intended as a <em>quid pro quo</em> -- such as the eleventh-hour endorsement by a former rival, obtained for the promise of a federal appointment.  This underinclusiveness is not a constitutional flaw, but it demonstrates that the contribution limits do not clearly focus on this first distinction.  To the extent Congress thought that the second problem, the lesser visibility of contributions, required that money be treated differently from other forms of associational activity, disclosure laws are the simple and wholly efficacious answer; they make the invisible apparent.</p>\n<p><em>(3)\n</em></p>\n<p><em>PUBLIC FINANCING\n</em></p>\n<p>I dissent from  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#85">424 U. S. </a></span></p>\n<p>Since the turn of this century, when the idea of Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 424 U. S. 247</a></p><p> subsidies for political campaigns first was broached, there has been no lack of realization that the use of funds from the public treasury to subsidize political activity of private individuals would produce substantial and profound questions about the nature of our democratic society.  The Majority Leader of the Senate, although supporting such legislation in 1967, said that "the implications of these questions . . . go to the very heart and structure of the Government of the Republic." [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The Solicitor General, in his <em>amicus curiae</em> brief, states that "the issues involved here are of indisputable moment." [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  He goes on to express his view that public financing will have "profound effects in the way candidates approach issues and each other." [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Public financing, he notes,</p>\n<p>"affects the role of the party in campaigns for office, changes the role of the incumbent government <em>vis-a-vis</em> all parties, and affects the relative strengths and strategies of candidates <em>vis-a-vis</em> each other and their party\'s leaders. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Court chooses to treat this novel public financing of political activity as simply another congressional appropriation whose validity is "necessary and proper" to Congress\' power to regulate and reform elections and primaries, relying on <em>United States v. Classic,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/299/case.html">313 U. S. 299</a></span> (1941), and <em>Burroughs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html">290 U. S. 534</a></span> (1934).  No holding of this Court is directly in point, because no federal scheme allocating public funds in a comparable manner has ever been before us.  The uniqueness of the plan is not relevant, of course, to whether Congress has power to enact it.  Indeed, I do not question the power of Congress to regulate elections; nor do I </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 424 U. S. 248</a></p><p> challenge the broad proposition that the General Welfare Clause is a grant, not a limitation, of power.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">M\'Culloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#420">17 U. S. 420</a></span> (1819); United States v.

S. 66</a></span> (1936).</p>\n<p>I would, however, fault the Court for not adequately analyzing and meeting head on the issue whether public financial assistance to the private political activity of individual citizens and parties is a legitimate expenditure of public funds.  The public monies at issue here are not being employed simply to police the integrity of the electoral process or to provide a forum for the use of all participants in the political dialogue, as would, for example, be the case if free broadcast time were granted.  Rather, we are confronted with the Government\'s actual financing, out of general revenues, a segment of the political debate itself.  As Senator Howard Baker remarked during the debate on this legislation:</p>\n<p>"I think there is something politically incestuous about the Government financing and, I believe, inevitably then regulating, the day-to-day procedures by which the Government is selected. . . . "</p>\n<p>"I think it is extraordinarily important that the Government not control the machinery by which the public expresses the range of its desires, demands, and dissent."</p>\n<p>120 Cong.Rec. 8202 (1974).  If this "incest" affected only the issue of the wisdom of the plan, it would be none of the concern of judges.  But, in my view, the inappropriateness of subsidizing, from general revenues, the actual political dialogue of the people -- the process which begets the Government itself -- is as basic to our national tradition as the separation of church and state also deriving from the First Amendment, <em>see Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html">403 U.

[<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#93">424 U. S. 93</a></span> n. 126.  But the Court points to no basis for predicting that the historical pattern of "varying measures of control and surveillance," <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#621">403 U. S. 621</a></span>, which usually accompany grants from Government will not also follow in this case. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Up to now, the Court has always been extraordinarily sensitive, when dealing with First Amendment rights, to the risk that the "flag tends to follow the dollars."  Yet, here, where Subtitle H specifically requires the auditing of records of political parties and candidates by Government inspectors, [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>] the Court shows </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 424 U. S. 250</a></p><p> little sensitivity to the danger it has so strongly condemned in other contexts.  <em>See, e.g., Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span> (1947).  Up to now, this Court has scrupulously refrained, absent claims of invidious discrimination, [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>] from entering the arena of intraparty disputes concerning the seating of convention delegates.  <em>Graham v. Fong Eu,</em> 403 F.Supp. 37 (ND Cal.1975), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 423 U.S. 1067 (1976); <em>Cousins v. Wigoda,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/case.html">419 U.

An obvious underlying basis for this reluctance is that delegate selection and the management of political conventions have been considered a strictly private political matter, not the business of Government inspectors.  But once the Government finances these national conventions by the expenditure of millions of dollars from the public treasury, we may be providing a springboard for later attempts to impose a whole range of requirements on delegate selection and convention activities.  Does this foreshadow judicial decisions allowing the federal courts to "monitor" these conventions to assure compliance with court orders or regulations?</p>\n<p>Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that Congress could validly appropriate public money to subsidize private political activity, it has gone about the task in Subtitle H in a manner which is not, in my view, free of constitutional infirmity. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  I do not question that Congress has "wide discretion in the manner of prescribing details of expenditures" in some contexts, <em>Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/308/case.html">301 U. S. 308</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/301/308/case.html#321">301 U. S. 321</a></span> (1937).  Here, however, Congress has not itself appropriated a specific sum to attain the ends of the Act, but has delegated to a limited group </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 424 U. S. 251</a></p><p> of citizens those who file tax returns -- the power to allocate general revenue for the Act\'s purposes -- and of course only a small percentage of that limited group has exercised the power.  There is nothing to assure that the "fund" will actually be adequate for the Act\'s objectives.  Thus, I find it difficult to see a rational basis for concluding that this scheme would, in fact, attain the stated purposes of the Act when its own funding scheme affords no real idea of the amount of the available funding.</p>\n<p>I agree with MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST that the scheme approved by the Court today invidiously discriminates against minor parties.  Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> the constitutionality of the over-all scheme, there is a legitimate governmental interest in requiring a group to make a "preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support."  <em>Jenness v. Fortson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html">403 U. S. 431</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/431/case.html#442">403 U. S. 442</a></span> (1971).  But the present system could preclude or severely hamper access to funds before a given election by a group or an individual who might, at the time of the election, reflect the views of a major segment or even a majority of the electorate.  The fact that there have been few drastic realignments in our basic two-party structure in 200 years is no constitutional justification for freezing the <em>status quo</em> of the present major parties at the expense of such future political movements.  <em>Cf.</em> discussion <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#73">424 U. S. 73</a></span>.  When and if some minority party achieves majority status, Congress can readily deal with any problems that arise.  In short, I see grave risks in legislation, enacted by incumbents of the major political parties, which distinctly disadvantages minor parties or independent candidates.  This Court has, until today, been particularly cautious when dealing with enactments that tend to perpetuate those who control legislative power.  <em>See Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 570</span> (1964).</p>\n<p>I would also find unconstitutional the system of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 424 U. S. 252</a></p><p> matching grants which makes a candidate\'s ability to amass private funds the sole criterion for eligibility for public funds.  Such an arrangement can put at serious disadvantage a candidate with a potentially large, widely diffused -- but poor -- constituency.  The ability of a candidate\'s supporters to help pay for his campaign cannot be equated with their willingness to cast a ballot for him.  <em>See Lubin v. Panish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/case.html">415 U. S. 709</a></span> (1974); <em>Bullock v. Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/134/case.html">405 U. S. 134</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p><em>(4)\n</em></p>\n<p>I cannot join in the attempt to determine which parts of the Act can survive review here.  The statute as it now stands is unworkable and inequitable.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court\'s holding that the Act\'s restrictions on expenditures made "relative to a clearly identified candidate," independent of any candidate or his committee, are unconstitutional.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#39">424 U. S. 39</a></span>-51.  Paradoxically, the Court upholds the limitations on individual contributions, which embrace precisely the same sort of expenditures "relative to a clearly identified candidate" if those expenditures are "authorized or requested" by the "candidate or his agents."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#24">424 U. S. 24</a></span> n. 25.  The Act, as cut back by the Court, thus places intolerable pressure on the distinction between "authorized" and "unauthorized" expenditures on behalf of a candidate; even those with the most sanguine hopes for the Act might well concede that the distinction cannot be maintained.  As the Senate Report on the bill said:</p>\n<p>"Whether campaigns are funded privately or publicly . . . controls are imperative if Congress is to enact meaningful limits on direct contributions.  Otherwise, wealthy individuals limited to a $3,000 direct contribution [$1,000 in the bill as finally enacted] could also purchase one hundred thousand </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 424 U. S. 253</a></p><p> dollars\' worth of advertisements for a favored candidate.  Such a loophole would render direct contribution limits virtually meaningless."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 93-689, p. 18 (1974).  Given the unfortunate record of past attempts to draw distinctions of this kind, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#61">424 U. S. 61</a></span>-62, it is not too much to predict that the Court\'s holding will invite avoidance, if not evasion, of the intent of the Act, with "independent" committees undertaking "unauthorized" activities in order to escape the limits on contributions.  The Court\'s effort to blend First Amendment principles and practical politics has produced a strange offspring.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Act -- or so much as the Court leaves standing -- creates significant inequities.  A candidate with substantial personal resources is now given by the Court a clear advantage over his less affluent opponents, who are constrained by law in fundraising, because the Court holds that the "First Amendment cannot tolerate" any restrictions on spending.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#59">424 U. S. 59</a></span>.  Minority parties, whose situation is difficult enough under an Act that excludes them from public funding, are prevented from accepting large single-donor contributions.  At the same time the Court sustains the provision aimed at broadening the base of political support by requiring candidates to seek a greater number of small contributors, it sustains the unrealistic disclosure thresholds of $10 and $100 that I believe will deter those hoped-for small contributions.  Minor parties must now compete for votes against two major parties whose expenditures will be vast.  Finally, the Act\'s distinction between contributions in money and contributions in services remains, with only the former being subject to any limits.  As Judge Tamm put it in dissent from the Court of Appeals\' opinion:</p>\n<p>"[T]he classification created only regulates certain </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 424 U. S. 254</a></p><p> types of disproportional influences.  Under section 591(e)(5), services are excluded from contributions.  This allows the housewife to volunteer time that might cost well over $1000 to hire on the open market, while limiting her neighbor who works full-time to a regulated contribution.  It enhances the disproportional influence of groups who command large quantities of these volunteer services, and will continue to magnify this inequity by not allowing for an inflation adjustment to the contribution limit.  It leads to the absurd result that a lawyer\'s contribution of services to aid a candidate in complying with FECA is exempt, but his first amendment activity is regulated if he falls ill and hires a replacement."</p>\n<p>171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 266, 519 F.2d 821, 915 (1975).  One need not call problems of this order equal protection violations to recognize that the contribution limitations of the Act create grave inequities that are aggravated by the Court\'s interpretation of the Act.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s piecemeal approach fails to give adequate consideration to the integrated nature of this legislation.  A serious question is raised, which the Court does not consider: [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] when central segments, key operative provisions, of this Act are stricken, can what remains function in anything like the way Congress intended?  The incongruities are obvious.  The Commission is now eliminated, yet its very purpose was to guide candidates and campaign workers -- and their accountants and lawyers -- through an intricate statutory maze where a misstep can lead to imprisonment.  All candidates can now spend freely; affluent candidates, after today, can spend their own money without limit; yet, contributions for the ordinary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 424 U. S. 255</a></p><p> candidate are severely restricted in amount -- and small contributors are deterred.  I cannot believe that Congress would have enacted a statutory scheme containing such incongruous and inequitable provisions.</p>\n<p>Although the statute contains a severability clause, 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 454 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), such a clause is not an "inexorable command." [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  <em>Dorchy v. Kansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/286/case.html">264 U. S. 286</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/264/286/case.html#290">264 U. S. 290</a></span> (1924).  The clause creates a rebuttable presumption that "<em>eliminating invalid parts, the legislature would have been satisfied with what remained.\'"  <em>Welsh v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/333/case.html">398 U. S. 333</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/333/case.html#364">398 U. S. 364</a></span> (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring, quoting from <em>Champlin Rfg. Co. v.

Here, just as the presumption of constitutionality of a statute has been overcome to the point that major proportions and chapters of the Act have been declared unconstitutional, for me, the presumption of severability has been rebutted.  To invoke a severability clause to salvage parts of a comprehensive, integrated statutory scheme, which parts, standing alone, are unworkable and in many aspects unfair, exalts a formula at the expense of the broad objectives of Congress.\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, I agree with the Court that the members of the Federal Election Commission were unconstitutionally appointed.  However, I disagree that we should give blanket <em>de facto</em> validation to all actions of the Commission undertaken until today.  The issue is not before us, and we cannot know what acts we are ratifying.  I would leave this issue to the District Court to resolve if and when any challenges are brought.</p>\n<p>In the past two decades, the Court has frequently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 424 U. S. 256</a></p><p> spoken of the broad coverage of the First Amendment, especially in the area of political dialogue:</p>\n<p>"[T]o assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,"</p>\n<p><em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U.

S. 484</a></span> (1957); and</p>\n<p>"[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs . . . [including] discussions of candidates . . . ,"</p>\n<p><em>Mills v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html">384 U. S. 214</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html#218">384 U. S. 218</a></span> (1966);  and again:</p>\n<p>"[I]t can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of the First Amendment] has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office."</p>\n<p><em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/case.html">401 U. S. 265</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/case.html#272">401 U. S. 272</a></span> (1971).  To accept this generalization, one need not agree that the Amendment has its "fullest and most urgent application" only in the political area, for others would think religious freedom is on the same or even a higher plane.  But I doubt that the Court would tolerate for an instant a limitation on contributions to a church or other religious cause; however grave an "evil" Congress thought the limits would cure, limits on religious expenditures would most certainly fall as well.  To limit either contributions or expenditures as to churches would plainly restrict "the free exercise" of religion.  In my view, Congress can no more ration political expression than it can ration religious expression; and limits on political or religious contributions and expenditures effectively curb expression in both areas.  There are many prices we pay for the freedoms secured by the First Amendment; the risk of undue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 424 U. S. 257</a></p><p> influence is one of them, confirming what we have long known:  freedom is hazardous, but some restraints are worse.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The particular verbalization has varied from case to case.  First Amendment analysis defies capture in a single, easy phrase.  The basic point of our inquiry, however expressed, is to determine whether the Government has sought to achieve admittedly important goals by means which demonstrably curtail our liberties to an unnecessary extent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1910 legislation required disclosure of the names of recipients of expenditures in excess of $10.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Ironically, the Court seems to recognize this principle when dealing with the limitations on contributions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">424 U. S. 25</span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The record does not show systematic harassment of the sort involved in <em>NAACP v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html">357 U. S. 449</a></span> (1958).  But uncontradicted evidence was adduced with respect to actual experiences of minor parties indicating a sensitivity on the part of potential contributors to the prospect of disclosure.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> District Court findings of fact, affidavits of Wertheimer (\xef\xbf\xbd 6) and Reed (\xef\xbf\xbd 8), 2B App. 736, 742. This evidence suffices when the governmental interest in putting the spotlight on the sources of support for minor parties or splinter groups is so tenuous.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court notes that 94.9% of the funds raised by congressional candidates in 1974 came in contributions of less than $1,000, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#26">424 U. S. 26</a></span> n. 27, and suggests that the effect of the contribution limitations will be minimal.  This logic ignores the disproportionate influence large contributions may have when they are made early in a campaign; "seed money" can be essential, and the inability to obtain it may effectively end some candidacies before they begin.  Appellants have excerpted from the record data on nine campaigns to which large, initial contributions were critical.  Brief for Appellants 132-138.  Campaigns such as these will be much harder, and perhaps impossible, to mount under the Act.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Whatever the effect of the limitation, it is clearly arbitrary -- Congress has imposed the same ceiling on contributions to a New York or California senatorial campaign that it has put on House races in Alaska or Wyoming.  Both the strength of support conveyed by the gift of $1,000 and the gift\'s potential for corruptly influencing the recipient will vary enormously from place to place.  Seven Senators each spent from $1,000,000 to $1,300,000 in their successful 1974 election campaigns.  A great many congressional candidates spent less than $25,000. 33 Cong. Quarterly 789-790 (1975). The same contribution ceiling would seem to apply to each of these campaigns.  Congress accounted for these tremendous variations when it geared the expenditure limits to voting population; but it imposed a flat ceiling on contributions without focusing on the actual evil attacked or the actual harm the restrictions will work.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that a candidate\'s committee authorizes a celebrity or elder statesman to make a radio or television address on the candidate\'s behalf, for which the speaker himself plans to pay.  As the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#24">424 U. S. 24</a></span> n. 25, the Act defines this activity as a contribution and subjects it to the $1,000 limit on individual contributions and the $5,000 limit on contributions by political committees -- effectively preventing the speech over any substantial radio or television station.  Whether the speech is considered an impermissible "contribution" or an allowable "expenditure" turns not on whether speech by "someone other than the contributor" is involved, but on whether the speech is "authorized" or not. The contribution limitations directly restrict speech by the contributor himself.  Of course, this restraint can be avoided if the speaker makes his address without consulting the candidate or his agents.  Elsewhere, I suggest that the distinction between "independent" and "authorized" political activity is unrealistic and simply cannot be maintained. For present purposes I wish only to emphasize that the Act directly restricts, as a "contribution," what is clearly speech by the "contributor" himself.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court treats the Act\'s provisions limiting a candidate\'s spending from his personal resources as expenditure limits, as indeed the Act characterizes them, and holds them unconstitutional.

In that case, the Court sustained the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, Title III of the Act of Feb. 28, 1925, 43 Stat. 1070, which, among other things, required political committees to keep </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 424 U. S. 258</a></p><p> records and file reports concerning all contributions and expenditures received and made by political committees for the purposes of influencing the election of candidates for federal office.  The Court noted the conclusion of Congress that public disclosure of contributions would tend to prevent the corrupt use of money to influence elections; this, together with the requirement "that the treasurer\'s statement shall include full particulars in respect of expenditures," made it "plain that the statute as a whole is calculated to discourage the making and use of contributions for purposes of corruption."  290 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html#548">290 U.

Congress clearly had the power to further as it did that fundamental goal:</p>\n<p>"The power of Congress to protect the election of President and Vice President from corruption being clear, the choice of means to that end presents a question primarily addressed to the judgment of Congress.  If it can be seen that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/case.html#547">290 U. S. 547</a></span>-548.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this undoubted power of Congress to vindicate the strong public interest in controlling corruption and other undesirable uses of money in connection with election campaigns, the Federal Election Campaign Act substantially broadened the reporting and disclosure requirements that so long have been a part of the federal law.  Congress also concluded that limitations on contributions and expenditures were essential if the aims of the Act were to be achieved fully.  In another major innovation, aimed at insulating candidates from the time-consuming and entangling task of raising huge sums of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 424 U. S. 259</a></p><p> money, provision was made for public financing of political campaigns for federal office.  A Federal Election Commission (FEC) was also created to administer the law.</p>\n<p>The disclosure requirements and the limitations on contributions and expenditures are challenged as invalid abridgments of the right of free speech protected by the First Amendment.  I would reject these challenges.  I agree with the Court\'s conclusion and much of its opinion with respect to sustaining the disclosure provisions.  I am also in agreement with the Court\'s judgment upholding the limitations on contributions.  I dissent, however, from the Court\'s view that the expenditure limitations of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(c) and (e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Concededly, neither the limitations on contributions nor those on expenditures directly or indirectly purport to control the content of political speech by candidates or by their supporters or detractors.  What the Act regulates is giving and spending money, acts that have First Amendment significance not because they are themselves communicative with respect to the qualifications of the candidate, but because money may be used to defray the expenses of speaking or otherwise communicating about the merits or demerits of federal candidates for election.  The act of giving money to political candidates, however, may have illegal or other undesirable consequences:  it may be used to secure the express or tacit understanding that the giver will enjoy political favor if the candidate is elected.  Both Congress and this Court\'s cases have recognized this as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken.</p>\n<p>Since the contribution and expenditure limitations are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech </p><p><a class="page-number" name="260">Page 424 U. S. 260</a></p><p> of particular candidates or of political speech in general, this case depends on whether the nonspeech interests of the Federal Government in regulating the use of money in political campaigns are sufficiently urgent to justify the incidental effects that the limitations visit upon the First Amendment interests of candidates and their supporters.</p>\n<p>Despite its seeming struggle with the standard by which to judge this case, this is essentially the question the Court asks and answers in the affirmative with respect to the limitations on contributions which individuals and political committees are permitted to make to federal candidates.  In the interest of preventing undue influence that large contributors would have or that the public might think they would have, the Court upholds the provision that an individual may not give to a candidate, or spend on his behalf if requested or authorized by the candidate to do so, more than $1,000 in any one election.  This limitation is valid although it imposes a low ceiling on what individuals may deem to be their most effective means of supporting or speaking on behalf of the candidate -- <em>i.e.,</em> financial support given directly to the candidate.  The Court thus accepts the congressional judgment that the evils of unlimited contributions are sufficiently threatening to warrant restriction regardless of the impact of the limits on the contributor\'s opportunity for effective speech and, in turn, on the total volume of the candidate\'s political communications by reason of his inability to accept large sums from those willing to give.</p>\n<p>The congressional judgment, which I would also accept, was that other steps must be taken to counter the corrosive effects of money in federal election campaigns.  One of these steps is \xc2\xa7 608(e), which, aside from those funds that are given to the candidate or spent at his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 424 U. S. 261</a></p><p> request or with his approval or cooperation, limits what a contributor may independently spend in support or denigration of one running for federal office.  Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures also have corruptive potential; but the Court strikes down the provision, strangely enough claiming more insight as to what may improperly influence candidates than is possessed by the majority of Congress that passed this bill and the President who signed it.  Those supporting the bill undeniably included many seasoned professionals who have been deeply involved in elective processes and who have viewed them at close range over many years.</p>\n<p>It would make little sense to me, and apparently made none to Congress, to limit the amounts an individual may give to a candidate or spend with his approval but fail to limit the amounts that could be spent on his behalf.  Yet the Court permits the former while striking down the latter limitation.  No more than $1,000 may be given to a candidate or spent at his request or with his approval or cooperation; but otherwise, apparently, a contributor is to be constitutionally protected in spending unlimited amounts of money in support of his chosen candidate or candidates.</p>\n<p>Let us suppose that each of two brothers spends $1 million on TV spot announcements that he has individually prepared and in which he appears, urging the election of the same named candidate in identical words.  One brother has sought and obtained the approval of the candidate; the other has not.  The former may validly be prosecuted under \xc2\xa7 608(e); under the Court\'s view, the latter may not, even though the candidate could scarcely help knowing about and appreciating the expensive favor.  For constitutional purposes, it is difficult to see the difference between the two situations.  I would take the word of those who know -- that limiting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 424 U. S. 262</a></p><p> independent expenditures is essential to prevent transparent and widespread evasion of the contribution limits.</p>\n<p>In sustaining the contribution limits, the Court recognizes the importance of avoiding public misapprehension about a candidate\'s reliance on large contributions.  It ignores that consideration in invalidating \xc2\xa7 608(e).  In like fashion, it says that Congress was entitled to determine that the criminal provisions against bribery and corruption, together with the disclosure provisions, would not, in themselves, be adequate to combat the evil and that limits on contributions should be provided.  Here, the Court rejects the identical kind of judgment made by Congress as to the need for and utility of expenditure limits.  I would not do so.</p>\n<p>The Court also rejects Congress\' judgment manifested in \xc2\xa7 608(c) that the federal interest in limiting total campaign expenditures by individual candidates justifies the incidental effect on their opportunity for effective political speech.  I disagree both with the Court\'s assessment of the impact on speech and with its narrow view of the values the limitations will serve.</p>\n<p>Proceeding from the maxim that "money talks," the Court finds that the expenditure limitations will seriously curtail political expression by candidates and interfere substantially with their chances for election.  The Court concludes that the Constitution denies Congress the power to limit campaign expenses; federal candidates -- and, I would suppose, state candidates, too -- are to have the constitutional right to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in quest of their own election.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the argument that money is speech and that limiting the flow of money to the speaker violates the First Amendment proves entirely too much.  Compulsory bargaining and the right to strike, both provided for or protected by federal law, inevitably have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 424 U. S. 263</a></p><p> increased the labor costs of those who publish newspapers, which are, in turn, an important factor in the recent disappearance of many daily papers.  Federal and state taxation directly removes from company coffers large amounts of money that might be spent on larger and better newspapers.  The antitrust laws are aimed at preventing monopoly profits and price-fixing, which gouge the consumer.  It is also true that general price controls have from time to time existed, and have been applied to the newspapers or other media.  But it has not been suggested, nor could it be successfully, that these laws, and many others, are invalid because they siphon off or prevent the accumulation of large sums that would otherwise be available for communicative activities.</p>\n<p>In any event, as it should be unnecessary to point out, money is not always equivalent to or used for speech, even in the context of political campaigns.  I accept the reality that communicating with potential voters is the heart of an election campaign, and that widespread communication has become very expensive.  There are, however, many expensive campaign activities that are not themselves communicative or remotely related to speech.  Furthermore, campaigns differ among themselves.  Some seem to spend much less money than others, and yet communicate as much as or more than those supported by enormous bureaucracies with unlimited financing.  The record before us no more supports the conclusion that the communicative efforts of congressional and Presidential candidates will be crippled by the expenditure limitations than it supports the contrary.  The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by the Act, and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns would not seriously suffer.  In this posture </p><p><a class="page-number" name="264">Page 424 U. S. 264</a></p><p> of the case, there is no sound basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations, so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial, which, in my view, they are.</p>\n<p>In the first place, expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption.  The Court upholds the over-all limit of $25,000 on an individual\'s political contributions in a single election year on the ground that it helps reinforce the limits on gifts to a single candidate.  By the same token, the expenditure limit imposed on candidates plays its own role in lessening the chance that the contribution ceiling will be violated.  Without limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will inevitably and endlessly escalate.  Pressure to raise funds will constantly build, and, with it, the temptation to resort in "emergencies" to those sources of large sums, who, history shows, are sufficiently confident of not being caught to risk flouting contribution limits.  Congress would save the candidate from this predicament by establishing a reasonable ceiling on all candidates.  This is a major consideration in favor of the limitation.  It should be added that many successful candidates will also be saved from large, overhanging campaign debts which must be paid off with money raised while holding public office and at a time when they are already preparing or thinking about the next campaign.  The danger to the public interest in such situations is self-evident.</p>\n<p>Besides backing up the contribution provisions, which are aimed at preventing untoward influence on candidates that are elected, expenditure limits have their own potential for preventing the corruption of federal elections themselves.  For many years, the law has required the disclosure of expenditures as well as contributions.  As <em>Burroughs indicates,</em> the corrupt use of money by candidates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 424 U. S. 265</a></p><p> is as much to be feared as the corrosive influence of large contributions.  There are many illegal ways of spending money to influence elections.  One would be blind to history to deny that unlimited money tempts people to spend it on whatever money can buy to influence an election.  On the assumption that financing illegal activities is low on the campaign organization\'s priority list, the expenditure limits could play a substantial role in preventing unethical practices.  There just would not be enough of "that kind of money" to go around.</p>\n<p>I have little doubt in addition that limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate\'s understandable obsession with fundraising, and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising function.  There is nothing objectionable -- indeed, it seems to me a weighty interest in favor of the provision -- in the attempt to insulate the political expression of federal candidates from the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly large sums of money.  I regret that the Court has returned them all to the treadmill.</p>\n<p>It is also important to restore and maintain public confidence in federal elections.  It is critical to obviate or dispel the impression that federal elections are purely and simply a function of money, that federal offices are bought and sold, or that political races are reserved for those who have the facility -- and the stomach -- for doing whatever it takes to bring together those interests, groups, and individuals that can raise or contribute large fortunes in order to prevail at the polls.</p>\n<p>The ceiling on candidate expenditures represents the considered judgment of Congress that elections are to be decided among candidates none of whom has overpowering advantage by reason of a huge campaign war chest.  At least so long as the ceiling placed upon the candidates </p><p><a class="page-number" name="266">Page 424 U. S. 266</a></p><p> is not plainly too low, elections are not to turn on the difference in the amounts of money that candidates have to spend.  This seems an acceptable purpose and the means chosen a common sense way to achieve it.  The Court nevertheless holds that a candidate has a constitutional right to spend unlimited amounts of money, mostly that of other people, in order to be elected.  The holding perhaps is not that federal candidates have the constitutional right to purchase their election, but many will so interpret the Court\'s conclusion in this case.  I cannot join the Court in this respect.</p>\n<p>I also disagree with the Court\'s judgment that \xc2\xa7 608(a), which limits the amount of money that a candidate or his family may spend on his campaign, violates the Constitution.  Although it is true that this provision does not promote any interest in preventing the corruption of candidates, the provision does, nevertheless, serve salutary purposes related to the integrity of federal campaigns.  By limiting the importance of personal wealth, \xc2\xa7 608(a) helps to assure that only individuals with a modicum of support from others will be viable candidates.  This, in turn, would tend to discourage any notion that the outcome of elections is primarily a function of money.  Similarly, \xc2\xa7 608(a) tends to equalize access to the political arena, encouraging the less wealthy, unable to bankroll their own campaigns, to run for political office.</p>\n<p>As with the campaign expenditure limits, Congress was entitled to determine that personal wealth ought to play a less important role in political campaigns than it has in the past.  Nothing in the First Amendment stands in the way of that determination.</p>\n<p>For these reasons I respectfully dissent from the Court\'s answers to certified questions 3(a), 3(d), and 4(a). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="267">Page 424 U. S. 267</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I join the answers in Part IV of the Court\'s opinion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#141">424 U. S. 141</a></span>-142, n. 177, to the questions certified,by the District Court relating to the composition and powers of the FEC, <em>i.e.,</em> questions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(d) (with the qualifications stated <em>infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#282">424 U. S. 282</a></span>-286), 8(e), and 8(f).  I also agree with much of that part of the Court\'s opinion, including the conclusions that these questions are properly before us and ripe for decision, that the FEC\'s past acts are <em>de facto</em> valid, that the Court\'s judgment should be stayed, and that the FEC may function <em>de facto</em> while the stay is in effect.</p>\n<p>The answers to the questions turn on whether the FEC is illegally constituted because its members were not selected in the manner required by Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2, the Appointments Clause.  It is my view that, with one exception, Congress could endow a properly constituted commission with the powers and duties it has given the FEC. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 437c creates an eight-member FEC.  Two members, the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, are <em>ex officio</em> members </p><p><a class="page-number" name="268">Page 424 U. S. 268</a></p><p> without the right to vote or to hold an FEC office. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Of the remaining six, two are appointed by the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate upon the recommendation of the majority and minority leaders of that body; two are similarly appointed by the Speaker of the House; and two are appointed by the President of the United States.  The appointment of each of these six members is subject to confirmation by a majority of both Houses of Congress.  \xc2\xa7 437c(a)(1).  Each member is appointed for a term of years; none can be an elected or appointed officer or employee of any branch of the Government at the time of his appointment.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 437c(a)(2), (3).  The FEC is empowered to elect its own officers, \xc2\xa7 437c(a)(5), and to appoint a staff director and general counsel.  \xc2\xa7 437c(f).  Decisions are by a majority vote.  \xc2\xa7 437c(c).</p>\n<p>It is apparent that none of the members of the FEC is selected in a manner Art. II specifics for the appointment of officers of the United States.  The Appointments Clause provides:</p>\n<p>"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:  but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]"</p>\n<p>Although two of the members of the FEC are initially selected by the President, his nominations are subject to confirmation by both Houses of Congress.  Neither </p><p><a class="page-number" name="269">Page 424 U. S. 269</a></p><p> he, the head of any department, nor the Judiciary has any voice in the selection of the remaining members of the FEC.  The challenge to the FEC, therefore, is that its members are officers of the United States the mode of whose appointment was required to, but did not, conform to the Appointments Clause.  That challenge is well taken.</p>\n<p>The Appointments Clause applies only to officers of the United States whose appointment is not "otherwise provided for" in the Constitution.  Senators and Congressmen are officers of the United States, but the Constitution expressly provides the mode of their selection. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  The Constitution also expressly provides that each House of Congress is to appoint its own officers. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  But it is not contended here that FEC members are officers of either House selected pursuant to these express provisions, if for no other reason, perhaps, than that none of the Commissioners was selected in the manner specified by these provisions -- none of them was finally selected by either House acting alone as Art. I authorizes.</p>\n<p>The appointment power provided in Art. II also applies only to officers, as distinguished from employees, [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] of the United States, but there is no claim the Commissioners are employees of the United States, rather than officers.  That the Commissioners are among those officers of the United States referred to in the Appointments Clause of Art. II is evident from the breadth of their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="270">Page 424 U. S. 270</a></p><p> assigned duties and the nature and importance of their assigned functions.</p>\n<p>The functions and duties of the FEC relate to three different aspects of the election laws:  first, the provisions of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608-617 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which establish major substantive limitations on political contributions and expenditures by individuals, political organizations, and candidates; second, the reporting and disclosure provisions contained in 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 431-437b (1970 ed., Supp. IV), these sections requiring the filing of detailed reports of political contributions and expenditures; and third, the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9001-9042 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) with respect to the public financing of Presidential primary and general election campaigns.  From the "representative examples of [the FEC\'s] various powers" the Court describes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">424 U. S. 109</span>-113, it is plain that the FEC is the primary agency for the enforcement and administration of major parts of the election laws.  It does not replace or control the executive agencies with respect to criminal prosecutions, but, within the wide zone of its authority, the FEC is independent of executive as well as congressional control except insofar as certain of its regulations must be laid before and not be disapproved by Congress.  \xc2\xa7 438(c); 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9009(c), 9039(c) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  With duties and functions such as these, members of the FEC are plainly "officers of the United States" as that term is used in Art. II, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 2.</p>\n<p>It is thus not surprising that the FEC, in defending the legality of its members\' appointments, does not deny that they are "officers of the United States" as that term is used in the Appointments Clause of Art. II. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Instead, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="271">Page 424 U. S. 271</a></p><p> for reasons the Court outlines, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#131">424 U. S. 131</a></span>-132,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#133">424 U. S. 133</a></span>-134, its position appears to be that, even if its members are officers of the United States, Congress may nevertheless appoint a majority of the FEC without participation by the President. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  This position that Congress may itself appoint the members of a body that is to administer a wide-ranging statute will not withstand examination in light of either the purpose and history of the Appointments Clause or of prior cases in this Court.</p>\n<p>The language of the Appointments Clause was not mere inadvertence.  The matter of the appointment of officers of the new Federal Government was repeatedly debated by the Framers, and the final formulation of the Clause arrived at only after the most careful debate and consideration of its place in the over-all design of government.  The appointment power was a major building block fitted into the constitutional structure designed to avoid the accumulation or exercise of arbitrary power by the Federal Government.  The basic approach was that official power should be divided among the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Departments.  The separation of powers principle was implemented by a series of provisions, among which was the knowing decision that Congress was to have no power whatsoever to appoint federal officers, except for the power of each House to appoint its own officers serving in the strictly legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="272">Page 424 U. S. 272</a></p><p> processes and for the confirming power of the Senate alone.</p>\n<p>The decision to give the President the exclusive power to initiate appointments was thoughtful and deliberate.  The Framers were attempting to structure three departments of government so that each would have affirmative powers strong enough to resist the encroachment of the others.  A fundamental tenet was that the same persons should not both legislate and administer the laws. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  From the very outset, provision was made to prohibit members of Congress from holding office in another branch of the Government while also serving in Congress.  There was little if any dispute about this incompatibility provision which survived in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 6, of the Constitution as finally ratified. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  Today, no person may serve in Congress and at the same time be Attorney General, Secretary of State, a member of the judiciary, a United States attorney, or a member of the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Early in the 1787 Convention, it was also proposed that members of Congress be absolutely ineligible during the term for which they were elected, and for a period thereafter, for appointment to any state or federal office. [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  But to meet substantial opposition to so stringent a provision, ineligibility for state office was first eliminated, [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>] and, under the language ultimately adopted, Congressmen </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 424 U. S. 273</a></p><p> were disqualified from being appointed only to those offices which were created, or for which the emoluments were increased, during their term of office. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  Offices not in this category could be filled by Representatives or Senators, but only upon resignation.</p>\n<p>Immediately upon settling the ineligibility provision, the Framers returned to the appointment power which they had several times before debated and postponed for later consideration. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  From the outset, there had been no dispute that the Executive alone should appoint, and not merely nominate, purely executive officers, [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>] but, at one stage, judicial officers were to be selected by the entire Congress. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  This provision was subsequently changed to lodge the power to choose judges in the Senate, [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>] which was later also given the power to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  But following resolution of the dispute over the ineligibility provision, which served both to prevent members of Congress from appointing themselves to federal office and to limit their being appointed to federal office, it was determined that the appointment of all principal officers, whether executive or not, should originate with the President, and that the Senate should have only the power of advice and consent. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]  Inferior officers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="274">Page 424 U. S. 274</a></p><p> could be otherwise appointed, but not by Congress itself. [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>]  This allocation of the appointment power, in which, for the first time, the Executive had the power to initiate appointment to all principal offices and the Senate was empowered to advise and consent to nominations by the Executive, [<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>] was made possible by adoption of the ineligibility provisions, and was formulated as part of the fundamental compromises with respect to the composition of the Senate, the respective roles of the House and Senate, and the placement of the election of the President in the electoral college.</p>\n<p>Under Art. II, as finally adopted, law enforcement authority was not to be lodged in elected legislative officials subject to political pressures.  Neither was the Legislative Branch to have the power to appoint those who were to enforce and administer the law.  Also, the appointment power denied Congress and vested in the President was not limited to purely executive officers, but reached officers performing purely judicial functions, as well as all other officers of the United States.</p>\n<p>I thus find singularly unpersuasive the proposition that, because the FEC is implementing statutory policies with respect to the conduct of elections, which policies Congress has the power to propound, its members may be appointed by Congress.  One might as well argue that the exclusive and plenary power of Congress over interstate commerce authorizes Congress to appoint the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of many other regulatory commissions; that its exclusive power to provide for patents and copyrights would permit the administration of the patent laws to be carried out by a congressional committee; or that the exclusive power of the Federal Government to establish post offices authorizes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="275">Page 424 U. S. 275</a></p><p> Congress itself or the Speaker of the House and the President <em>pro tempore</em> of the Senate to appoint postmasters and to enforce the postal laws.</p>\n<p>Congress clearly has the power to create federal offices and to define the powers and duties of those offices, <em>Myers v.

S. 129</a></span> (1926), but no case in this Court even remotely supports the power of Congress to appoint an officer of the United States aside from those officers each House is authorized by Art. I to appoint to assist in the legislative processes.</p>\n<p>In <em>Myers,</em> a postmaster of the first class was removed by the President prior to the expiration of his statutory four-year term.  Challenging the President\'s power to remove him contrary to the statute, he sued for his salary.  The challenge was rejected here.  The Court said that, under the Constitution, the power to appoint the principal officers of the Executive Branch was an inherent power of the President:</p>\n<p>"[T]he reasonable implication, even in the absence of express words, was that as part of his executive power [the President] should select those who were to act for him under his direction in the execution of the laws."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#117">272 U. S. 117</a></span>.  Further, absent express limitation in the Constitution, the President was to have unrestricted power to remove those administrative officers essential to him in discharging his duties.  These fundamental rules were to extend to those bureau and department officers with power to issue regulations and to discharge duties of a <em>quasi</em>-judicial nature -- those members of "executive tribunals whose decisions after hearing affect interests of individuals."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#135">272 U.

As for inferior officers such as the plaintiff postmaster, the same principles were to govern if Congress chose to place the appointment in the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="276">Page 424 U. S. 276</a></p><p> was the case in <em>Myers.</em>  Under the Appointments Clause, Congress could -- but did not in the <em>Myers</em> case -- permit the appointment of inferior officers by the heads of departments, in which event, the Court said, Congress would have the authority to establish a term of office and limit the reasons for their removal.  But in no circumstance could Congress participate in the removal:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Court never has held, nor reasonably could hold, although it is argued to the contrary on behalf of the appellant, that the excepting clause enables Congress to draw to itself, or to either branch of it, the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.  To do this would be to go beyond the words and implications of that clause and to infringe the constitutional principle of the separation of governmental powers."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/case.html#161">272 U.

S. 602</a></span> (1935), limited the reach of the <em>Myers</em> case.  There, the President attempted to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission prior to the expiration of his statutory term and for reasons not specified in the statute.  The Court ruled that the Presidential removal power vindicated in <em>Myers</em> related solely to "purely executive officers," 295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#628">295 U. S. 628</a></span>, from whom the Court sharply distinguished officers, such as the members of the Federal Trade Commission, who were to be free from political dominance and control, whose duties are "neither political nor executive, but predominantly <em>quasi</em>-judicial and <em>quasi</em>-legislative."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#624">295 U. S. 624</a></span>.  Contrary to the dicta in <em>Myers,</em> such an officer was thought to occupy "no place in the executive department," to exercise "no part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President," 295 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#628">295 U.

The Commissioners were described as being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 424 U. S. 277</a></p><p> in part an administrative body carrying out legislative policies and in part an agency of the Judiciary, <em>ibid.;</em> such a body was intended to be</p>\n<p>"independent of executive authority, <em>except in its selection,</em> and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official or any department of the government."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html#625">295 U. S. 625</a></span>-626.  (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p>The holding in <em>Humphrey\'s Executor</em> was confirmed in <em>Wiener v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/349/case.html">357 U. S. 349</a></span> (1958), but the Court did not question what <em>Humphrey\'s Executor</em> had expressly recognized -- that members of independent agencies are not independent of the Executive with respect to their appointments.  Nor did either <em>Wiener</em> or <em>Humphrey\'s Executor</em> suggest that Congress could not only create the independent agency, specify its duties, and control the grounds for removal of its members, but could also itself appoint or remove them without the participation of the Executive Branch of the Government.  To have so held would have been contrary to the Appointments Clause as the <em>Myers</em> case recognized.</p>\n<p>It is said that, historically, Congress has used its own officers to receive and file the reports of campaign expenditures and contributions as required by law, and that this Court should not interfere with this practice.  But the Act before us creates a separate and independent campaign commission with members, some nominated by the President, who have specified terms of office, are not subject to removal by Congress, and are free from congressional control in their day-to-day functions.  The FEC, it is true, is the designated authority with which candidates and political committees must file reports of contributions and expenditures, as required by the Act.  But the FEC may also make rules and regulations with respect to the disclosure requirements, may investigate reported violations, issue subpoenas, hold its own hearings </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 424 U. S. 278</a></p><p> and institute civil enforcement proceedings in its own name.  Absent a request by the FEC, it would appear that the Attorney General has no role in the civil enforcement of the reporting and disclosure requirements.  The FEC may also issue advisory opinions with respect to the legality of any particular activities so as to protect those persons who in good faith have conducted themselves in reliance on the FEC\'s opinion.  These functions go far beyond mere information gathering, and there is no long history of lodging such enforcement powers in congressional appointees.</p>\n<p>Nor do the FEC\'s functions stop with policing the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Act.  The FEC is given express power to administer, obtain compliance with, and "to formulate general policy" [<a href="#F3/22" name="T3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>] with respect to 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608-617, so much so that the Act expressly provides that "[t]he Commission has primary jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions." [<a href="#F3/23" name="T3/23">Footnote 3/23</a>]  Following its own proceedings, the FEC may request the Attorney General to bring civil enforcement proceedings, a request which the Attorney General must honor. [<a href="#F3/24" name="T3/24">Footnote 3/24</a>]  And good faith conduct taken in accordance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="279">Page 424 U. S. 279</a></p><p> with the FEC\'s advisory opinions as to whether any transaction or activity would violate any of these criminal provisions "shall be presumed to be in compliance with" these sections. [<a href="#F3/25" name="T3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]  \xc2\xa7 437f(b).  Finally, the FEC has the central role in administering and enforcing the provisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="280">Page 424 U. S. 280</a></p><p> of Title 26 contemplating the public financing of political campaigns. [<a href="#F3/26" name="T3/26">Footnote 3/26</a>]</p>\n<p>It is apparent that the FEC is charged with the enforcement of the election laws in major respects.  Indeed, except for the conduct of criminal proceedings, it would appear that the FEC has the entire responsibility for enforcement of the statutes at issue here.  By no stretch of the imagination can its various functions in this respect be considered mere adjuncts to the legislative process or to the powers of Congress to judge the election and qualifications of its own members.</p>\n<p>It is suggested, without accounting for the President\'s role in appointing some of its members, that the FEC would be willing to forgo its civil enforcement powers, and that, absent these functions, it is left with nothing that purely legislative officers may not do.  The difficulty is that the statute invests the FEC not only with the authority, but with the duties that unquestionably make its members officers of the United States, fully as much as the members of other commissions charged with the major responsibility for administering statutes.  What is more, merely forgoing its authority to bring suit would still leave the FEC with the power to issue rules and regulations, its advisory opinion authority, and primary duties to enforce the Act.  Absent notice and hearing by the FEC and a request on its part, it would not appear that the Executive Branch of the Government would have any authority under the statute to institute civil enforcement proceedings with respect to the reporting and disclosure requirements or the relevant provisions of Titles 18 and 26.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the development of the administrative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 424 U. S. 281</a></p><p> agency in response to modern legislative and administrative need has placed severe strain on the separation of powers principle in its pristine formulation.  <em>See Kilbourn v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/168/case.html">103 U. S. 168</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/168/case.html#191">103 U. S. 191</a></span> (1881).  Any notion that the Constitution bans any admixture of powers that might be deemed legislative, executive, and judicial has had to give way.  The independent agency has survived attacks from various directions:  that it exercises invalidly delegated legislative power, <em>Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/381/case.html">310 U. S. 381</a></span> (1940); that it invalidly exercises judicial power, <em>ibid.;</em> and that its functions are so executive in nature that its members must be subject to Presidential control, <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935).  Until now, however, it has not been insisted that the commands of the Appointments Clause must also yield to permit congressional appointments of members of a major agency.  With the Court, I am not convinced that we should create a broad exception to the requirements of that Clause that all officers of the United States be appointed in accordance with its terms.  The provision applies to all officers, however their duties may be classified; and even if some of the FEC\'s functions, such as rulemaking, are purely legislative, I know of no authority for the congressional appointment of its own agents to make binding rules and regulations necessary to or advisable for the administration and enforcement of a major statute where the President has not participated either in the appointment of each of the administrators or in the fashioning of the rules or regulations which they propound.</p>\n<p>I do not dispute the legislative power of Congress coercively to gather and make available for public inspection massive amounts of information relevant to the legislative process.  Its own officers may, as they have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 424 U. S. 282</a></p><p> done for years, receive and file contribution and expenditure reports of candidates and political committees.  Arguably, the Commissioners, although not properly appointed by the President, should at least be able to perform this function.  But the members of the FEC are appointed for definite terms of office, are not removable by the President or by Congress, and, even if their duties were to be severely limited, they would appear to remain Art. II officers.  In any event, the task of gathering and publishing campaign finance information has been one of the specialties of the officers of the respective Houses, and these same officers, under the present law, continue to receive such information, and to act as custodians for the FEC, at least with respect to the Senate and House political campaigns.  They are also instructed to cooperate with the FEC.  \xc2\xa7 438(d).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I join in the Court\'s answers to certified questions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(e) and 8(f), and with the following reservations to question 8(d).</p>\n<p>Question 8(d) asks whether \xc2\xa7 438(c) violates the constitutional rights of one or more of the plaintiffs in that "it empowers the Federal Election Commission to make rules under the F.E.C.A. in the manner specified therein."  Section 438(c) imposes certain preconditions to the effectiveness of "any rule or regulation under this section . . . ," but does not itself authorize the issuance of rules or regulations.  That authorization is to be found in \xc2\xa7 438(a)(10), which includes among the duties of the FEC the task of prescribing "rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c)."  The "subchapter" referred to is the subchapter dealing with federal election campaigns and the reports of contributions and expenditures required to be filed with the FEC. [<a href="#F3/27" name="T3/27">Footnote 3/27</a>]  Subsection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 424 U. S. 283</a></p><p> (c), which is the provision expressly mentioned in question 8(d), requires that any rule or regulation prescribed by the FEC under \xc2\xa7 438 shall be transmitted to the Senate or the House, or to both, as thereafter directed.  After 30 legislative days, [<a href="#F3/28" name="T3/28">Footnote 3/28</a>] the rule or regulation will become effective unless (1) either House has disapproved the rule if it relates to reports by Presidential candidates or their supporting committees; (2) the House has disapproved it if it relates to reports to be filed by House candidates or their committees; or (3) the Senate has disapproved it if the rule relates to reports by Senate candidates or their related committees.</p>\n<p>By expressly referring to subsection (c), question 8(d) appears to focus on the disapproval requirement; but the Court\'s answer is not responsive in these terms.  Rather, the Court expressly disclaims holding that the FEC\'s rules and regulations are invalid because of the requirement that they are subject to disapproval by one or both Houses of Congress.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#140">424 U. S. 140</a></span> n. 176.  As I understand it, the FEC\'s rules and regulations, whether or not issued in compliance with \xc2\xa7 438(c), are invalid because the members of the FEC have not been appointed in accordance with Art. II.  To the extent that this is the basis for the Court\'s answer to the question, I am in agreement.</p>\n<p>If the FEC members had been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate as provided in Art. II, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 424 U. S. 284</a></p><p> nothing in the Constitution would prohibit Congress from empowering the Commission to issue rules and regulations without later participation by, or consent of, the President or Congress with respect to any particular rule or regulation or initially to adjudicate questions of fact in accordance with a proper interpretation of the statute.  <em>Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/381/case.html">310 U. S. 381</a></span> (1940); <em>RFC v. Bankers Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/163/case.html">318 U. S. 163</a></span> (1943); <em>Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/case.html">295 U. S. 602</a></span> (1935).  The President must sign the statute creating the rulemaking authority of the agency or it must have been passed over his veto, and he must have nominated the members of the agency in accordance with Art. II; but agency regulations issued in accordance with the statute are not subject to his veto even though they may be substantive in character and have the force of law.</p>\n<p>I am also of the view that the otherwise valid regulatory power of a properly created independent agency is not rendered constitutionally infirm, as violative of the President\'s veto power, by a statutory provision subjecting agency regulations to disapproval by either House of Congress.  For a bill to become law, it must pass both Houses and be signed by the President or be passed over his veto.  Also, "Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary . . . " is likewise subject to the veto power. [<a href="#F3/29" name="T3/29">Footnote 3/29</a>]  Under \xc2\xa7 438(c), the FEC\'s regulations are subject to disapproval; but, for a regulation to become effective, neither House need approve it, pass it, or take any action at all with respect to it.  The regulation becomes effective by nonaction.  This no more invades the President\'s powers than does a regulation not required to be laid before Congress.  Congressional influence over the substantive content of agency regulation may be enhanced, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 424 U. S. 285</a></p><p> but I would not view the power of either House to disapprove as equivalent to legislation or to an order resolution, or vote requiring the concurrence of both Houses. [<a href="#F3/30" name="T3/30">Footnote 3/30</a>]</p>\n<p>In terms of the substantive content of regulations and the degree of congressional influence over agency lawmaking, I do not suggest that there is no difference between the situation where regulations are subject to disapproval by Congress and the situation where the agency need not run the congressional gauntlet.  But the President\'s veto power, which gives him an important role in the legislative process, was obviously not considered an inherently executive function.  Nor was its principal aim to provide another check against poor legislation.  The major purpose of the veto power appears to have been to shore up the Executive Branch and to provide it with some bargaining and survival power against what the Framers feared would be the overweening power of legislators.  As Hamilton said, the veto power was to provide a defense against the legislative department\'s intrusion on the rights and powers of other departments; without such power, "the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands." [<a href="#F3/31" name="T3/31">Footnote 3/31</a>]</p>\n<p>I would be much more concerned if Congress purported to usurp the functions of law enforcement, to control the outcome of particular adjudications, or to preempt the President\'s appointment power; but, in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 424 U. S. 286</a></p><p> light of history and modern reality, the provision for congressional disapproval of agency regulations does not appear to transgress the constitutional design, at least where the President has agreed to legislation establishing the disapproval procedure or the legislation has been passed over his veto.  It would be considerably different if Congress itself purported to adopt and propound regulations by the action of both Houses.  But here no action of either House is required for the agency rule to go into effect, and the veto power of the President does not appear to be implicated.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>That is, if the FEC were properly constituted, I would answer questions 8(b), 8(C), 8(d) (<em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#282">424 U. S. 282</a></span>-286), and 8(f) in the negative.  With respect to question 8(e), I reserve judgment on the validity of 2 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 456 (1970 ed., Supp. IV) which empowers the FEC to disqualify a candidate for failure to file certain reports.  Of course, to the extent that the Court invalidates the expenditure limitations of the FECA, Part I-C, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#39">424 U.

The FEC argues that</p>\n<p>""there is no showing in this case of a convincing legislative history that would enable us to conclude that <em>shall\' was intended to be the `language of command.\'"" </em></p>\n<p>FEC Brief 62 n. 52, quoting 171 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 244 n.191, 519 F.2d 821, 893 n.191 (1975).  The contention is that the FEC\'s enforcement power is not exclusive, because the Attorney General retains the traditional discretion to decline to institute legal proceedings.  However this may be, the FEC\'s civil enforcement responsibilities are substantial.  Moreover it is authorized under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9010, 9040 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), to appear in and to defend actions brought in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9011, 9041, to review the FEC\'s actions under Chapters 95 and 96 of Title 26, and to appear in district court to seek recovery of amounts repayable to the Treasury under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9007, 9008, 9038.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/25" name="F3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the FEC resists appellants\' attack on its position that it has "no general substantive rulemaking authority with regard to Title 18 spending and contribution limitations" (FEC Brief 49), it agrees "that there is inevitably some interplay between Title 2 and Title 18."  (<em>Id.</em> at 55.)  It seeks to minimize the importance of the interplay by noting that its definitions of what is to be disclosed and reported would not be binding in judicial proceedings to determine whether substantive provisions of the Act had been violated, but would simply be extended a measure of deference as administrative interpretations.  Appellants\' reply is the practical one that, whether the FEC\'s power is substantive or not, persons violating its regulations do so at their peril.  To illustrate the extent to which the FEC\'s regulations implicate the provisions of Title 18, appellants point to the FEC\'s interim guidelines for the New Hampshire and Tennessee special elections, 4 Fed.Reg. 40668, 43660 (1975), and its regulations, rejected by the Senate, providing that funds contributed to and expended from the "office accounts" of Members of Congress were contributions or expenditures "subject to the limitations of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608, 610, 611, 613, 614 and 615."  <em>See</em> notice of proposed rulemaking, <em>id.</em> at 32951.  Unless the FEC\'s regulations are to be given no weight in criminal proceedings, it seems plain that, through those regulations, the FEC will have a significant role in the implementation and enforcement of criminal statutes.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/26" name="F3/26">Footnote 3/26</a>]</p>\n<p>The FEC itself cannot fashion coercive relief by, for example, issuing cease and desist orders.  To obtain such relief, it must apply to the courts itself or through the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/27" name="F3/27">Footnote 3/27</a>]</p>\n<p>The same preconditions are imposed with respect to regulations issued under the public financing provisions of the election laws.  26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9009 and 9039 (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  No such requirement appears to exist with respect to the FEC\'s power to make "policy" with respect to the enforcement of the criminal provisions in Title 18 or with respect to any power it may have to issue rules and regulations dealing with the civil enforcement of those provisions.  <em>See also</em> \xc2\xa7 439a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/28" name="F3/28">Footnote 3/28</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 438(c)(4) defines "legislative day."  <em>See also</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9009(c)(3), 9039(c)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/29" name="F3/29">Footnote 3/29</a>]</p>\n<p>U.S.Const., Art.

JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join in all of the Court\'s opinion except  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#51">424 U. S. </a></span> which deals with 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  That section limits the amount a candidate may spend from his personal funds, or family funds under his control, in connection with his campaigns during any calendar year.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#51">424 U. S. 51</a></span>-52, n. 57.  The Court invalidates \xc2\xa7 608(a) as violative of the candidate\'s First Amendment rights.  "[T]he First Amendment," the Court explains, "simply cannot tolerate \xc2\xa7 608(a)\'s restriction upon the freedom of a candidate to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#54">424 U. S. 54</a></span>.  I disagree.</p>\n<p>To be sure, \xc2\xa7 608(a) affects the candidate\'s exercise of his First Amendment rights.  But, unlike the other expenditure limitations contained in the Act and invalidated by the Court -- the limitation on independent expenditures relative to a clearly identified candidate, \xc2\xa7 608(e), and the limitations on over-all candidate expenditures, \xc2\xa7 608(c) -- the limitations on expenditures by candidates from personal resources contained in \xc2\xa7 608(a) need never prevent the speaker from spending another </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 424 U. S. 287</a></p><p> dollar to communicate his ideas.  Section 608(a) imposes no over-all limit on the amount a candidate can spend; it simply limits the "contribution" a candidate may make to his own campaign.  The candidate remains free to raise an unlimited amount in contributions from others.  So long as the candidate does not contribute to his campaign more than the amount specified in \xc2\xa7 608(a), and so long as he does not accept contributions from others in excess of the limitations imposed by \xc2\xa7 608(b), he is free to spend without limit on behalf of his campaign.</p>\n<p>It is significant, moreover, that the ceilings imposed by \xc2\xa7 608(a) on candidate expenditures from personal resources are substantially higher than the $1,000 limit imposed by \xc2\xa7 608(e) on independent expenditures by noncandidates.  Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates may contribute $50,000 of their own money to their campaigns, Senate candidates $35,000, and most House candidates $25,000.  Those ceilings will not affect most candidates.  But they will admittedly limit the availability of personal funds for some candidates, and the question is whether that limitation is justified.</p>\n<p>The Court views "[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates" as the relevant rationale for \xc2\xa7 608(a), and deems that interest insufficient to justify \xc2\xa7 608(a).  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#54">424 U. S. 54</a></span>.  In my view, the interest is more precisely the interest in promoting the reality and appearance of equal access to the political arena.  Our ballot access decisions serve as a reminder of the importance of the general interest in promoting equal access among potential candidates.  <em>See, e.g., Lubin v. Panish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/case.html">415 U. S. 709</a></span> (1974); <em>Bullock v. Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/134/case.html">405 U. S. 134</a></span> (1972).  While admittedly those cases dealt with barriers to entry different from those we consider here, the barriers to which \xc2\xa7 608(a) is directed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="288">Page 424 U. S. 288</a></p><p> are formidable ones, and the interest in removing them substantial.</p>\n<p>One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign.  It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant "headstart."  Of course, the less wealthy candidate can potentially overcome the disparity in resources through contributions from others.  But ability to generate contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting support, which, in turn, is facilitated by expenditures of substantial personal sums.  Thus, the wealthy candidate\'s immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can never overcome.  And even if the advantage can be overcome, the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not only discourage potential candidates without significant personal wealth from entering the political arena, but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. [<a href="#F4/1" name="T4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The concern that candidacy for public office not become, or appear to become, the exclusive province of the wealthy assumes heightened significance when one considers the impact of \xc2\xa7 608(b), which the Court today upholds.  That provision prohibits contributions from individuals and groups to candidates in excess of $1,000, and contributions from political committees in excess of $5,000.  While the limitations on contributions are neutral in the sense that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="289">Page 424 U. S. 289</a></p><p> all candidates are foreclosed from accepting large contributions, there can be no question that large contributions generally mean more to the candidate without a substantial personal fortune to spend on his campaign.  Large contributions are the less wealthy candidate\'s only hope of countering the wealthy candidate\'s immediate access to substantial sums of money.  With that option removed, the less wealthy candidate is without the means to match the large initial expenditures of money of which the wealthy candidate is capable.  In short, the limitations on contributions put a premium on a candidate\'s personal wealth.</p>\n<p>In view of \xc2\xa7 608(b)\'s limitations on contributions, then, \xc2\xa7 608(a) emerges not simply as a device to reduce the natural advantage of the wealthy candidate, but as a provision providing some symmetry to a regulatory scheme that otherwise enhances the natural advantage of the wealthy. [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  Regardless of whether the goal of equalizing access would justify a legislative limit on personal candidate expenditures standing by itself, I think it clear that that goal justifies \xc2\xa7 608(a)\'s limits when they are considered in conjunction with the remainder of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="290">Page 424 U. S. 290</a></p><p> Act.  I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court\'s invalidation of \xc2\xa7 608(a).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"In the Nation\'s seven largest States in 1970, 11 of the 15 major senatorial candidates were millionaires.  The four who were not millionaires lost their bid for election."</p>\n<p>117 Cong.Rec. 42065 (1971) (remarks of Rep. Macdonald).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/2" name="F4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, \xc2\xa7 608(b)\'s enhancement of the wealthy candidate\'s natural advantage does not require its invalidation.  As the Court demonstrates, \xc2\xa7 608(b) is fully justified by the governmental interest in limiting the reality and appearance of corruption.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#26">424 U. S. 26</a></span>-29.</p>\n<p>In addition to \xc2\xa7 608(a), \xc2\xa7 608(c), which limits over-all candidate expenditures in a campaign, also provides a check on the advantage of the wealthy candidate.  But we today invalidate that section, which, unlike \xc2\xa7 608(a), imposes a flat prohibition on candidate expenditures above a certain level, and which is less tailored to the interest in equalizing access than \xc2\xa7 608(a).  The effect of invalidating both \xc2\xa7 608(c) and \xc2\xa7 608(a) is to enable the wealthy candidate to spend his personal resources without limit, while his less wealthy opponent is forced to make do with whatever amount he can accumulate through relatively small contributions.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I am not persuaded that the Court makes, or indeed is able to make, a principled constitutional distinction between the contribution limitations, on the one hand, and the expenditure limitations, on the other, that are involved here.  I therefore do not join  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#23">424 U. S. </a></span>S. 14|&gt;Part I-A that are consistent with Part I-B.  As to those, I dissent.</p>\n<p>I also dissent, accordingly, from the Court\'s responses to certified questions 3(b), (c), and (h).  I would answer those questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>I do join the remainder of the Court\'s opinion and its answers to the other certified questions.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I concur in Parts I, II, and IV of the Court\'s opinion.  I concur in so much of Part III of the Court\'s opinion as holds that the public funding of the cost of a Presidential election campaign is a permissible exercise of congressional authority under the power to tax and spend granted by Art. I, but dissent from  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#97">424 U. S. </a></span> which holds that certain aspects of the statutory treatment of minor parties and independent candidates are constitutionally valid.  I state as briefly as possible my reasons for so doing.</p>\n<p>The limits imposed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments on governmental action may vary in their stringency depending on the capacity in which the government is acting.  The government as proprietor, <em>Adderley v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/39/case.html">385 U. S. 39</a></span> (1966), is, I believe, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="291">Page 424 U. S. 291</a></p><p> permitted to affect putatively protected interests in a manner in which it might not do if simply proscribing conduct across the board.  Similarly, the government as employer, <em>Pickering v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html">391 U. S. 563</a></span> (1968), and <em>CSC v. Letter Carriers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html">413 U. S. 548</a></span> (1973), may prescribe conditions of employment which might be constitutionally unacceptable if enacted into standards of conduct made applicable to the entire citizenry.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson in <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/250/case.html">343 U. S. 250</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/250/case.html#288">343 U. S. 288</a></span>-295 (1952), and by Mr. Justice Harlan in his dissenting opinion in <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U. S. 476</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html#500">354 U. S. 500</a></span>-503 (1957), I am of the opinion that not all of the strictures which the First Amendment imposes upon Congress are carried over against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, but, rather, that it is only the "general principle" of free speech, <em>Gitlow v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/case.html">268 U. S. 652</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/case.html#672">268 U.

S. 324</a></span>-325 (1937).</p>\n<p>Given this view, cases which deal with state restrictions on First Amendment freedoms are not fungible with those which deal with restrictions imposed by the Federal Government, and cases which deal with the government as employer or proprietor are not fungible with those which deal with the government as a lawmaker enacting criminal statutes applying to the population generally.  The statute before us was enacted by Congress not with the aim of managing the Government\'s property, nor of regulating the conditions of Government employment, but, rather, with a view to the regulation of the citizenry as a whole.  The case for me, then, presents the First Amendment interests of the appellants at their strongest, and the legislative authority of Congress in the position where it is most vulnerable to First Amendment attacks. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 424 U. S. 292</a></p><p></p>\n<p>While this approach undoubtedly differs from some of the underlying assumptions in the opinion of the Court, opinions are written not to explore abstract propositions of law, but to decide concrete cases.  I therefore join in all of the Court\'s opinion except  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#97">424 U. S. </a></span> which sustains, against appellants\' First and Fifth Amendment challenges, the disparities found in the congressional plan for financing general Presidential elections between the two major parties, on the one hand, and minor parties and candidacies, on the other.</p>\n<p>While I am not sure that I agree with the Court\'s comment, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#95">424 U. S. 95</a></span>, that "public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the ballot access regulations dealt with in prior cases," in any case, that is not, under my view, an adequate answer to appellants\' claim.  The electoral laws relating to ballot access which were examined in <em>Lubin v. Panish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/case.html">415 U. S. 709</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/case.html#716">415 U. S. 716</a></span> (1974); <em>American Party of Texas v.

S. 729</a></span>-730 (1974), all arose out of state efforts to regulate minor party candidacies and the actual physical size of the ballot.  If the States are to afford a republican form of government, they must, by definition, provide for general elections and for some standards as to the contents of the official ballots which will be used at those elections.  The decision of the state legislature to enact legislation embodying such regulations is, therefore, not in any sense an optional one; there must be some standards, however few, which prescribe the contents of the official ballot if the popular will is to be translated into a choice among candidates.  Dealing thus by necessity with these issues, the States have strong interests in "limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#96">424 U. S. 96</a></span>.  They have a like interest in discouraging </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 424 U. S. 293</a></p><p> "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism" which might proliferate the number of candidates on a state ballot so as to make it virtually unintelligible to the average voter.  <em>Storer v. Brown, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#736">415 U. S. 736</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Congress, on the other hand, while undoubtedly possessing the legislative authority to undertake the task if it wished, is not obliged to address the question of public financing of Presidential elections at all.  When it chooses to legislate in this area, so much of its action as may arguably impair First Amendment rights lacks the same sort of mandate of necessity as does a State\'s regulation of ballot access.</p>\n<p>Congress, of course, does have an interest in not "funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/case.html#96">424 U. S. 96</a></span>, and may for that purpose legitimately require</p>\n<p>"\'some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support,\' <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/403/431/case.html">Jenness v.

S. 96</a></span>.  But Congress, in this legislation, has done a good deal more than that.  It has enshrined the Republican and Democratic Parties in a permanently preferred position, and has established requirements for funding minor party and independent candidates to which the two major parties are not subject.  Congress would undoubtedly be justified in treating the Presidential candidates of the two major parties differently from minor party or independent Presidential candidates, in view of the long demonstrated public support of the former.  But because of the First Amendment overtones of the appellants\' Fifth Amendment equal protection claim, something more than a merely rational basis for the difference in treatment must be shown, as the Court apparently recognizes.  I find it impossible to subscribe to the Court\'s reasoning that, because no third party has posed a credible threat to the two major parties in Presidential </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 424 U.
