Omaha Indian Tribe, 442 U.S.  653 (1979)</h3><p><b>Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe</b></p><p><b>No. 78-160</b></p><p><b>Argued March 21, 1979</b></p><p><b>Decided June 20, 1979<l=|442 653ast|="" u.s.="">*</l=|442></b></p><p><b>442 U.S. 653</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Pursuant to an 1854 treaty, the reservation of the Omaha Indian Tribe (Tribe) was established in the Territory of Nebraska on the west bank of the Missouri River, with the eastern boundary being fixed as the center of the river\'s main channel.  In 1867, a General Land Office survey established that certain land was included in the reservation, but since then, the river has changed course several times, leaving most of the survey area on the Iowa side of the river, separated from the rest of the reservation.  Residents of Iowa ultimately settled on and improved this land, and these non-Indian owners and their successors in title occupied the land for many years prior to April 2, 1975, when they were dispossessed by the Tribe, with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Three federal actions, consolidated in District Court, were instituted by respondents, the Tribe and the United States as trustee of the reservation lands, against petitioners, including the State of Iowa and several individuals.  Both sides sought to quiet title in their names, respondents arguing that the river\'s movement had been avulsive, and thus did not affect the reservation\'s boundary, whereas petitioners argued that the disputed land had been formed by gradual accretion and belonged to the Iowa riparian owners.  The District Court held that state, rather than federal, law should be the basis of decision; that 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 19 -- which provides that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n all trials about the right of property in which an Indian may be a party on one side, and a white person on the other, the burden of proof shall rest upon the white person, whenever the Indian shall make out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership"</p>\n<p>-- was not applicable, because the Tribe could not make out a <em>prima facie</em> case that it possessed the disputed land in the past without proving its case on the merits; and that, under Nebraska law, the changes in the river had been accretive, and thus the petitioners were the owners of the disputed area.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that federal, rather than state, law was applicable; that the Tribe had made a sufficient showing to invoke </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 442 U. S. 654</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 194; and that, applying the federal common law of accretion and avulsion to the evidence, the evidence was in equipoise, and thus, under \xc2\xa7 194, judgment must be entered for the Tribe.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The Court of Appeals was partially correct in ruling that \xc2\xa7 194 is applicable here; by its terms, \xc2\xa7 194 applies to the private petitioners, but not to petitioner State of Iowa.  In view of the history of \xc2\xa7 194 and its purpose of protecting Indians from claims made by non-Indian squatters on their lands, it applies even when an Indian tribe is the litigant, rather than one or more individual Indians.  But, while Congress was aware that \xc2\xa7 194 would be interpreted to cover artificial entities, such as corporations, as well as individuals, there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended the word "white person" to include any of the States of the Union.  Here, there seems to be no question that the disputed land was once riparian land lying on the west bank of the Missouri River, and was long occupied by the Tribe as part of the reservation set apart for it in consequence of the 1854 treaty, and this was enough to bring \xc2\xa7 194 into play.  In view of the purpose of the statute and its use of the term "presumption" which the "white man" must overcome, \xc2\xa7 194 contemplates the non-Indian\'s shouldering the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of producing evidence once the tribe has made out its <em>prima facie</em> case of prior title or possession.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>At issue here is the ownership of a tract of land on the east bank of the Missouri River in Iowa.  Respondent Omaha </p><p><a class="page-number" name="657">Page 442 U. S. 657</a></p><p> Indian Tribe, supported by the United States as trustee of the Tribe\'s reservation lands, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] claims the tract as part of reservation lands created for it under an 1854 treaty.  Petitioners, including the State of Iowa and several individuals, argue that past movements of the Missouri River washed away part of the reservation and the soil accreted to the Iowa side of the river, vesting title in them as riparian landowners. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Two principal issues are presented.  First, we are faced with novel questions regarding the interpretation and scope </p><p><a class="page-number" name="658">Page 442 U. S. 658</a></p><p> of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 2126, as set forth in 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194, a 145-year-old, but seldom used, statute that provides:</p>\n<p>"In all trials about the right of property in which an Indian may be a party on one side, and a white person on the other, the burden of proof shall rest upon the white person, whenever the Indian shall make out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership."</p>\n<p>Second, we must decide whether federal or state law determines whether the critical changes in the course of the Missouri River in this case were accretive or avulsive.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1854, the Omaha Indian Tribe ceded most of its aboriginal lands by treaty to the United States in exchange for money and assistance to enable the Tribe to cultivate its retained lands.  Treaty of Mar. 16, 1854, 10 Stat. 1043; <em>see United States v. Omaha Indians,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/275/case.html">253 U. S. 275</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/275/case.html#277">253 U. S. 277</a></span>-278 (1920).  The retained lands proved unsatisfactory to the Tribe, and it exercised its option under the treaty to exchange those lands for a tract of 300,000 acres to be designated by the President and acceptable to the Tribe.  The Blackbird Hills area, on the west bank of the Missouri, all of which was then part of the Territory of Nebraska, was selected.  The eastern boundary of the reservation was fixed as the center of the main channel of the Missouri River, the thalweg. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  That land, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 442 U. S. 659</a></p><p> as modified by a subsequent treaty and statutes, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] has remained the home of the Omaha Indian Tribe.</p>\n<p>In 1867, a survey by T. H. Barrett of the General Land Office established that the reservation included a large peninsula jutting east toward the opposite, Iowa, side of the river, around which the river flowed in an oxbow curve known as Blackbird Bend. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Over the next few decades, the river changed course several times, sometimes moving east, sometimes west. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Since 1927, the river has been west of its 1867 position, leaving most of the Barrett survey area on the Iowa side of the river, separated from the rest of the reservation.</p>\n<p>As the area, now on the Iowa side, dried out, Iowa residents settled on, improved, and farmed it.  These non-Indian owners and their successors in title occupied the land for many </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 442 U. S. 660</a></p><p> years prior to April 2, 1975, when they were dispossessed by the Tribe, with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>\n<p>Four lawsuits followed the seizure, three in federal court and one in state court.  The Federal District Court for the Northern District of Iowa consolidated the three federal actions, severed claims to damages and lands outside the Barrett survey area, and issued a temporary injunction that permitted the Tribe to continue possession.  The court then tried the case without a jury.  At trial, the Government and the Tribe argued that the river\'s movement had been avulsive, and therefore the change in location of the river had not affected the boundary of the reservation.  Petitioners argued that the river had gradually eroded the reservation lands on the west bank of the river, and that the disputed land on the east bank, in Iowa, had been formed by gradual accretion and belonged to the east-bank riparian owners. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Both sides sought to quiet title in their names.</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that state, rather than federal, law should be the basis of decision.  <em>United States v. Wilson,</em> 433 F.Supp. 57 (1977).  The court interpreted the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1652, as not requiring the application </p><p><a class="page-number" name="661">Page 442 U. S. 661</a></p><p> of federal law in land disputes, even though the United States and an Indian tribe were claimants, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] unless the Constitution, a treaty, or an Act of Congress specifically supplanted state law.  The court found no indication in those sources that federal law was to govern.  It then went on to conclude that 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194 as not applicable to the case, because it was impossible for the Tribe to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case that it possessed the disputed lands in the past without proving its case on the merits.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 194 had no significance, because it was "inextricably entwined with the merits."  433 F.Supp. at 66. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Applying Nebraska law, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] which places the burden of proof on the party seeking to quiet title, the court concluded that the key changes in the river had been accretive, and that the east-bank riparians, the petitioners, were thus the owners of the disputed area.  433 F.Supp. 67 (1977). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="662">Page 442 U. S. 662</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reversed.  575 F.2d 620 (CA8 1978).  It began by ruling that the District Court should have applied federal, rather than state, law for two distinct reasons.  First, the boundary of the reservation was coincidental with an interstate boundary at the time the river moved.  Therefore, under <em>Oregon ex rel. State Land Board v. Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/363/case.html">429 U. S. 363</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/363/case.html#375">429 U. S. 375</a></span> (1977), and other cases of this Court, the governing law is federal because</p>\n<p>"[t]he rendering of a decision in a private dispute which would \'press back\' an interstate boundary sufficiently implicates the interests of the states to require the application of federal common law."</p>\n<p>575 F.2d at 628.  Second, the Court of Appeals construed our decision in <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html">414 U. S. 661</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html#677">414 U. S. 677</a></span> (1974), as requiring the application of federal law because the Tribe asserted a right to reservation land based directly on the 1854 treaty, and therefore arising under and protected by federal law.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Court had erred by refusing to apply 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194.  Because the Tribe had proved that the 1854 treaty included the land area within the Barrett survey, it had made a sufficient showing of "previous possession or ownership" to invoke the statute and place the burden of proof on petitioners.  Adopting the District Court\'s construction</p>\n<p>"would negate the application of the \xc2\xa7 194 statutory burden upon a pleading that simply recites Indian land had been destroyed by the erosive action of a river."</p>\n<p>575 F.2d at 631.</p>\n<p>Reviewing what it perceived to be the federal common law of accretion, and avulsion and with no more than passing reference to Nebraska law on the issue, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had based its ruling on a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="663">Page 442 U. S. 663</a></p><p> too narrow definition of avulsion. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The court then applied the law to the evidence, and found that the evidence was in equipoise.  Because \xc2\xa7 194 placed the burden of proof on the non-Indians, however, the court ruled that judgment must be entered for the Tribe.</p>\n<p>We granted separate petitions for certiorari filed by the State of Iowa an its Conservation Commission in No. 78-161 and by the individual petitioners in No. 78-160, but limited to the questions whether 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194 is applicable in the circumstances of this litigation, in particular with respect to the State of Iowa, and whether federal or state law governs the substantive aspects of these cases.  439 U.S. 963 (1978). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="664">Page 442 U. S. 664</a></p><p> We are in partial, but serious, disagreement with the Court of Appeals, and vacate its judgment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners challenge on several grounds the Court of Appeals\' construction and application of \xc2\xa7 194 to these cases. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  First, they argue that, by its plain language, the section does not apply when an Indian tribe, rather than one or more individual Indians, is the litigant.  We think the argument is untenable.  The provision first appeared in slightly different form in 1822, Act of May 6, 1822, 3 Stat. 683, as part of an Act amending the 1802 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, Act of Mar. 30, 1802, 2 Stat. 139, which was one of a series of Acts originating in 1790 and designed to regulate trade and other forms of intercourse between the North American Indian tribes and non-Indians. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Because of recurring trespass upon and illegal occupancy of Indian territory, a major purpose of these Acts as they developed was to protect the rights of Indians to their properties.  Among other things, non-Indians were prohibited from settling on tribal properties, and the use of force was authorized to remove persons who violated these restrictions.  The 1822 provision was part of this design, and, with only slight change in wording, it was incorporated in the 1834 consolidation of the various statutes dealing with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="665">Page 442 U. S. 665</a></p><p> Indian affairs. Act of June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729.  Section 22 of that Act is now 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 194, already set out in this opinion.  Although the word "Indian" in the second line of \xc2\xa7 22 of the 1834 Act replaced the word "Indians" in the 1822 provision, there is no indication that any change in meaning was intended; and none should be implied at this late date, particularly in light of 1 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1, which provides that, unless the context indicates otherwise, "words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things."</p>\n<p>Even construed as including the plural, however, it is urged that the word "Indians" does not literally include an Indian tribe, and that it is plain from other provisions of the Act that Congress intended to distinguish between Indian tribes and individual Indians.  But as we see it, this proves too much.  At the time of the enactment of the predecessors of \xc2\xa7 194, Indian land ownership was primarily tribal ownership; aboriginal title, a possessory right, was recognized, and was extinguishable only by agreement with the tribes with the consent of the United States.  <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</em> 414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html#669">414 U. S. 669</a></span>-670.  Typically, this was accomplished by treaty between the United States and the tribe, and typically the land reserved or otherwise set aside was held in trust by the United States for the tribe itself.</p>\n<p>"\'Whatever title the Indians have is in the tribe, and not in the individuals, although held by the tribe for the common use and equal benefit of all the members.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

It is clear enough that, when enacted, Congress intended the 1822 and 1834 provisions to protect Indians from claims made by non-Indian squatters on their lands.  To limit the force of these provisions to lands held by individual Indians would be to drain them of all significance, given the historical fact that, at the time of the enactment, virtually all Indian land was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="666">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  We cannot accept this broad submission.  The word "person" for purposes of statutory construction, unless the context indicates to the contrary, is normally construed to include "corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals."  1 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1.  And in terms of the protective purposes of the Acts of which \xc2\xa7 194 and its predecessors were a part, it would make little sense to construe the provision so that individuals, otherwise subject to its burdens, could escape its reach merely by incorporating and carrying on business as usual.  As we said in <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U.

Particularly is this true where the statute imposes a burden or limitation, as distinguished from conferring a benefit or advantage.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/39/301/case.html">United States v.

There is nevertheless "no hard and fast rule of exclusion," <em>United States v. Cooper Corp., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html#604">312 U. S. 604</a></span>-605; and much depends on the context, the subject matter, legislative history, and executive interpretation.  The legislative history here is uninformative, and executive interpretation is unhelpful with respect to this dormant statute.  But in terms of the purpose of the provision -- that of preventing and providing remedies against non-Indian squatters on Indian lands -- it is doubtful that Congress anticipated such threats from the States themselves or intended to handicap the States so as to offset the likelihood of unfair advantage.  Indeed, the 1834 Act, which included \xc2\xa7 22, the provision identical to the present \xc2\xa7 14, was "intended to apply to the whole Indian country, as defined in the first section."  H.R.Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1834).  Section 1 defined Indian country as being</p>\n<p>"all that part of the United States west of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="668">Page 442 U. S. 668</a></p><p> the Mississippi, and not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana, or the territory of Arkansas, and, also, that part of the United States east of the Mississippi River, and not within any state to which the Indian title has not been extinguished. . . ."</p>\n<p>4 Stat. 729.  Although this definition was discarded in the Revised Statutes, <em>see</em> Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5596, it is apparent that, in adopting \xc2\xa7 22, Congress had in mind only disputes arising in Indian country, disputes that would not arise in or involve any of the States.</p>\n<p>Nor have we discovered anything since its passage or in connection with the definition of Indian country now contained in the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1151, indicating that Congress intended the words "white person" in \xc2\xa7 194 to include any of the original or any of the newly admitted States of the Union.  We hesitate, therefore, to hold that the State of Iowa must necessarily be disadvantaged by \xc2\xa7 194 when litigating title to the property to which it claims ownership, particularly where its opposition is an organized Indian tribe litigating with the help of the United States of America.  It may well be that a State, like other litigants and like the State of Iowa did in this case, will often bear the burden of proof on various issues in litigating the title to real estate.  But \xc2\xa7 194 operates regardless of the circumstances once the Tribe or its champion, the United States, has demonstrated that the Tribe was once in possession of or had title to the area under dispute.</p>\n<p>Petitioners also defend the refusal of the District Court to apply \xc2\xa7 194 on the grounds that a precondition to applying it is proof of prior possession or title in the Indians, and that this involves the merits of the issue on which this case turns -- whether the changes in the river were avulsive or accretive.  We think the Court of Appeals had the better view of the statute in this regard.  Section 194 is triggered once the Tribe makes out a <em>prima facie</em> case of prior possession or title to the particular are under dispute.  The usual way of describing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="669">Page 442 U. S. 669</a></p><p> real property is by identifying an area on the surface of the earth through the use of natural or artificial monuments.  There seems to be no question here that the area within the Barrett survey was once riparian land lying on the west bank of the Missouri River, and was long occupied by the Tribe as part of the reservation set apart for it in consequence of the treaty of 1854.  This was enough, it seems to us, to bring \xc2\xa7 194 into play.  Of course, that would not foreclose the State of Iowa from offering sufficient evidence to prove its own title or from prevailing on any affirmative defenses it may have.</p>\n<p>Petitioners also assert that, even if \xc2\xa7 194 is operative and even if the Tribe has made out its <em>prima facie</em> case, only the burden of going forward with the evidence, and not the burden of persuasion, is shifted to the State.  Therefore they, the petitioners, should prevail if the evidence is in equipoise.  The term "burden of proof" may well be an ambiguous term connoting either the burden of going forward with the evidence, the burden of persuasion, or both.  But in view of the evident purpose of the statute and its use of the term "presumption" which the "white man" must overcome, we are in agreement with the two courts below that \xc2\xa7 194 contemplates the non-Indian\'s shouldering the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of producing evidence once the tribe has made out its <em>prima facie</em> case of prior title or possession.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Oregon ex rel.

S. 517</a></span> (1839) (emphasis added by the <em>Corvallis</em> Court).  The Court\'s conclusion in the particular dispute before it in <em>Corvallis</em> was that state law governed the rights of the riparian owner because there was no claim of an applicable federal right other than the equal-footing origin of the State\'s title.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals held, however, the general rule recognized by <em>Corvallis</em> does not oust federal law in this case.  Here, we are not dealing with land titles merely derived from a federal grant, but with land with respect to which the United States has never yielded title or terminated its interest.  The area within the survey was part of land to which the Omahas had held aboriginal title and which was reserved by the Tribe and designated by the United States as a reservation and the Tribe\'s permanent home.  The United States continues to hold the reservation lands in trust for the Tribe and to recognize the Tribe pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 461 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>In these circumstances, where the Government has never parted with title and its interest in the property continues, the Indians\' right to the property depends on federal law, "wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession."  <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</em> 414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html#677">414 U. S. 677</a></span>.  It is rudimentary that "Indian title is a matter of federal law, and can be extinguished only with federal consent," and that the termination of the protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 442 U. S. 671</a></p><p> that federal law, treaties, and statutes extend to Indian occupancy is "exclusively the province of federal law."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html#670">414 U.

Insofar as the applicable law is concerned, therefore, the claims of the Omahas are "clearly distinguishable from the claims of land grantees for whom the Federal Government has taken no such responsibility."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html#684">414 U.

This is not a case where the United States has patented or otherwise granted lands to private owners in a manner that terminates its interest and subjects the grantees\' incidents of ownership to determination by the applicable state law.  The issue here is whether the Tribe is no longer entitled to possession of an area that in the past was concededly part of the reservation as originally established.  That question, under <em>Oneida,</em> is a matter for the federal law to decide. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Although we have determined that federal law ultimately controls the issue in this case, it is still true that</p>\n<p>"[c]ontroversies . . . </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The Court of Appeals, noting the existence of a body of federal law necessarily developed by this Court in the course of adjudicating boundary disputes between States having their common border on a navigable stream, purported to find in those doctrines the legal standards to apply in deciding whether the changes in the course of the Missouri River involved in this case had been avulsive or accretive in nature.</p>\n<p>The federal law applied in boundary cases, however, does not necessarily furnish the appropriate rules to govern this case.  No dispute between Iowa and Nebraska as to their common border on or near the Missouri River is involved here.  The location of that border on the ground was settled by Compact in 1943 and by further litigation in this Court, <em>Nebraska v. Iowa,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/117/case.html">406 U. S. 117</a></span> (1972).  The federal interest in this respect has thus been satisfied, except to the extent that the Compact itself may bear upon a dispute such as this.  <em>United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., supra,</em> advises that, at this juncture, we should consider whether there is need for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 442 U. S. 673</a></p><p> a nationally uniform body of law to apply in situations comparable to this, whether application of state law would frustrate federal policy or functions, and the impact a federal rule might have on existing relationships under state law.  An application of these factors suggests to us that state law should be borrowed as the federal rule of decision here.</p>\n<p>First, we perceive no need for a uniform national rule to determine whether changes in the course of a river affecting riparian land owned or possessed by the United States or by an Indian tribe have been avulsive or accretive.  For this purpose, we see little reason why federal interests should not be treated under the same rules of property that apply to private persons holding property in the same area by virtue of state, rather than federal, law.  It is true that States may differ among themselves with respect to the rules that will identify and distinguish between avulsions and accretions, but, as long as the applicable standard is applied evenhandedly to particular disputes, we discern no imperative need to develop a general body of federal common law to decide cases such as this, where an interstate boundary is not in dispute.  We should not accept "generalized pleas for uniformity as substitutes for concrete evidence that adopting state law would adversely affect [federal interests]."  <em>United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/715/case.html#730">440 U. S. 730</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, given equitable application of state law, there is little likelihood of injury to federal trust responsibilities or to tribal possessory interests.  On some occasions, Indian tribes may lose some land because of the application of a particular state rule of accretion and avulsion, but it is as likely on other occasions that the tribe will stand to gain.  The same would be the case under a federal rule, including the rule that the Court of Appeals announced in this case.  The United States fears a hostile and unfavorable treatment at the hands of state law, but, as we have said, the legal issues are federal and the federal courts will have jurisdiction to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 442 U. S. 674</a></p><p> hear them.  <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/661/case.html">414 U. S. 661</a></span> (1974).  Adequate means are thus available to insure fair treatment of tribal and federal interests.</p>\n<p>This is also an area in which the States have substantial interest in having their own law resolve controversies such as these.  Private landowners rely on state real property law when purchasing real property, whether riparian land or not.  There is considerable merit in not having the reasonable expectations of these private landowners upset by the vagaries of being located adjacent to or across from Indian reservations or other property in which the United States has a substantial interest.  Borrowing state law will also avoid arriving at one answer to the avulsive-accretion riddle in disputes involving Indians on one side and possibly quite different answers with respect to neighboring land where non-Indians are the disputants.  Indeed, in this case, several hundred acres of land within the Barrett survey are held in fee, and concededly are not Indian property.  These tracts would not be governed by the federal rule announced by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>We have borrowed state law in Indian cases before.  In <em>Board of Comm\'rs v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/343/case.html">308 U. S. 343</a></span> (1939), the question was what law, federal or state, would apply in a claim to recover taxes improperly levied by a political subdivision of a State upon Indians\' trust lands.  The Court observed that,</p>\n<p>"[s]ince the origin of the right to be enforced is the Treaty, plainly whatever rule we fashion is ultimately attributable to the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States, and does not owe its authority to the law-making agencies of Kansas."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/338/case.html#340">308 U. S. 349</a></span>-350.  The Court, nevertheless, elected to adopt state law as the federal rule of decision.  There was no reason in the circumstances of the case for the beneficiaries of federal rights to have a privileged position over other aggrieved taxpayers, and "[t]o respect the law of interest prevailing in Kansas in no wise impinges upon the exemption </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>The importance of attending to state law, once an interstate boundary has been determined, is underlined by <em>Arkansas v. Tennessee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/246/158/case.html">246 U. S. 158</a></span> (1918).  In that case, because the disputed boundary between Arkansas and Tennessee had been determined, the question of title to riparian land and to the river bottom was a matter to be determined by local law:</p>\n<p>"How the land that emerges on either side of an interstate boundary stream shall be disposed of as between public and private ownership is a matter to be determined according to the law of each State, under the familiar doctrine that it is for the States to establish for themselves such rules of property as they deem expedient with respect to the navigable waters within their borders and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 442 U. S. 676</a></p><p> the riparian lands adjacent to them. . . .  But these dispositions are in each case limited by the interstate boundary, and cannot be permitted to press back the boundary line from where otherwise it should be located."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/246/158/case.html#175">246 U. S. 175</a></span>-176.  Likewise, in the present case, the Compact of 1943 settled the location of the interstate boundary, within and without the river; and the question of land ownership within or adjacent to the river is best settled by reference to local law even where Indian trust land, a creature of the federal law, is involved.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The passage quoted above from <em>Arkansas v. Tennessee</em> was quoted with approval in <em>Nebraska v. Iowa,</em> 406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/117/case.html#126">406 U. S. 126</a></span>-127, where the central question was the interpretation of the Interstate Compact determining the location of the entire border between Nebraska and Iowa. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Our opinion in <em>Nebraska v. Iowa</em> is also instructive with respect to which state law, Iowa or Nebraska, the federal court should refer to in determining the federal standard applicable to this case.</p>\n<p>Under \xc2\xa7 2 of the Compact, each State ceded to the other and relinquished jurisdiction over all lands within the Compact boundary of the other State.  Under \xc2\xa7 3, "Titles, mortgages, and other liens" affecting such lands that are "good in" the ceding State "shall be good in" the other State. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 442 U. S. 677</a></p><p> Thus, ceded lands east of the Compact line came under Iowa jurisdiction; but Iowa was obligated to respect title to any ceded land east of the new boundary if that title was "good in" Nebraska.  Accepting the Special Master\'s recommendations in this respect, the Court ruled that one claiming a Nebraska title to land east of the Compact line need show only "good title" under Nebraska law, and need not also prove either the location of the original boundary between the two States or that the land at issue was on the Nebraska side of that original boundary.  The Court further ruled, in agreement with the Special Master, that in litigating with private claimants seeking to prove good Nebraska title to land east of the Compact line, the State of Iowa was disentitled to rely on certain doctrines of Iowa common law bearing on riparian land ownership. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, the District Court ruled that, even though the United States and an Indian tribe, rather than private parties, were plaintiffs, title to the Barrett survey land, which was once in Nebraska but is now unquestionably in Iowa, should be governed by Nebraska law in accordance with the terms of the Compact.  Proceeding to adjudicate the case in accordance with Nebraska law, the District Judge found that the Tribe and the Government, respondents here, had failed to prove that the Blackbird Bend area had been separated from the rest of the reservation by avulsive changes in the Missouri River, and that the defendants, petitioners here, without the aid of any presumption of accretion available under Iowa law, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 442 U. S. 678</a></p><p> if applicable, had instead proved that the river changes had been by accretion.  In the course of arriving at this conclusion, the District Court, relying on Nebraska cases, rejected the Government\'s definition of avulsion, later embraced by the Court of Appeals, as contrary to the common law of Nebraska.  The defendants, petitioners here, having carried the burden of proving their good title to the land at issue, were entitled to a decree quieting title in them.</p>\n<p>Although we have already held that the District Court erred in concluding that determination of titles to reservations lands is not a matter for the federal law, we have also indicated that the federal law should incorporate the applicable state property law to resolve the dispute.  Therefore, it seems to us that the District Court reached the correct result in ruling that, under the construction of the Compact in <em>Nebraska v. Iowa,</em> Nebraska law should be applied in determining whether the changes in the river that moved the Blackbird Bend area from Nebraska to Iowa had been avulsive or accretive.  It should also be noted that the District Court, although wrong in wholly rejecting the applicability of \xc2\xa7 194, concluded as a matter of fact and law that the defendants, petitioners here, had carried the burden of persuasion normally incumbent upon a plaintiff in a quiet title action, and had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the reservation lands had eroded and had accreted to the Iowa shoreline.  Apparently for this reason, the trial judge observed at the end of his memorandum opinion that, were he wrong in refusing to apply \xc2\xa7 194, his findings and conclusions "would not be altered by any different allocation of the burden of persuasion." 433 F.Supp. at 67.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In sum, the Court of Appeals was partially correct in ruling that \xc2\xa7 194 was applicable in this case.  By its terms, \xc2\xa7 194 applies to the private petitioners, but not to petitioner State of Iowa.  We also agree with the Court of Appeals\' conclusion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 442 U. S. 679</a></p><p> that federal law governed the substantive aspects of the dispute, but find it in error for arriving at a federal standard, independent of state law, to determine whether there had been an avulsion or an accretion.  Instead, the court should have incorporated the law of the State that otherwise would have been applicable which, as we have said, is the law of Nebraska.  Of course, because of its view of the controlling law, the Court of Appeals did not consider whether the District Court had correctly interpreted Nebraska law and had properly applied it to the facts of this case.  These tasks are still to be performed, and we vacate the Court of Appeals\' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR JUSTICE POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. 78-161, <em>Iowa et al. v.

Because Nebraska law would not aid the defendants by a presumption of accretion, the Tribe was favored by the application of Nebraska law.  The District Court was also of the view that the federal accretion-avulsion law was not substantially different.

This definition was broader than the Nebraska rule as understood and applied by the District Court, which the Court of Appeals described as follows:</p>\n<p>"an avulsion occurs only where a sudden shift in a channel cuts off land \'so that, after the shift it, remains identifiable as land which existed before the change of the channel and which never became a part of the river bed.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 634, quoting 433 F.Supp. at 73.

But there the United States issued patents granting former reservation lands.  The Court merely held that, absent contrary evidence, when the United States conveyed and completely parted with its territory, even though Indian land, it intended the incidents of the resulting ownership to be determined by state law.  This is no more than the general rule that <em>Oneida</em> recognized.  In the present case, of course, the area at issue was never conveyed away by the United States or by the Tribe. and is claimed by the United States and the Tribe to remain as part of the reservation established as the result of the treaty of 1854.

Nothing seems to us more appropriate than due regard for local institutions and local interests.  We are concerned with the interplay between the rights of Indians under federal guardianship and the local repercussion of those rights.  Congress has not been heedless of the interests of the states in which Indian lands were situated, as reflected by their local laws.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 5 of the General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 389.  With reference to other federal rights, the state law has been absorbed, as it were, as the governing federal rule not because state law was the source of the right, but because recognition of state interests was not deemed inconsistent with federal policy.  <em>See Brown v.

The property dispute here is between Indians, on the one hand, and, on the other, nine individuals, two corporations, and the State of Iowa.  <em>See</em> 575 F.2d 620, 622 (CA8 1978).  The Court holds that "white person" includes an artificial entity, and thus that \xc2\xa7 194 applies in the dispute between the Omahas and the two corporate petitioners.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html#666">442 U. S. 666</a></span>-667.  Contrariwise, the Court holds that "white person" does not include a sovereign State, and thus that \xc2\xa7 194 does not apply in the dispute between the Omahas and petitioner State of Iowa.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html#667">442 U.

The Court could assume, first, that all nine individual petitioners are Caucasians, and hence each literally is a "white person" under \xc2\xa7 194.  There is no evidence in the record, however, as to the race of these individuals.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioners in No. 78160, p. 30; Brief for United States 32 n. 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.  Since the burden of proving the factual predicate for \xc2\xa7 194\'s applicability presumably rests on the Indians who seek to invoke it, the Court, in holding \xc2\xa7 194 applicable to the individual petitioners here, could not properly rely on this first possible assumption.</p>\n<p>The Court could assume, second, that "white person" in \xc2\xa7 194 refers, not to a Caucasian, but to a "non-Indian" individual.  On this assumption, the race of the individual petitioners (so long as they are not Indians) would be irrelevant in determining \xc2\xa7 194\'s applicability.  That this is in fact the assumption the Court makes is suggested by its decision to ignore the adjective "white" in holding each of the corporate petitioners to be a "white person," and by its refusal to follow <em>United States v. Perryman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/235/case.html">100 U. S. 235</a></span> (1880), where it was held that "white person," as used in another section of the Non-Intercourse Act, did not include a Negro.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html#666">442 U.

I would prefer to make this holding explicit.  In my view, any other construction of \xc2\xa7 194 would raise serious constitutional questions.  To construe \xc2\xa7 194 as applicable to disputes between Indians and Caucasians, but not to disputes between Indians and black or oriental individuals, would create an irrational racial classification highly questionable under the Fifth Amendment\'s equal protection guarantee.  To </p><p><a class="page-number" name="681">Page 442 U. S. 681</a></p><p> avoid this result, \xc2\xa7 194\'s reference to a "white person" must be read to mean any "non-Indian" individual or entity, and I so interpret the Court\'s holding today.  To the extent that <em>Perryman</em> is inconsistent with this reading, I must regard that case as overruled <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
