S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  Here, federal contracts provided that two North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body involved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible fraud.  Both the county and the State issued reports identifying potential irregularities in the contracts\xe2\x80\x99 administration.  Subsequently, Wilson filed a <em>qui tam</em> action, alleging, as relevant here, that petitioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials, knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held were \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d reports under the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar.  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal administrative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The reference to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d reports, audits, and investigations in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits.  The language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The FCA\xe2\x80\x99s plain text does not limit \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d to federal sources.  Because that term modifies \xe2\x80\x9creport, hearing, audit, or investigation\xe2\x80\x9d in a provision about \xe2\x80\x9cthe public disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of fraud on the United States, it is most naturally read to describe government agency activities.  But since \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d is not itself modified by \xe2\x80\x9cfederal,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state and local agency activities from its ambit.  The interpretive maxim <em>noscitur a sociis</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Russell Motor Car Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/261/514/index.html">261 U. S. 514</a>, 519\xe2\x80\x94does not support the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s more limited view.  In Category 2, \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d is sandwiched between the federal terms \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO],\xe2\x80\x9d but these items are too few and too disparate to qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ca string of statutory terms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>S.\xc2\xa0D.

S. 368</a>, 371, for <em>noscitur a sociis</em> purposes.  Furthermore, evaluating \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d within the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s larger scheme, the Court observes that Category 2\xe2\x80\x99s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Category 1 (\xe2\x80\x9ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing\xe2\x80\x9d) and Category 3 (\xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d) that are generally understood to include nonfederal sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (\xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d) that is at issue.  Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi-legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legislative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.  The FCA\xe2\x80\x99s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.  And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative.\xe2\x80\x9d  The current \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) was enacted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.  How exactly the statute came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant substantive changes\xe2\x80\x94including the introduction of \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d in Category 2\xe2\x80\x94were inserted without floor debate or other discussion, as \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical\xe2\x80\x9d amendments.

The question here concerns that subset\xe2\x80\x99s precise scope; and on that matter, the record is all but opaque, leaving no \xe2\x80\x9cevident legislative purpose\xe2\x80\x9d to guide resolution of this discrete issue, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bornstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/303/index.html">423 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73729\xe2\x80\x933733, has authorized both the Attorney General and private <em>qui tam</em> relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States.  The Act now contains a provision barring <em>qui tam</em> actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain specified sources.  \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  The question before us is whether the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d reports, audits, and investigations in that provision encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources.  We hold that it does.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suffered extensive flooding.  The Federal Government agreed to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs.  Respondent Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the Graham County Soil and Conservation District, a special-purpose government body that had been delegated partial responsibility for coordinating and performing the remediation effort.  Suspecting possible fraud in connection with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local officials in the summer of 1995.  She also sent a letter to, and had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Graham County officials began an investigation.  An accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified several potential irregularities in the county\xe2\x80\x99s administration of the contracts.  Shortly thereafter, the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying similar problems.  The USDA\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Inspector General eventually issued a third report that contained additional findings. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petitioners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant to the 1995 contracts.  She further alleged that petitioners retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation of those false claims.  Following this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the statute of limitations applicable to Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim, <em>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/409/index.html">545 U. S. 409</a> (2005), the Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as time barred.  424 F.\xc2\xa03d 437 (CA4 2005).  On remand, the District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s <em>qui tam</em> action for lack of jurisdiction.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a\xe2\x80\x93105a.  The court found that Wilson had failed to refute that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report.  <em>Id.,</em> at 95a\xe2\x80\x9398a.  Those reports, the District Court determined, constituted \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative \xe2\x80\xa6 report[s], \xe2\x80\xa6 audit[s], or investigation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court because the reports had been generated by state and local entities.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly <em>federal</em> administrative reports, audits or investigations,\xe2\x80\x9d the Fourth Circuit concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cqualify as public disclosures under the FCA.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 F.\xc2\xa03d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added).  The Circuits having divided over this issue,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  557 U. S. __ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have examined the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s <em>qui tam </em>provisions in several recent opinions.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  At issue in this case is the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s public disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through certain channels.  The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction-stripping disclosures.  Following the example of the Court of Appeals, see 528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 300\xe2\x80\x93301, we have inserted Arabic numerals to identify these categories:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions [1]<font b="1"> in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, [2]<font b="1"> in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3]<font b="1"> from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source<font super="1">[[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]] of the information.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).</font></font></font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1"><font super="1">\n<p align="left">\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d in the second category (Category 2): whether it embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as respondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures made in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Report and the Audit Report, as petitioners allege.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In debating this question, petitioners have relied primarily on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text whereas respondent and the Solicitor General, as her <em>amicus</em>,<em> </em>have relied heavily on considerations of history and policy.  Although there is some overlap among the three types of argument, it is useful to discuss them separately.  We begin with the text.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The term \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmay, in various contexts, bear a range of related meanings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chandler</em> v. <em>Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/74/index.html">398 U. S. 74</a>, 103, n.\xc2\xa08 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to private bodies as well as to governmental bodies.  When used to modify the nouns \xe2\x80\x9creport, hearing, audit, or investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of a statutory provision about \xe2\x80\x9cthe public disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of fraud on the United States, the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cadministration,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n public law, [as] the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d is not itself modified by \xe2\x80\x9cfederal,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the activities of state and local agencies (or their contractors) from its ambit.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to federal administrative reports or investigations.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 301.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is nothing inherently federal about the word \xe2\x80\x98administrative,\xe2\x80\x99 and Congress did not define the term in the FCA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 302.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its application of the interpretive maxim <em>noscitur a sociis</em>.  See <em>id.,</em> at 302\xe2\x80\x93305.  This maxim, literally translated as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it is known by its associates,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1160, counsels lawyers reading statutes that \xe2\x80\x9ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Russell Motor Car Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/261/514/index.html">261 U. S. 514</a>, 519 (1923).  All participants in this litigation acknowledge that the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative Branch of the Federal Government,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and the GAO is a federal agency.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Relying on our opinions in <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co.</em> v. <em>Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/370/index.html">547 U. S. 370</a> (2006), and <em>Beecham</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a> (1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9cthe placement of \xe2\x80\x98administrative\xe2\x80\x99 squarely in the middle of a list of obviously federal sources strongly suggests that \xe2\x80\x98administrative\xe2\x80\x99 should likewise be restricted to <em>federal</em> administrative reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 302.  In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.  Both courts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of this provision intended the word \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched between modifiers which are unquestionably federal in character.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Dunleavy</em> v. <em>County of Delaware</em>, 123 F.\xc2\xa03d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find this use of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> unpersuasive.  A list of three items, each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminating.  Although this list may not be \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely<em> </em>disjunctive,\xe2\x80\x9d 528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 302\xe2\x80\x94it refers to \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d sources, \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A), rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional, <em>or</em> administrative, or [GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d sources\xe2\x80\x94neither is it completely harmonious.  The substantive connection, or fit, between the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGAO\xe2\x80\x9d is not so tight or so self-evident as to demand that we \xe2\x80\x9crob\xe2\x80\x9d any one of them \xe2\x80\x9cof its independent and ordinary significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Sonotone Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/index.html">442 U. S. 330</a>, 338\xe2\x80\x93339 (1979); see also <em>Russell</em>, 261 U. S., at 519 (\xe2\x80\x9cThat a word may be known by the company it keeps is \xe2\x80\xa6 not an invariable rule, for the word may have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association\xe2\x80\x9d).  The adjectives in Category 2 are too few and too disparate to qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ca string of statutory terms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>S. D. Warren Co.</em>, 547 U. S., at 378, or \xe2\x80\x9citems in a list,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Beecham</em>, 511 U. S., at 371, in the sense that we used those phrases in the cited cases.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More important, we need to evaluate \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d within the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar.  Both parties acknowledge, as they must, that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatutory language has meaning only in context,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graham County Soil</em>, 545 U. S., at 415; where they differ is in determining the relevant context.  The Sandwich Theory presupposes that Category 2 is the only piece of \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) that matters.  We agree with petitioners, however, that <em>all</em> of the sources listed in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.  All of these sources drive at the same end: specifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose <em>qui tam </em>actions.  In light of the public disclosure bar\xe2\x80\x99s grammatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarifying to parse the list of sources into three categories.  But it does not follow that we should treat these categories as islands unto themselves.  Courts have a \xe2\x80\x9cduty to construe statutes, not isolated provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U. S. 561</a>, 568 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure bar, the case for limiting \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d to federal sources becomes significantly weaker.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d referenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.  The Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and certain private outlets have a national focus; but no one contends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.  There is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\xe2\x80\x9d listed in Category 1 must be federal hearings.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Of the numerous types of sources that serve a common function in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A), then, only two are distinctly federal in nature, while one (the news media) is distinctly nonfederal in nature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Court of Appeals was correct that the term \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses state and local sources in Category 1, see 528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 303, it becomes even harder to see why the term would not do the same in Category 2.  See <em>Erlenbaugh</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/239/index.html">409 U. S. 239</a>, 243 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context\xe2\x80\x9d).  Respondent and the Solicitor General assert that \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s two references to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d can be distinguished because Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to refer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as rulemaking, oversight, and investigations.  See Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9318; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25\xe2\x80\x9326 (hereinafter Brief for United States).  Yet even if this reading were correct, state and local administrative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a legislative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this inference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by further averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are themselves only federal.  See Brief for Respondent 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Brief for United States 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  No court has ever taken such a view of these sources.  See 528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 303 (citing cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits and stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he courts have easily concluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings\xe2\x80\x9d); Sylvia \xc2\xa711:37, at 643, n.\xc2\xa01 (citing additional cases).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The arguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into Category 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history and policy; they find no support in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General also maintain that the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively federal focus\xe2\x80\x9d of the FCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to encompass nonfederal sources.  Brief for Respondent 10, 18; Brief for United States 13.  The FCA undoubtedly has a federal focus.  But so does every other federal statute.  And as respondent and the Solicitor General elsewhere acknowledge, quite a few aspects of the FCA, including a reference to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings in \xc2\xa73733(<em>l</em>)\n(7)(A)[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) itself, are not just federal.  In any event, the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal focus\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute, as a whole, does not shine light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to certain nonfederal contexts.  It is the fact of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not Federal Government creation or receipt\xe2\x80\x94that is the touchstone of \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last argument grounded in the statutory text: It would be anomalous, they say, for state and local administrative reports to count as public disclosures, when state legislative reports do not.  See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for United States 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Yet neither respondent nor the Solicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners and their <em>amici </em>that, at the time the public disclosure bar was enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legislatures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing federally funded programs.  See Brief for Petitioners 36\xe2\x80\x9339; Brief for National League of Cities et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x9313.  As in the instant case, the Federal Government was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and to provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.  Whether or not state legislative sources <em>should </em>have been included in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, although the term \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d may be sandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal in nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases that have been generally understood to include nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in Category 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of our inquiry.  These textual clues negate the force of the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon, as it was applied by the Court of Appeals.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We are not persuaded that the associates with which \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d keeps company in \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) endow it with an exclusively federal character.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources from which a relator could acquire the information to bring a <em>qui tam</em> action.  In <em>United States ex rel. Marcus</em> v. <em>Hess</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/537/index.html">317 U. S. 537</a> (1943), we upheld the relator\xe2\x80\x99s recovery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a federal criminal indictment\xe2\x80\x94a quintessential \xe2\x80\x9cparasitic\xe2\x80\x9d suit.  <em>Id.,</em> at 545\xe2\x80\x93548; see <em>id.,</em> at 545 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven if, as the government suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing to the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to accomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was passed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress promptly reacted to that decision by amending the statute to preclude <em>qui tam</em> actions \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Dec. 23, 1943, 57 Stat. 609 (codified at 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7232(C) (1946 ed.)).  This amendment erected what came to be known as a Government knowledge bar: \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce the United States learned of a false claim, only the Government could assert its rights under the FCA against the false claimant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel.

In the years that followed the 1943 amendment, the volume and efficacy of <em>qui tam </em>litigation dwindled.  \xe2\x80\x9cSeeking the golden mean between adequate incentives for whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States ex rel.

No. 99\xe2\x80\x93345, p.\xc2\xa02 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present text of \xc2\xa73730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as part of this larger reform.  Congress apparently concluded that a total bar on <em>qui tam</em> actions based on information already in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s possession thwarted a significant number of potentially valuable claims.  Rather than simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, however, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits such as the one in <em>Hess</em>.  How exactly \xc2\xa73730(e)(4) came to strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of considerable uncertainty.  The House and Senate Judiciary Committees each reported bills that contained very different public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in the Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not include the words \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caudit,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d in its version of Category 2, nor did it contain an original source exception.  See S. Rep., at 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (text of proposed \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respondent and her <em>amici</em>\xe2\x80\x99s view, this background counsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d for three separate reasons.  First, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that Congress intended such a result.  Second, a major aim of the 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Government knowledge bar, and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onstruing [\xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A)] as limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers Congress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose \xe2\x80\x98to encourage more private enforcement suits.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324).  Third, whereas federal administrative proceedings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA action based on revelations made therein, the Attorney General is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in state proceedings.  Respondent and her <em>amici </em>further maintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal sources in Category 2, as local governments would then be able to shield themselves from <em>qui tam </em>liability by discretely disclosing evidence of fraud in \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d reports.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but they do not go very far.  As many have observed, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Significant substantive changes\xe2\x80\x94including the introduction of the term we are construing in this case\xe2\x80\x94were inserted without floor debate, as \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical\xe2\x80\x9d amendments.  That the original Senate bill mentioned only congressional and GAO sources in Category 2 is therefore of little moment.  Neither the House nor the Senate Committee Report explained why a federal limitation would be appropriate, and the subsequent addition of \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d sources to this Category might be taken as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full Chambers.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and her <em>amici</em> place particular emphasis on a remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Grassley.  See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for United States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13\xe2\x80\x9314; Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  In a floor statement, Grassley said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98Government\xe2\x80\x99 in the definition of original source is meant to include any Government source of disclosures cited in [the public disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes Congress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or independent agency as well as all other governmental bodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.\xe2\x80\x9d  132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986).  Yet even if a single sentence by a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful weight, Senator Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s remark merely begs the question before us.  His formulation fails to indicate whether the \xe2\x80\x9cother governmental bodies\xe2\x80\x9d may be state or local bodies.  It also turns on a term, \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment\xe2\x80\x9d with a capital \xe2\x80\x9cG,\xe2\x80\x9d that does not appear in the codified version of the public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently revised in numerous respects prior to passage.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record that squarely corroborates respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986 amendments to the Attorney General in 1999.  See 145 Cong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in which Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: \xe2\x80\x9cWe did intend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm, that the disclosure must be in a federal criminal, civil or administrative hearing.  Disclosure in a state proceeding of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam suit\xe2\x80\x9d).  Needless to say, this letter does not<font b="1"> qualify as legislative \xe2\x80\x9chistory,\xe2\x80\x9d given that it was written 13 years after<em> </em>the amendments were enacted.  It is consequently of scant or no value for our purposes.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986 amendments to the FCA \xe2\x80\x9cto strengthen the Government\xe2\x80\x99s hand in fighting false claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cook County</em>, 538 U. S., at 133\xe2\x80\x93134, and \xe2\x80\x9cto encourage more private enforcement suits,\xe2\x80\x9d S. Rep., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  It is equally beyond cavil, however, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to<em> bar</em> a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful.  The question before us concerns the precise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record is all but opaque.  While \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of specific legislative history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bornstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/303/index.html">423 U. S. 303</a>, 310 (1976), there is no \xe2\x80\x9cevident legislative purpose\xe2\x80\x9d to guide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and her <em>amici</em> likewise fail to prove their case that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the statute will lead to results that Congress could not have intended.  Their argument rests on an empirical proposition: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile federal inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to Department of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 22; see also<em> </em>528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 306 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the federal government is unlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a large number of fraudulent claims against the government would go unremedied without the financial incentives offered by the <em>qui tam</em> provisions of the FCA\xe2\x80\x9d).  This proposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.  Numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any given time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn about their findings.  DOJ attorneys may learn about quite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state program financed in part by federal dollars, such as the program at issue in this case.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Just how accessible to the Attorney General a typical state or local source will be, as compared to a federal source, is an open question.  And it is not even the right<em> </em>question.  The statutory touchstone, once again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been \xe2\x80\x9cpublic[ly] disclos[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A), not whether they have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument also gives insufficient weight to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to bar <em>qui tam</em> actions based on disclosures \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the news media.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because there was no such bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a jurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion that the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded intent to increase the availability of <em>qui tam</em> litigation.  And since the \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d include a large number of local newspapers and radio stations, this category likely describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come to the attention of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for respondent and her <em>amici</em>\xe2\x80\x99s concern that local governments will insulate themselves from <em>qui tam </em>liability \xe2\x80\x9cthrough careful, low key \xe2\x80\x98disclosures\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of potential fraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17, this argument rests not just on speculation but indeed on rather strained speculation.  Any such disclosure would not immunize the local government from FCA liability in an action brought by the United States, see <em>Rockwell Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/549/457/index.html">549 U. S. 457</a>, 478 (2007)\xe2\x80\x94and to the contrary it could tip off the Attorney General that such an action might be fruitful.  It seems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view when they assert that, \xe2\x80\x9c[g]iven the fact that the submission of a false claim to the United States subjects a defendant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble damages and attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees, no rational entity would prepare a report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of cutting off <em>qui tam</em> actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 19; see also <em>United States ex rel. Bly-Magee</em> v. <em>Premo</em>, 470 F.\xc2\xa03d 914, 919 (CA9 2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fear [of self-insulating disclosures] is unfounded in general because it is unlikely that an agency trying to cover up its fraud would reveal the requisite \xe2\x80\x98allegations or transactions\xe2\x80\x99 underlying the fraud in a public document\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Congress carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving <em>qui tam </em>plaintiffs: those whistle-blowers who qualify as original sources.

It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a finding for petitioners will \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in effect return us to the unduly restrictive \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d standard\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that prevailed prior to 1986.

I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d in the above-quoted provision refers only to Federal Government sources.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3730(e)(4)(A) sets forth three categories of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that trigger the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional bar: \xe2\x80\x9callegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administrative, or [GAO] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news media.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  (Like the majority, I have inserted Arabic numerals and refer to the three phrases as \xe2\x80\x9ccategories.\xe2\x80\x9d)  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a \xe2\x80\x98fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U.

No party here disputes that \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d refer only to Federal Government sources.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, and nn. 5\xe2\x80\x936.  As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante</em>, at 5,<em> </em>the word \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d is more capacious, potentially reaching not only federal, state, and local government sources but also disclosures by private entities.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cpertain[ing] to administration, especially management, \xe2\x80\xa6 [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or things\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of two \xe2\x80\x9cclearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly federal term\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cvery strong contextual cue about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98administrative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  528 F.\xc2\xa03d 292, 302 (CA4 2008).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The maxim <em>noscitur a sociis</em>, \xe2\x80\xa6 while not an inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gutierrez</em> v. <em>Ada</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/250/index.html">528 U.

Here, the immediate proximity of \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d should be read, like its neighbors, as referring to Federal Government sources.  If Congress had intended to include state or local government administrative materials, it could have said so, for instance by referring generically to \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmental\xe2\x80\x9d sources.  See 528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 304\xe2\x80\x93305.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court applies the logic that underlies the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon in concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to private entities because of the meaning suggested by the slightly more distant neighbors \xe2\x80\x9creport, hearing, audit, or investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 5.  I agree with the majority that \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d in this context does not reach private entities.  But in my view, \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d provide the better textual grounding for that conclusion.  I see no reason why the \xe2\x80\x9cadministrati[on]\xe2\x80\x9d of a private university, for instance, could not issue a \xe2\x80\x9creport,\xe2\x80\x9d order an \xe2\x80\x9caudit\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation,\xe2\x80\x9d or conduct a \xe2\x80\x9chearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor, contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, are private entities\xe2\x80\x94particularly those receiving federal funds or participating in federal programs\xe2\x80\x94incapable of making \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of fraud on the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court nevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 application of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> to interpret the three terms in Category 2, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] list of three items, each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminating.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The three terms in Category 2, the Court concludes, are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo few and too disparate\xe2\x80\x9d to justify invocation of <em>noscitur a sociis</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  We have not previously constrained the canon in this way, and I would not do so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To take just one example, in <em>Jarecki</em> we construed the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98abnormal income,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which the statute defined to include income resulting from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exploration, discovery, or prospecting.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  367 U. S., at 304\xe2\x80\x93305 (quoting \xc2\xa7456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939).  Recognizing that the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[d]iscovery\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cusable in many contexts and with various shades of meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed that it \xe2\x80\x9cgathers meaning from the words around it\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he three words in conjunction \xe2\x80\xa6 all describe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 307.  As a result, and in light of other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion, we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera equipment did not give rise to \xe2\x80\x9cabnormal income\xe2\x80\x9d even if such inventions might otherwise be understood as \xe2\x80\x9cdiscover[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 307\xe2\x80\x93313.  In my view, the three terms in Category 2 are no more \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, than the phrase at issue in <em>Jarecki</em>, particularly given the expansive plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa07.  Here, application of the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>principle readily yields a common feature: The sources at issue are federal in nature, not related to state or local governments or private entities.  See <em>Third Nat. Bank in Nashville</em> v. <em>Impac Limited, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/312/index.html">432 U.

Although the scope of Category 1 is not before us today (and although this Court has never addressed that question), the Court believes that reading Category 2 as limited to Federal Government sources would be inconsistent with decisions of lower courts that have interpreted \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in Category 1 to include both state and federal proceedings.  There is no conflict, however, if both categories are read, as respondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively federal.  See Brief for Respondent 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25\xe2\x80\x9326.  Even reading Category 1 more broadly, however, does not change the exclusively federal nature of \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[GAO],\xe2\x80\x9d which undermines whatever inference might be drawn from taking the statutory terms in strict succession.  Treating the entirety of \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of items gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress made in offsetting each category with commas and prepositions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that modify different nouns.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court also views \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctly nonfederal in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d does not seem particularly illuminating in this context.  As the Court of Appeals observed, although media sources may be national or local in scope, that distinction is not analogous to the difference between federal and state government sources.  528 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 304.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the statutory context and legislative history are also less \xe2\x80\x9copaque,\xe2\x80\x9d cf. <em>ante</em>, at 17, and more supportive of the reading adopted by the Court of Appeals, than the majority today acknowledges.  While the legislative record is concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise caution before giving the statutory text its broadest possible meaning\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, to encompass not only federal, but also state and local, government sources.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three points are particularly salient.  First, prior to the 1986 amendments, the \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d bar unquestionably referred only to information in the possession of the Federal Government.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Even still, the bar was criticized as overly restrictive.  A Senate Report on an initial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, described the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s history and need for legislative reform, noting \xe2\x80\x9cseveral restrictive court interpretations of the act \xe2\x80\xa6 which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93345, p.\xc2\xa04 (1986) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.).  For instance, courts had applied the Government knowledge bar \xe2\x80\x9ceven if the Government makes no effort to investigate or take action after \xe2\x80\xa6 original allegations [a]re received.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 12 (citing <em>United States ex rel. Lapin</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 244 (Haw. 1980)).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, there is more support than the Court recognizes for the proposition that Congress sought in the 1986 amendments to broaden the availability of <em>qui tam</em> relief.  The Senate Report characterized the reform effort as intended to \xe2\x80\x9cenhance the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the Government\xe2\x80\x9d and dwelt at length on the \xe2\x80\x9csevere\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing\xe2\x80\x9d problem of \xe2\x80\x9cfraud in Federal programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 1\xe2\x80\x932; accord, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93660, p.\xc2\xa018 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvidence of fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a steady rise\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Senate Report also articulated a desire to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage any individual knowing of Government fraud to bring that information forward,\xe2\x80\x9d and it identified as \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective enforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the part of Federal enforcement agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 2, 7.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted legislation was replete with provisions encouraging <em>qui tam</em> actions.  By replacing the Government knowledge bar with the current text of \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) and including an exception for \xe2\x80\x9coriginal source[s],\xe2\x80\x9d Congress \xe2\x80\x9callowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cook County</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Chandler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/119/index.html">538 U. S. 119</a>, 133 (2003).  The 1986 amendments also established the right of <em>qui tam </em>relators to continue as a party to a suit after the Government intervenes, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(c)(1) (1988 ed.); increased the percentage of recovery available as an incentive for private suits, \xc2\xa73730(d)(1); and created a cause of action against employers who retaliate against <em>qui tam </em>relators, \xc2\xa73730(h).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, Congress was also concerned in 1986, as in 1943, with guarding against purely opportunistic, \xe2\x80\x9cparasitic\xe2\x80\x9d <em>qui tam </em>relators.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (describing history of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amendments as striking a balance between the \xe2\x80\x9ctwin goals of rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursuing itself, while promoting those which the government is not equipped to bring on its own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co.</em> v. <em>Quinn</em>, 14 F.\xc2\xa03d 645, 651 (CADC 1994).  But evidence that Congress sought to balance two competing goals supports moderation in interpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather than woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest possible extent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the legislative record \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98contains no hint of any intention\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to bar suits based on disclosures from state or local government sources.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20 (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro N.\xc2\xa0Y., Inc.</em> v. <em>Westchester Cty.</em>, 495 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 375, 383 (SDNY 2007)).  Inclusion of state or local government sources would have constituted a significant departure from the Federal Government knowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.  But neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and House Committees nor statements by individual Members of Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation suggest any consideration or debate about expanding the pre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government sources.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although these points do not definitively resolve the question presented today, to my mind they counsel against reading \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) so broadly as to disturb the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve through the 1986 amendments.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision risks such a result.  The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by all appearances <em>more</em> restrictive of <em>qui tam </em>suits than the pre-1986 regime.  Construing \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A) to encompass the thousands of state and local government administrative reports produced each year effectively imputes to the Federal Government knowledge of such sources, whether or not the Government is aware of the information or in a position to act on it.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Solicitor General specifically warns that while information in federal administrative audits or investigations is \xe2\x80\x9creadily available\xe2\x80\x9d to attorneys at the Department of Justice, \xe2\x80\x9cmany state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22.  The Court dismisses this concern as \xe2\x80\x9csheer conjecture,\xe2\x80\x9d postulating that Government lawyers \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in fact learn about \xe2\x80\x9cquite a few\xe2\x80\x9d state or local reports and investigations, particularly in joint state-federal programs.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Perhaps so.

But neither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest possible extent.  Moreover, barring suits based on \xe2\x80\x9cnews media\xe2\x80\x9d disclosures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of existing law.  Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge bar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news media.  In <em>United States ex rel. Thompson </em>v. <em>Hays</em>, 432 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 253, 256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence \xe2\x80\x9cgleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread public attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],\xe2\x80\x9d when the Department of Justice \xe2\x80\x9cfirst obtained information regarding the claims \xe2\x80\xa6 as a result of [a] <em>Washington Post</em> article.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, the court in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burmah Oil Co.</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 43, 46, n.\xc2\xa01 (CA2 1977) <em>(per curiam)</em> characterized the Government knowledge bar as \xe2\x80\x9cdiscourag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of their own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in indictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional investigations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that news media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would naturally\xe2\x80\x94perhaps as a result of the reporting\xe2\x80\x94come to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and thus would already have been covered under existing law.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill that would have barred <em>qui tam</em> actions based on information \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosed during the course of a congressional investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdisseminated by any news media.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

In July, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring actions \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six months of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a congressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or from the news media.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.

The reference to suits in which the Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d in the bill\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional or [GAO]\xe2\x80\x9d reports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or local government reports.  The enacted legislation did differ in several respects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record contains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government sources.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 132 Cong. Rec. 20535\xe2\x80\x9320537 (statement of Sen. Grassley); <em>id.</em>, at 29321\xe2\x80\x9329322 (statements of Reps.

But the requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic\xe2\x80\x9d disclosure countenances notice, both to the public and otherwise.  Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal Government is \xe2\x80\x9con notice\xe2\x80\x9d of alleged fraud before concluding that a particular source is a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure of allegations or transactions\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa73730(e)(4)(A).
