The Airport allocates its air-operations costs--e. <i>g., </i>maintaining runways-to the Airlines and general aviation in proportion to their airfield use, and its terminal maintenance costs to the Airlines and concessions in proportion to each tenant\'s square footage. It charges the Airlines 100% of their allocated costs, but general aviation only 20% of its costs. The concessions\' rates substantially exceed their allocated costs, yielding a sizable surplus that offsets the general aviation shortfall and has swelled the Airport\'s reserve fund by more than $1 million per year. Mter the County Board of Aeronautics unilaterally increased the Airlines\' fees, they challenged the new rates, attacking (1) the Airport\'s failure to allocate any airfield costs to the concessions, (2) the surplus generated by the fee structure, and (3) the Airport\'s failure to charge general aviation 100% of its allocated costs. They alleged that these features made the fees unreasonable and thus unlawful under the Anti-Head Tax Act (AHTA)-which prohibits States and their subdivisions from collecting user fees, 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 1513(a), other than "reasonable rental charges, landing fees, and other service charges from aircraft operators for the use of airport facilities," \xc2\xa7 1513(b)-and under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA). The Airlines also asserted that the Airport\'s treatment of general aviation discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of primarily local traffic, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The District Court held, <i>inter alia, </i>that the Airlines have an implied right of action under the AHTA, but not the AAIA, and no cause of action under the Commerce Clause, and that the challenged fees are not unreasonable under the AHTA.

The Seventh Circuit overlooked the Department of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="357">357</a></p><p>Transportation\'s regulatory authority regarding the federal aviation laws. In view of the Department\'s authority, there is no cause for courts to offer a substitute for conventional public utility regulation. While the AAIA directly addresses the use of airport revenues, the Airlines do not suggest that the Airport has misused the funds in violation of that Act and did not seek review of the lower courts\' ruling that they had no AAIA cause of action. Finally, the record in this case does not support the Airlines\' argument that the lower general aviation fees discriminate against interstate commerce and travel. There is no proof that the large and diverse general aviation population served by the Airport travels typically intrastate and seldom ventures beyond Michigan\'s borders. Pp. 369-373.</p><p>3. The fees do not violate the "dormant" Commerce Clause. Even if the AHTA\'s express permission for States\' imposition of reasonable fees were insufficiently clear to rule out dormant Commerce Clause analysis, the Court has already found the challenged fees reasonable under the AHTA using a standard taken directly from the Court\'s dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

Petitioners are seven commercial airlines serving the Airport (the Airlines).</p><p>The Airport collects rent and fees from three groups of users: (1) commercial airlines, including petitioners; (2) "general aviation," i. <i>e., </i>corporate and privately owned aircraft not used for commercial, passenger, cargo, or military service; and (3) nonaeronautical concessionaires, including car rental agencies, the parking lot, restaurants, gift shops, "rent-a-cart" facilities, and other small vendors. Since 1968, the Airport has allocated its costs and set charges to aircraft operators pursuant to a "cost of service" accounting system known as the "Buckley methodology." 1 This system is designed to charge the Airlines only for the cost of providing the particular facilities and services they use.2</p><p>Under its accounting system, the Airport first determines the costs of operating the airfield and the passenger terminal, and allocates these costs among the users of the facilities. Costs associated with airfield operations <i>(e. </i>g., maintaining the runways and navigational facilities) are allocated to the Airlines and general aviation in proportion to their use of the airfield. No portion of these costs is allocated to the concessions. Costs associated with maintaining the airport terminal are allocated among the terminal tenantsthe Airlines and the concessions-in proportion to each tenant\'s square footage.3</p><p>The Airport then establishes fees and rates for each user group. It charges the Airlines 100% of the costs allocated to them, in the form of aircraft landing and parking fees (for use of the airfield), and rent (for the terminal space the Air-</p><p>1 See James C.

The Airport recovers from that user group a per gallon fuel flowage fee for local aircraft and a landing fee for aircraft based elsewhere. These fees account for only 20% of the airfield costs allocated to general aviation.</p><p>In relation to costs, the Airport thus "undercharges" general aviation. At the same time, measured by allocated costs, the Airport vastly "overcharges" the concessions. The Airlines pay a cost-based per square foot rate for their terminal space. The concessions, however, pay market rates for their space.5 Market rates substantially exceed the concessions\' allocated costs and yield a sizable surplus.6 The surplus offsets the general aviation shortfall of approximately $525,000 per year, and has swelled the Airport\'s reserve fund by more than $1 million per year.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>U sing the "Buckley methodology" just described, the Airlines and the Airport periodically negotiated and agreed upon fees to be charged through December 31, 1986. Following a new rate study made in 1986, the Airport proposed increased fees beginning January 1, 1987. App. 193 (Plaintiffs\' Exh. 6). The Airlines objected to the higher fees and failed to reach an agreement with the Airport. Ultimately, the County Board of Aeronautics adopted an ordinance unilaterally increasing the fees.7 On the effective date of</p><p>4 The Airlines are also charged for the cost of providing "crash, fire, and rescue" services, and amortization fees for assets acquired by the Airport. 5 Most concessions pay 10% of their gross receipts as rent for space.</p><p>6 For example, the Airport\'s annual net revenues from 1987 to 1989 ranged from approximately $1.6 million to $1.9 million.

The ordinance also decreased aircraft parking fees by $.12 per thousand pounds. 738 F.

The Airlines attacked (1) the Airport\'s failure to allocate to the concessions a portion of the airfield costs, (2) the surplus generated by the Airport\'s fee structure, and (3) the Airport\'s failure to charge general aviation 100% of its allocated airfield costs. These features, the Airlines alleged, made the fees imposed on them unreasonable and thus unlawful under the AHTA, as added, 87 Stat. 90, and as amended, 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 1513, and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA), 96 Stat. 686, as amended, 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2210. The Airlines also asserted that the Airport\'s treatment of general aviation discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of primarily local traffic, in violation of the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3.</p><p>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p><p>In the first of three opinions, the District Court denied the motions, holding that the Airport\'s cost methodology is not <i>per se </i>unreasonable. App. to Pet. for Cert. 57. In its second opinion, the District Court held that the Airlines have an implied right of action to challenge the fees under the AHTA but not under the AAIA, and that the Airlines have no cause of action under the Commerce Clause. <i>Id., </i>at 4246. Following a bench trial, the District Court issued its third and final opinion, concluding that the challenged fees are not unreasonable under the AHTA. 738 F. Supp. 1112 (WD Mich. 1990).</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s judgment in principal part. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/955/1054/">955 F.2d 1054</a> (1992). In accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the AHTA impliedly confers a private right of action on the Airlines, but the AAIA does not. <i>Id., </i>at 1058. On the merits, the Court of Appeals (1) upheld as reasonable under the AHTA the bulk of the charges that the Airport imposes on the Airlines, and (2) rejected the Air-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="362">362</a></p><p>lines\' dormant Commerce Clause claim on the ground that the AHTA regulates the area. <i>Id., </i>at 1060-1064.</p><p>On one matter, however, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s judgment and remanded the case. The District Court had upheld as reasonable under the AHTA the Airport\'s decision to allocate to the Airlines 100% of the costs of providing "crash, fire, and rescue" (CFR) services. 738 F. Supp., at 1119. Emphasizing that the CFR facilities service all aircraft, not just the Airlines, the Court of Appeals held that the Airport must allocate CFR costs between the Airlines and general aviation. 955 F. 2d, at 1062-1063, 1064.</p><p>Petitioning for this Court\'s review, the Airlines challenged the Court of Appeals\' adverse rulings on the AHTA and Commerce Clause issues. The Airport did not crosspetition for review of the Sixth Circuit\'s judgment to the extent that it favored the Airlines; specifically, the Airport did not petition for review of the remand to the District Court for allocation of the costs of CFR services between the Airlines and general aviation. We granted certiorari, 508 U. S. 959 (1993), to resolve a conflict between the decision under review and a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, <i>Indianapolis Airport Authority </i>v. <i>American Airlines, Inc., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/733/1262/">733 F.2d 1262</a> (1984), which declared key parts of a similar fee structure unreasonable under the AHTA.</p><p align="center">\nII A</p><p>In Evansville- Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v.</p><p><i>Delta Airlines, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/707/case.html">405 U. S. 707</a> (1972), this Court held that the Commerce Clause does not prohibit States or municipalities from charging commercial airlines a "head tax" on passengers boarding flights at airports within the jurisdiction, to defray the costs of airport construction and maintenance. We stated in <i>Evansville: </i>"At least so long as the toll is based</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="363">363</a></p><p>on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use, ... and is neither discriminatory against interstate commerce nor excessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred, it will pass constitutional muster, even though some other formula might reflect more exactly the relative use of the state facilities by individual users." <i>Id., </i>at 716-717.</p><p>Concerned that our decision in <i>Evansville </i>might prompt a proliferation of local taxes burdensome to interstate air transportation, Congress enacted the AHTA. See <i>Aloha Airlines, Inc. </i>v. <i>Director of Taxation of Haw., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/7/case.html">464 U. S. 7</a>, 9-10 (1983) (summarizing history of AHTA\'s enactment); S. Rep.

S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 1513.</p></blockquote><p>Primarily, the Airlines urge that the Airport\'s fees overcharge them in violation of the AHTA. Before reaching that issue, however, we face a threshold question. The United States as <i>amicus curiae </i>and, less strenuously, the Airport, urge that the Airlines have no right to enforce the AHTA through a private action commenced in a federal court of first instance. Instead, they maintain, complaints under the AHTA must be pursued initially in administrative proceedings before the Secretary of Transportation, subject to judicial review in the courts of appeals.</p><p>The threshold question is substantial: If Congress intended no right of immediate access to a federal court under the AHTA, then the Airlines\' AHTA claim should have been dismissed, not adjudicated on the merits as it was, indeed in part favorably to the Airlines. However, the Airport filed no cross-petition for certiorari seeking to upset the judgment to the extent that it rejected the Airport\'s CFR cost allocation (100% to the Airlines) as inconsonant with the AHTA. For that reason, we decline to resolve the private right of action question in this case.</p><p>A prevailing party need not cross-petition to defend a judgment on any ground properly raised below, so long as that party seeks to preserve, and not to change, the judgment. See, <i>e. g., Thigpen </i>v. <i>Roberts, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/27/case.html">468 U. S. 27</a>, 29-30 (1984).

Unlike the property and income taxes listed in the first clause of \xc2\xa7 1513(b), the airport user fees listed in \xc2\xa7 1513(b)\'s second clause are <i>not </i>described as taxes "other than those enumerated in subsection (a)." The statute, in sum, is hardly ambiguous on this matter: User fees are covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a), but may be saved by \xc2\xa7 1513(b).</p><p>10 The reasonableness of the Airport\'s rates might have been referred, prior to any court\'s consideration, to the Department of Transportation under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.

See 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 1354(a). The Act provides a mechanism for administrative adjudication, subject to judicial review in the courts of appeals, of alleged violations. See \xc2\xa7 1482(a) ("[a]ny person may file with the Secretary of Transportation ... a complaint in writing with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any person in contravention of any provisions of [the Act], or of any requirement established pursuant thereto"); \xc2\xa7 1486 (judicial review provision). The Secretary has established procedures for adjudicating such complaints through the Federal Aviation Administration, see 14 CFR pt. 13 (1993), and the FAA has entertained challenges to the reasonableness of airport landing fees under the AHTA.

Although Congress enacted the AHTA because it found unsatisfactory the end result of our Commerce Clause analysis in <i>Evansville-the </i>validation of "head" taxes-Congress specifically permitted, through \xc2\xa7 1513(b)\'s saving clause, "reasonable rental charges, landing fees, and other services charges." 13 The formulation in <i>Evansville </i>has been used to determine "reasonableness" in related contexts. See, <i>e. g., American Trucking Assns., Inc. </i>v. <i>Scheiner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/266/case.html">483 U.

Section 1513(a)\'s prohibition is written broadly, whereas \xc2\xa7 1513(b) is narrow, saving only "reasonable rental charges, landing fees, and other service charges." A per passenger service charge would be an impermissible "head charge" under \xc2\xa7 1513(a), and does not fit into any of the three categories saved by \xc2\xa7 1513(b). The user fees challenged here, by contrast, are "rental charges, landing fees, and other service charges," \xc2\xa7 1513(b), that would be prohibited as "fee[s]" or "other charge[s]" under \xc2\xa7 1513(a), unless they are "reasonable." See <i>supra, </i>at 365-366.</p><p>14 It remains open to the Secretary, utilizing his Department\'s capacity to comprehend the details of airport operations across the country, and the economics of the air transportation industry, to apply some other formula (including one that entails more rigorous scrutiny) for determining whether fees are "reasonable" within the meaning of the AHTA; his exposition will merit judicial approbation so long as it represents "a permissible construction of the statute." <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A.

We consider each contention in turn.</p><p align="center">\n1</p><p>As noted above, the Airport allocates its air-operations costs between the Airlines and general aviation; the concessions in fact supply the lion\'s share of the Airport\'s revenues, see <i>supra, </i>at 360, but are allocated none of these costs. The Airlines contend that the concessions benefit substantially, albeit indirectly, from air operations, because those operations generate the concessions\' customer flow. Therefore, the Airlines urge, the Airport\'s failure to allocate to the concessions any of the airfield-associated costs violates <i>Evansville\'s </i>requirement that user fees be "based on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use." 405 U. S., at 716-717. The cost reallocation sought by the Airlines would not change the market-based rent paid by the concessions, see <i>supra, </i>at 360, but it would lower the charges imposed on the Airlines.</p><p>We see no obvious conflict with <i>Evansville </i>in the Airport\'s allocation of the costs of air operations to the Airlines and general aviation, but not to the concessions. Only the Airlines and general aviation actually use the runways and navigational facilities of the Airport; the concessions use only the terminal facilities. The Airport\'s decision to allocate costs according to a formula that accounts for this distinction appears to "reflect a fair, if imperfect, approximation of the use of facilities for whose benefit they are imposed." 405 U.

The AHTA, however, does not authorize judicial inquiry focused on the amount of the Airport\'s surplus. The statute requires only that an airport\'s fees not "be excessive in relation to costs incurred by the taxing authorities" for benefits conferred on the user. <i>Evansville, supra, </i>at 719. As we have explained, the Airlines are charged only for the costs of benefits they receive. The Airport\'s surplus is generated from fees charged to concessions, and the amounts of those fees are not at issue. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, \xc2\xa7 1513(b) applies only to fees charged to "aircraft operators." 955 F. 2d, at 1060.</p><p>The Airlines urge us to consider the effect of the concession revenues when deciding whether the fees charged the Airlines are reasonable, pointing to the Seventh Circuit\'s analysis in <i>Indianapolis Airport </i>v. <i>American Airlines, Inc., </i>733 F. 2d, at 1268 (invalidating the Indianapolis Airport\'s fee structure on the ground, <i>inter alia, </i>that the Airport\'s generation of a surplus from the concession fees indirectly raised the costs of air travel). The Seventh Circuit, however, overlooked a key factor. It reasoned explicitly from the incorrect premise that "[n]o agency has regulatory authority over the rate practices of the Indianapolis Airport Authority." <i>Ibid. </i>The Seventh Circuit panel believed that "the duty of regulation [fell] to the courts in the enforcement of the state and federal statutes forbidding unreasonable rates." <i>Ibid. </i>That court thought it necessary to "imagine [itself] in the role of a regulatory agency." <i>Ibid. </i>In contrast, our opinion in this case emphasizes that the Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to enforce the federal aviation laws, including the AHTA and the AAIA, see <i>supra, </i>at 366367, and n. 11, so there is no cause for courts to offer a substitute for "conventional public utility regulation," 733 F. 2d, at 1268.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="372">372</a></p><p>We resist inferring a limit on airport surpluses from the AHTA for a further reason. That measure does not mention surplus accumulation, but another statute, the AAIA, directly addresses the use of airport revenues. The AAIA requires that <i>"all </i>revenues generated by the airport ... be expended for the capital or operating costs of the airport .... " 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2210(a)(12) (emphasis supplied). The Airlines do not suggest that the Airport is using its surplus for any purpose other than Airport-related expenses, nor did they seek review of the lower courts\' holding that they had no right of action under the AAIA. 955 F. 2d, at 1058-1059. For these reasons, even if the AAIA is read to impose a limit on the accumulation of surplus revenues, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae 26-27, </i>the question whether the Airport\'s surpluses are excessive is not properly before us.</p><p align="center">\n3</p><p>Finally, the Airlines contend that the Airport\'s fees discriminate against them in favor of general aviation, in violation of <i>Evansville\'s </i>instruction that airport tolls be nondiscriminatory regarding interstate commerce and travel. As earlier recounted, see <i>supra, </i>at 359-360, the Airlines pay 100% of their allocated costs while general aviation users are assessed fees covering only 20% of their allocated costs.</p><p>We need not consider whether the Airlines would have a compelling point had they established that general aviation is properly categorized as intrastate commerce. Cf., <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hunt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/334/case.html">504 U.

S., at 268-269 (invalidating state highway use taxes because they discriminated against interstate motor carriers). The record in this case, it suffices to say, does not support the Airlines\' argument.

The Airlines have asserted that <i>Evansville\'s </i>standard governs AHTA reasonableness. Thus, under their own theory, they had to demonstrate the equivalent of a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause-i. <i>e., </i>discrimination against interstate commerce-in order to prevail at the AHTA trial. The Airlines\' belated suggestion-which contradicts their endorsement of <i>Evansville, </i>see Brief for Petitioners 22-23-that discrimination in favor of intrastate commerce is relevant under the Commerce Clause, but not under the AHTA, is unimpressive. The AHTA was a direct response to <i>Evansville; </i>Congress\' principal concern in enacting the measure was to proscribe fees that unduly burden interstate commerce. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>S.

Section 1513(b), however, states that "nothing in [the Act]" prohibits the imposition of "taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a)," including, among other things, property and net income taxes, and that the Act does not prohibit "reasonable rental charges, landing fees, and other service charges" collected from "aircraft operators for the use of airport facilities.

The mere fact that the Act is not strictly limited to head taxes, which were the Act\'s primary target, <i>id., </i>at 13, but also encompasses taxes on gross receipts from the sale of air trans-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="376">376</a></p><p>portation, in no way suggests that the Act should be read to encompass all airport "user fees."</p><p>To be sure, the Act\'s apparently broad ban on any fees, taxes, or charges imposed "directly or <i>indirectly, </i>on persons traveling in air commerce," etc., superficially supports the Court\'s interpretation. Any cost an airline bears is in some sense an "indirect" charge "on persons traveling in air commerce," because the airline ultimately will pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher ticket prices. But if \xc2\xa7 1513(a) covers all charges indirectly imposed on air travelers, as the Court apparently believes, see <i>ante, </i>at 365, it should logically encompass all taxes imposed on airlines as well, including property taxes, net income taxes, franchise taxes, and sales and use taxes on the sale of goods and services. Yet \xc2\xa7 1513(b) instructs that such taxes are not covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a)-that they are "taxes <i>other than those enumerated in subsection (a)." </i>(Emphasis added.) Significantly, \xc2\xa7 1513(b) is not phrased as an exemption for taxes otherwise within \xc2\xa7 1513(a)\'s prohibition, but rather as a clarification of the reach of \xc2\xa7 1513(a). It makes clear that the language of \xc2\xa7 1513(a) defining the prohibition does not extend by its own force to the taxes enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1513(b). Under the Court\'s broad construction of \xc2\xa7 1513(a)\'s "directly or indirectly" language, however, the two provisions would appear to be in conflict.</p><p>Recognizing the significance of \xc2\xa7 1513(b)\'s treatment of taxes, the Court implicitly acknowledges that \xc2\xa7 1513(a) does not cover the taxes listed in \xc2\xa7 1513(b). <i>Ante, </i>at 366, n. 9. But the Court can only accomplish this reading by assuming that \xc2\xa7 1513(b) treats the "rental charges, landing fees, and other service charges ... for the use of airport facilities" listed in that subsection differently from the enumerated taxes. In this understanding, while as to taxes \xc2\xa7 1513(b) merely clarifies the scope of \xc2\xa7 1513(a), as to fees it serves the altogether different function of providing an exemption from \xc2\xa7 1513(a)\'s prohibition. The Court supports this reading on</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="377">377</a></p><p>the ground that \xc2\xa7 1513(b) does not explicitly describe the fees as distinct from ("other than") the fees prohibited in \xc2\xa7 1513(a). That construction requires a rather unlikely reading of \xc2\xa7 1513(a), however, because it means that the same language defining the scope of the prohibition in that section inexplicably would have one meaning when applied to fees, and quite a different (and more limited) meaning when applied to taxes. None of the taxes listed in \xc2\xa7 1513(b), although borne indirectly by airline passengers, would constitute a "tax, fee, ... or other charge, [levied] directly or indirectly, on persons traveling in air commerce," etc. But a user fee charged to an airline, <i>because </i>it is borne indirectly by airline passengers, would constitute such a "tax, fee, ... or other charge .... " Thus, the prohibition in \xc2\xa7 1513(a) would not extend to, for example, property taxes, because they are not imposed on one of the bases listed in \xc2\xa7 1513(a), but would extend to other fees or charges, regardless of the basis upon which they are imposed.</p><p>Adherence to the plain language of \xc2\xa7 1513(a) avoids these problems. In my view, when the statute prohibits a tax or charge "on persons traveling in air commerce," "on the carriage of" such persons, "on the sale of air transportation," or "on the gross receipts derived therefrom," it defines the prohibition in terms of the prohibited <i>basis </i>of the tax or charge. That is, \xc2\xa7 1513(a) prohibits the levy or collection of a tax or fee "on" certain subjects. A head tax, for example, is a charge "on persons traveling in air commerce" in that it is imposed on a per passenger basis. A landing fee, by contrast, is not-rather, it is a charge on an aircraft\'s landing at an airport, without regard to the number of passengers it carries.1</p><p>10f course, as the Court notes, <i>ante, </i>at 366, n. 9, user fees such as landing fees are not <i>per se </i>excluded from the Act. An airport could not, for example, simply replace a head tax, which is clearly forbidden by the Act, with a "landing fee" calculated according to the number of passengers on an airplane. Such a thinly disguised substitute for a head tax no doubt</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="378">378</a></p><p>Section 1513(b) confirms that \xc2\xa7 1513(a) is concerned with the basis on which the tax or charge is calculated. Property taxes, net income taxes, and franchise taxes are not imposed on one of the bases prohibited in \xc2\xa7 1513(a), and as explained above, are not included in \xc2\xa7 1513(a). Because the same language in \xc2\xa7 1513(a) restricts taxes as well as fees and other charges, it seems logical that the fees referred to in \xc2\xa7 1513(b), which also are not generally calculated on the bases listed in \xc2\xa7 1513(a), are similarly beyond \xc2\xa7 1513(a)\'s prohibition.</p><p>Section 1513(b)\'s reference to "reasonable" charges, then, does not impose a requirement that all airport user fees be "reasonable." Instead, it simply makes clear that state and local governments remain free to impose charges other than those proscribed by \xc2\xa7 1513(a). Cf. <i>Aloha Airlines, </i>464 U. S., at 12, n. 6 ("Section 1513(a) pre-empts a limited number of state taxes, ... [and] [\xc2\xa7]1513(b) clarifies Congress\' view that the States are still free to impose on airlines and air carriers \'taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a)\' "). That is not to say that the term "reasonable" is superfluous. Had the Act made unqualified reference to landing fees and other user fees, it might have been read as an indication of congressional intent to authorize fees or charges that would otherwise be invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause. See <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a>, 139 (1986). An unqualified reference might have also been understood to permit landing fees and other fees calculated on one of the bases prohibited by \xc2\xa7 1513(a). See n. 1, <i>supra. </i>By including the term "reasonable," Congress ensured that the Act would not</p><p>is a charge on the carriage of passengers traveling in air commerce within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1513(a). A landing fee is not such a prohibited charge where it is based merely on the weight of an airplane, as here. See App. 194 (Plaintiffs\' Trial Exh. 6: Fees for the Use of Public Aircraft Facilities and Rental for Passenger Terminal Premises, Kent County International Airport, Three Years Beginning Jan. 1, 1987 (Dec. 31, 1986)). Similarly, neither a rental fee based on square footage, see <i>ibid., </i>nor a carrying charge based on the depreciation of an asset, see App. 68-70 (trial testimony of Richard K. Dompke), is such a prohibited charge.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="379">379</a></p><p>be understood to displace the dormant Commerce Clause or to exempt user fees on aircraft operators <i>per se </i>from \xc2\xa7 1513(a). In short, \xc2\xa7 1513(b) merely clarifies that fees, taxes, and other charges not encompassed within \xc2\xa7 1513(a) may be imposed if consistent with our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.2</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The considerable difficulty the Court has in finding content for the term "reasonable" should signal that Congress did not intend the Act to impose a comprehensive new regulation on airport fees. As the Court admits, the Act itself sets no standards for reasonableness. <i>Ante, </i>at 366. Finding no other source for a definition, the Court uses <i>Evansville </i>as its test of reasonableness, apparently for want of anything better. See <i>ante, </i>at 367-368. The Court seems to recognize that this is not a perfect fit (but "will suffice for the purpose at hand," <i>ante, </i>at 368), and with good reason. Reasonableness was only one of several factors considered in <i>Evansville; </i>nondiscrimination against interstate commerce is a separate concern and is of at least equal importance. See 405 U. S., at 716-717. Moreover, as the Court acknowledges, Congress enacted the Act precisely because it found the result in <i>Evansville </i>"unsatisfactory." <i>Ante, </i>at 368.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Court reads the <i>Evansville </i>standard into the statute for no reason other than that the parties invite us to do so and that this Court (after enactment of the AHTA) occasionally has applied <i>Evansville </i>to test reasonableness in other contexts. <i>Ante, </i>at 367-368. That the parties agree on a standard, however, does not mean that it is the correct one. Moreover, it seems somewhat odd to import into the Act the very standard that created the problem Congress ostensibly intended the Act to "correct." Indeed, read as the Court construes it, the Act would fail to prohibit</p><p>2 Other statutory restrictions might also apply to the fees at issue here, see, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2210, but their applicability is not before us.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="380">380</a></p><p>precisely the sort of fees \xc2\xa7 1513(a) most clearly forbids. A head tax itself was held to be a "reasonable" user fee in <i>Evansville </i>(assuming, as the Court does, that <i>Evansville </i>applied a "reasonableness" standard). Under the Court\'s interpretation of the AHTA, there is nothing to prevent an airport from imposing a modest per passenger fee on airlines as a service charge for use of airport facilities.3 Such a fee would pass muster under <i>Evansville, </i>and therefore would be "saved" by \xc2\xa7 1513(b) as a "reasonable" fee, even though it is clearly a charge "on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce." \xc2\xa7 1513(a).4 It is doubtful that Congress intended the AHTA to prohibit "unreasonable" landing fees, whatever they might be, while permitting <i>"Evansville</i>reasonable" per capita user fees on aircraft operators. If, as the Court implies, Congress disapproved of the result but not the analysis in <i>Evansville, </i>it seems far more likely that it would have left the Commerce Clause analysis undisturbed while prohibiting head taxes and similar fees. In my view, that is precisely what \xc2\xa7 1513 does.</p><p>Having applied a construction of "reasonable" that it admits is not compelled by the Act, the Court invites the Secretary of Transportation to devise a different, presumably bet-</p><p>3 Presumably, under the Court\'s analysis, \xc2\xa7 1513(b) would not save head taxes exacted directly from passengers because it refers only to user fees collected "from aircraft operators."</p><p>4 It is no answer to say, as the Court does, <i>ante, </i>at 368, n. 13, that "head charges" are prohibited by \xc2\xa7 1513(a). In the Court\'s view, "user fees are [also] covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a)." <i>Ante, </i>at 366, n. 9. As the Court construes the Act, charges covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a) are permitted only if they are "saved" by \xc2\xa7 1513(b). <i>Ibid. </i>It is not clear why \xc2\xa7 1513(b) would save reasonable "fee[s]" and "other charge[s]" covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a) but not reasonable "head charge[s]" covered by \xc2\xa7 1513(a). Head charges certainly may constitute "reasonable ... service charges from aircraft operators for the use of airport facilities," \xc2\xa7 1513(b), if <i>Evansville </i>is the standard of reasonableness. See <i>Evansville- Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. </i>v. <i>Delta Airlines, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/707/case.html">405 U. S. 707</a>, 710, 714 (1972) (upholding a $1 per passenger "service charge" collected from air carriers for "use of runways and other airport facilities").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="381">381</a></p><p>ter, interpretation of the term, to which the Court will defer if it is a permissible construction of the Act.5 <i>Ante, </i>at 368, n. 14. Given that the Act sets no standards for "reasonableness," <i>ante, </i>at 366, it is difficult to imagine how the Secretary\'s interpretation could be an impermissible one. Indeed, although the Court seems to assume that the standard would be at least as rigorous as the one it applies here, presumably the Secretary could, in the exercise of his expertise, devise a more permissive standard. Under the Court\'s analysis, there is no reason to assume that the <i>Evansville </i>standard is a minimum. If the Act imposes the comprehensive regulation of the reasonableness of airport charges that the Court sees, it would certainly constitute a clear expression of Congress\' intention to displace the dormant Commerce Clause in this area, see <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i>477 U. S., at 139, in which case the Secretary would be free to regulate either more or less restrictively than would the dormant Commerce Clause. Cf. <i>Merrion </i>v. <i>Jicarilla Apache Tribe, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/130/case.html">455 U. S. 130</a>, 154 (1982). I simply find nothing in the AHTA that gives the Secretary such unbridled discretion to regulate all airport user fees.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Because the AHTA does not, in my view, apply to the fees in this case, it does not foreclose petitioners\' challenge under the dormant Commerce Clause.6 The courts below, how-</p><p>5 The Secretary of Transportation has not so far promulgated any regulatory standards for judging reasonableness under the Act. Although that fact is not directly relevant to our inquiry, it is surprising, if the Act means what the Court thinks it does, that the Secretary has not done so in the 20 years since the AHTA\'s enactment.</p><p>6 Nor, in my view, does the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA), 49 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2210, foreclose dormant Commerce Clause analysis here. Although the AAIA places a variety of conditions on federal funding of airports, some of which relate to user fees, it imposes no flat prohibitions, and therefore does not make" \'unmistakably clear\'" that it is intended to displace the dormant Commerce Clause. <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a>, 139 (1986).
