After the Internal Revenue Service found the tax shelter illegal, respondents filed a diversity suit against petitioners.  Claiming that equitable estoppel required respondents to arbitrate their claims per the agreements with Bricolage, petitioners invoked \xc2\xa73 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.

Section 16(a)(1)(A), in turn, allows an appeal from \xe2\x80\x9can order \xe2\x80\xa6 refusing a stay of any action under section 3.\xe2\x80\x9d  We address in this case whether appellate courts have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa716(a) to review denials of stays requested by litigants who were not parties to the relevant arbitration agreement, and whether \xc2\xa73 can ever mandate a stay in such circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents Wayne Carlisle, James Bushman, and Gary Strassel set out to minimize their taxes from the 1999 sale of their construction-equipment company.  Arthur Andersen LLP, a firm that had long served as their company\xe2\x80\x99s accountant, auditor, and tax adviser, introduced them to Bricolage Capital, LLC, which in turn referred them for legal advice to Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle, LLP.  According to respondents, these advisers recommended a \xe2\x80\x9cleveraged option strategy\xe2\x80\x9d tax shelter designed to create illusory losses through foreign-currency-exchange options.  As a part of the scheme, respondents invested in various stock warrants through newly created limited liability corporations (LLCs), which are also respondents in this case.  The respondent LLCs entered into investment-management agreements with Bricolage, specifying that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the br[ea]ch thereof, shall be settled by arbitration conducted in New York, New York, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 80\xe2\x80\x9381, 99\xe2\x80\x93100, 118\xe2\x80\x93119.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with all that seems too good to be true, a controversy did indeed arise.  The warrants respondents purchased turned out to be almost entirely worthless, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined in August 2000 that the \xe2\x80\x9cleveraged option strategy\xe2\x80\x9d scheme was an illegal tax shelter.  The IRS initially offered conditional amnesty to taxpayers who had used such arrangements, but petitioners failed to inform respondents of that option.  Respondents ultimately entered into a settlement program in which they paid the IRS all taxes, penalties, and interest owed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents filed this diversity suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky against Bricolage, Arthur Andersen and others[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] (all except Bricolage and its employees hereinafter referred to as petitioners), alleging fraud, civil conspiracy, malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence.  Petitioners moved to stay the action, invoking \xc2\xa73 of the FAA and arguing that the principles of equitable estoppel demanded that respondents arbitrate their claims under their investment agreements with Bricolage.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The District Court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal, which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  <em>Carlisle</em> v. <em>Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle, LLP,</em> 521 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 602 (2008).  We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ordinarily, courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions\xe2\x80\x9d of district courts.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291.  The FAA, however, makes an exception to that finality requirement, providing that \xe2\x80\x9can appeal may be taken from \xe2\x80\xa6 an order \xe2\x80\xa6 refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a)(1)(A).  By that provision\xe2\x80\x99s clear and unambiguous terms, any litigant who asks for a stay under \xc2\xa73 is entitled to an immediate appeal from denial of that motion\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether the litigant is in fact eligible for a stay.  Because each petitioner in this case explicitly asked for a stay pursuant to \xc2\xa73, App. 52, 54, 63, 65, the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The courts that have declined jurisdiction over \xc2\xa73 appeals of the sort at issue here have done so by conflating the jurisdictional question with the merits of the appeal.  They reason that because stay motions premised on equitable estoppel seek to expand (rather than simply vindicate) agreements, they are not cognizable under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73 and 4, and therefore the relevant motions are not actually \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d those provisions.  See, in addition to the opinion below,<em> </em>521 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 602, <em>DSMC Inc.</em> v. <em>Convera Corp.</em>, 349 F.\xc2\xa03d 679, 682\xe2\x80\x93685 (CADC 2003); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Universal Serv. Fund Tel. Billing Practice Litigation</em> v. <em>Sprint Communications Co.</em>, 428 F.\xc2\xa03d 940, 944\xe2\x80\x93945 (CA10 2005).  The dissent makes this step explicit, by reading the appellate jurisdictional provision of \xc2\xa716 as \xe2\x80\x9ccalling for a look-through\xe2\x80\x9d to the substantive provisions of \xc2\xa73.  <em>Post</em>, at 2.  Jurisdiction over the appeal, however, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be determined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Behrens</em> v. <em>Pelletier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/299/index.html">516 U. S. 299</a>, 311 (1996).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The jurisdictional statute here unambiguously makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even utter frivolousness of the underlying request for a \xc2\xa73 stay cannot turn a denial into something other than \xe2\x80\x9can order \xe2\x80\xa6 refusing a stay of any action under section 3.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that this reading of \xc2\xa716(a) will produce a long parade of horribles, enmeshing courts in fact-intensive jurisdictional inquiries and permitting frivolous interlocutory appeals.  Even if these objections could surmount the plain language of the statute, we would not be persuaded.  Determination of whether \xc2\xa73 was invoked in a denied stay request is immeasurably more simple and less factbound than the threshold determination respondents would replace it with: whether the litigant was a party to the contract (an especially difficult question when the written agreement is not signed).  It is more appropriate to grapple with that merits question after the court has accepted jurisdiction over the case.  Second, there are ways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals.  Appellate courts can streamline the disposition of meritless claims and even authorize the district court\xe2\x80\x99s retention of jurisdiction when an appeal is certified as frivolous.  See <em>Behrens</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 310\xe2\x80\x93311.  And, of course, those inclined to file dilatory appeals must be given pause by courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to \xe2\x80\x9caward just damages and single or double costs to the appellee\xe2\x80\x9d whenever an appeal is \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule App. Proc. 38.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Court of Appeals were correct that it had no jurisdiction over meritless appeals, its ground for finding this appeal meritless was in error.  We take the trouble to address that alternative ground, since if the Court of Appeals is correct on the merits point we will have awarded petitioners a remarkably hollow victory.  We consider, therefore, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s underlying determination that those who are not parties to a written arbitration agreement are categorically ineligible for relief.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2\xe2\x80\x94the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s substantive mandate\xe2\x80\x94makes written arbitration agreements \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  That provision creates substantive federal law regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements, requiring courts \xe2\x80\x9cto place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a>, 478 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 3, in turn, allows litigants already in federal court to invoke agreements made enforceable by \xc2\xa72.  That provision requires the court, \xe2\x80\x9con application of one of the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] to stay the action if it involves an \xe2\x80\x9cissue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither provision purports to alter background principles of state contract law regarding the scope of agreements<em> </em>(including the question of who is bound by them).  Indeed \xc2\xa72 explicitly retains an external body of law governing revocation (such grounds \xe2\x80\x9cas exist at law or in equity\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  And we think \xc2\xa73 adds no substantive restriction to \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s enforceability mandate.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate law,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, is applicable to determine which contracts are binding under \xc2\xa72 and enforceable under \xc2\xa73 \xe2\x80\x9c<em>if</em> that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perry</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/483/index.html">482 U. S. 483</a>, 493, n. 9 (1987).  See also <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html">514 U. S. 938</a>, 944 (1995).  Because \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional principles\xe2\x80\x9d of state law allow a contract to be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract through \xe2\x80\x9cassumption, piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver and estoppel,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa757:19, p. 183 (4th ed. 2001), the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding that nonparties to a contract are categorically barred from \xc2\xa73 relief was error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that, as a matter of federal law, claims to arbitration by nonparties are not \xe2\x80\x9creferable to arbitration <em>under </em>an agreement in writing,\xe2\x80\x9d 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73 (emphasis added), because they \xe2\x80\x9cseek to bind a signatory to an arbitral obligation <em>beyond </em>that signatory\xe2\x80\x99s strictly contractual obligation to arbitrate,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 26.  Perhaps that would be true if \xc2\xa73 mandated stays only for disputes between parties to a written arbitration agreement.  But that is not what the statute says.  It says that stays are required if the claims are \xe2\x80\x9creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  If a written arbitration provision is made enforceable against (or for the benefit of) a third party under state contract law, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms are fulfilled.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 final fallback consists of reliance upon dicta in our opinions, such as the statement that \xe2\x80\x9carbitration \xe2\x80\xa6 is a way to resolve those disputes\xe2\x80\x94but only those disputes\xe2\x80\x94that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>First Options, supra,</em> at 943, and the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a nonparty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Waffle House, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/279/index.html">534 U. S. 279</a>, 294 (2002).  The former statement pertained to <em>issues </em>parties agreed to arbitrate, and the latter referred to an entity (the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) which obviously had no third-party obligations under the contract in question.  Neither these nor any of our other cases have presented for decision the question whether arbitration agreements that are otherwise enforceable by (or against) third parties trigger protection under the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents may be correct in saying that courts\xe2\x80\x99 application of equitable estoppel to impose an arbitration agreement upon strangers to the contract has been \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat loose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 27, n.\xc2\xa015.  But we need not decide here whether the relevant state contract law recognizes equitable estoppel as a ground for enforcing contracts against third parties, what standard it would apply, and whether petitioners would be entitled to relief under it.  These questions have not been briefed before us and can be addressed on remand.  It suffices to say that no federal law bars the State from allowing petitioners to enforce the arbitration agreement against respondents and that \xc2\xa73 would require a stay in this case if it did.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request for a \xc2\xa73 stay and that a litigant who was not a party to the relevant arbitration agreement may invoke \xc2\xa73 if the relevant state contract law allows him to enforce the agreement.

Respondents have not relied upon this line of cases as an alternative rationale for rejection of jurisdiction, and there are good reasons for treating subject-matter jurisdiction differently, in that respect, from the appellate jurisdiction here conferred.  A frivolous federal claim, if sufficient to confer jurisdiction, would give the court power to hear related state-law claims, see 28 U.

CARLISLE<br/>\n556 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 08-146<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS\n<em>v.</em> WAYNE CARLISLE et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[May 4, 2009]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Souter, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) authorizes an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion under \xc2\xa73 to stay a district court action pending arbitration.  The question is whether it opens the door to such an appeal at the behest of one who has not signed a written arbitration agreement.  Based on the longstanding congressional policy limiting interlocutory appeals, I think the better reading of the statutory provisions disallows such an appeal, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 16(a) of the FAA provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n appeal may be taken from . . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(a).  The Court says that any litigant who asks for and is denied a \xc2\xa73 stay is entitled to an immediate appeal.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s assumption is that \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 3\xe2\x80\x9d is merely a labeling requirement, without substantive import, but this fails to read \xc2\xa716 in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirm congressional policy against interlocutory or \xe2\x80\x98piecemeal\xe2\x80\x99 appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Abney</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/651/index.html">431 U. S. 651</a>, 656 (1977).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right of appeal is \xe2\x80\x9ca creature of statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., and Congress has granted the Federal Courts of Appeals jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>DiBella</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/121/index.html">369 U. S. 121</a>, 124 (1962).  Congress has, however, \xe2\x80\x9crecognized the need of exceptions for interlocutory orders in certain types of proceedings where the damage of error unreviewed before the judgment is definitive and complete . . . has been deemed greater than the disruption caused by intermediate appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Section 16 functions as one such exception, but departures from \xe2\x80\x9cthe dominant rule in federal appellate practice,\xe2\x80\x9d 9 J. Moore, B. Ward, &amp; J. Lucas, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice \xc2\xb6110.06 (2d ed. 1996), are extraordinary interruptions to the normal process of litigation and ought to be limited carefully.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An obvious way to limit the scope of such an extraordinary interruption would be to read the \xc2\xa716 requirement that the stay have been denied \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 3\xe2\x80\x9d as calling for a look-through to the provisions of \xc2\xa73, and to read \xc2\xa73 itself as offering a stay only to signatories of an arbitration agreement.  It is perfectly true that in general a third-party beneficiary can enforce a contract, but this is a weak premise for inferring an intent to allow third parties to obtain a \xc2\xa73 stay and take a \xc2\xa716 appeal.  While it is hornbook contract law that third parties may enforce contracts for their benefit as a matter of course, interlocutory appeals are a matter of limited grace.  Because it would therefore seem strange to assume that Congress meant to grant the right to appeal a \xc2\xa73 stay denial to anyone as peripheral to the core agreement as a nonsignatory, it follows that Congress probably intended to limit those able to seek a \xc2\xa73 stay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Asking whether a \xc2\xa73 movant is a signatory provides a bright-line rule with predictable results to aid courts in determining jurisdiction over \xc2\xa716 interlocutory appeals.  And that rule has the further virtue of mitigating the risk of intentional delay by savvy parties who seek to frustrate litigation by gaming the system.  Why not move for a \xc2\xa73 stay?  If granted, arbitration will be mandated, and if denied, a lengthy appeal may wear down the opponent.  The majority contends, <em>ante</em>, at 5, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are ways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yes, but the sanctions suggested apply to the frivolous, not to the far-fetched; and as the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concludes, such an attenuated claim of equitable estoppel as petitioners raise here falls well short of the sanctionable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because petitioners were not parties to the written arbitration agreement, I would hold they could not move to stay the District Court proceedings under \xc2\xa73, with the consequence that the Court of Appeals would have no jurisdiction under \xc2\xa716 to entertain their appeal.  I would accordingly affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
