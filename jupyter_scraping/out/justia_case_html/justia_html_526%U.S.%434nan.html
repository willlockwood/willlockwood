Mter the Debtor defaulted and the Bank began state-court foreclosure, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1101 <i>et seq. </i>The Debtor proposed a reorganization plan under which, <i>inter alia, </i>certain of its former partners would contribute new capital in exchange for the Debtor\'s entire ownership of the reorganized entity. That condition was an exclusive eligibility provision: the old equity holders were the only ones who could contribute new capital. The Bank objected and, as sole member of an impaired class of creditors, thereby blocked confirmation of the plan on a consensual basis. See \xc2\xa7 1129(a)(8). The Debtor, however, resorted to the alternate, judicial "cramdown" process for imposing a plan on a dissenting class. \xc2\xa7 1129(b). Among the conditions for a cramdown is the requirement that the plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to each class of impaired unsecured claims that has not accepted it. \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(1). A plan may be found to be fair and equitable if "the holder of any claim ... junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim ... any property." \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). Under this "absolute priority rule," the Bank argued, the plan could not be confirmed as a cramdown because the Debtor\'s old equity holders would receive property even though the Bank\'s unsecured deficiency claim would not be paid in full. The Bankruptcy Court approved the plan nonetheless, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Seventh Circuit found ambiguity in the absolute priority rule\'s language, and interpreted the phrase "on account of" to permit recognition of a "new value corollary" to the rule, under which the objection of an impaired senior class does not bar junior claim holders from receiving or retaining property interests in the debtor after reorganization, if they contribute new capital in money or money\'s worth, reasonably equivalent to the property\'s value, and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="435">435</a></p><p>necessary for successful reorganization of the restructured enterprise.

In this case, the proposed plan is doomed by its provision for vesting equity in the reorganized business in the Debtor\'s partners without extending an opportunity to anyone else either to compete for that equity or to propose a competing reorganization plan. The exclusiveness of the opportunity, with its protection against the market\'s scrutiny of the stated purchase price, renders the partners\' right a property interest extended "on account of" the old equity position and therefore subject to an unpaid senior creditor class\'s objection. Under a plan granting old equity on exclusive right, any determination that the purchase price was top dollar would necessarily be made by the bankruptcy judge, whereas the best way to determine value is exposure to a market. In the interest of statutory coherence, the Bankruptcy Code\'s disfavor for decisions untested by competitive choice ought to extend to valuations in administering \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) when some form of market valuation may be available to test the adequacy of an old equity holder\'s proposed contribution.

In January 1995, the Debtor defaulted, and the Bank began foreclosure in a state court.</p><p>In March, the Debtor responded with a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1101 <i>et seq., </i>which automatically stayed the foreclosure proceedings, see \xc2\xa7 362(a). <i>In re 203 </i>N. <i>LaSalle Street Partnership, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/126/955/">126 F.3d 955</a>, 958 <i>(CA7 </i>1997); <i>Bank of America, Illinois </i>v. <i>203 </i>N. <i>LaSalle Street Partnership, </i>195 B.

R., at 698. The Debtor proceeded to propose a reorganization plan during the 120-day period when it alone had the right to do so, see 11 U. s.

The Bank objected, and the Bankruptcy Court rejected the plan on the ground that it was not feasible. See \xc2\xa7 1129(a)(11). The Debtor submitted a new plan on September 11, 1995. <i>In re 203 N.

Under the plan, the Debtor separately classified the Bank\'s secured claim, its unsecured deficiency claim, and unsecured trade debt owed to other creditors. See \xc2\xa7 1122(a).7 The Bankruptcy Court found that the Debtor\'s available assets were prepetition rents in a cash account of $3.1 million and the 15 floors of rental property worth $54.5 million. The secured claim was valued at the latter figure, leaving the Bank with an unsecured deficiency of $38.5 million.</p><p>So far as we need be concerned here, the Debtor\'s plan had these further features:</p><p>5 The Bank neither appealed the denial nor raised it as an issue in this appeal.</p><p>6 Having agreed to waive recourse against any property of the Debtor other than the real estate, the Bank had no unsecured claim outside of Chapter 11. Section 1111(b), however, provides that nonrecourse secured creditors who are undersecured must be treated in Chapter 11 as if they had recourse.</p><p>7 Indeed, the Seventh Circuit apparently requires separate classification of the deficiency claim of an undersecured creditor from other general unsecured claims. See <i>In re Woodbrook Associates, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/19/312/">19 F.3d 312</a>, 319 (1994). Nonetheless, the Bank argued that if its deficiency claim had been included in the class of general unsecured creditors, its vote against confirmation would have resulted in the plan\'s rejection by that class. The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court rejected the contention that the classifications were gerrymandered to obtain requisite approval by a single class, <i>In re 203 N.

See generally Klee, All You Ever Wanted to Know About Cram Down Under the New Bankruptcy Code, 53 Am. Bankr. L. J. 133 (1979).</p><p>There are two conditions for a cram down. First, all requirements of \xc2\xa7 1129(a) must be met (save for the plan\'s acceptance by each impaired class of claims or interests, see \xc2\xa7 1129(a)(8)). Critical among them are the conditions that the plan be accepted by at least one class of impaired creditors, see \xc2\xa7 1129(a)(10), and satisfy the "best-interest-ofcreditors" test, see \xc2\xa7 1129(a)(7).13 Here, the class of trade creditors with impaired unsecured claims voted for the plan,14 126 F. 3d, at 959, and there was no issue of best interest. Second, the objection of an impaired creditor class may be overridden only if "the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan." \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(1). As to a dissenting class of impaired unsecured creditors, such a plan may be found to be "fair and equitable" only if the allowed value of the claim is to be paid in full, \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(i), or, in the alternative,</p><p>12 A class of creditors accepts if a majority of the creditors and those holding two-thirds of the total dollar amount of the claims within that class vote to approve the plan. \xc2\xa7 1126(c).</p><p>13 Section 1129(a)(7) provides that if the holder of a claim impaired under a plan of reorganization has not accepted the plan, then such holder must "receive ... on account of such claim ... property of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount that such holder would so receive ... if the debtor were liquidated under chapter 7 ... on such date." The "best interests" test applies to individual creditors holding impaired claims, even if the class as a whole votes to accept the plan.</p><p>14 Claims are unimpaired if they retain all of their prepetition legal, equitable, and contractual rights against the debtor. \xc2\xa7 1124.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="442">442</a></p><p>442 BANK OF AMERICA NAT.

That latter condition is the core of what is known as the "absolute priority rule."</p><p>The absolute priority rule was the basis for the Bank\'s position that the plan could not be confirmed as a cramdown. As the Bank read the rule, the plan was open to objection simply because certain old equity holders in the Debtor Partnership would receive property even though the Bank\'s unsecured deficiency claim would not be paid in full. The Bankruptcy Court approved the plan nonetheless, and accordingly denied the Bank\'s pending motion to convert the case to Chapter 7 liquidation, or to dismiss the case. The District Court affirmed, 195 B. R. 692 (ND Ill. 1996), as did the Court of Appeals.</p><p>The majority of the Seventh Circuit\'s divided panel found ambiguity in the language of the statutory absolute priority rule, and looked beyond the text to interpret the phrase "on account of" as permitting recognition of a "new value corollary" to the rule. 126 F. 3d, at 964-965. According to the panel, the corollary, as stated by this Court in <i>Case </i>v. <i>Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/106/case.html">308 U. S. 106</a>, 118 (1939), provides that the objection of an impaired senior class does not bar junior claim holders from receiving or retaining property interests in the debtor after reorganization, if they contribute new capital in money or money\'s worth, reasonably equivalent to the property\'s value, and necessary for successful reorganization of the restructured enterprise.

The Bankruptcy Act preceding the Code contained no such provision as subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii), its subject having been addressed by two interpretive rules. The first was a specific gloss on the requirement of \xc2\xa7 77B (and its successor, Chapter X) of the old Act, that any reorganization plan be "fair and equitable." 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 205(e) (1934 ed., Supp. I) (repealed 1938) (\xc2\xa7 77B); 11 u. S. C. \xc2\xa7 621(2) (1934 ed., Supp. IV) (repealed 1979) (Chapter X). The reason for such a limitation was the danger inherent in any reorganization plan proposed by a debtor, then and now, that the plan will simply turn out to be too good a deal for the debtor\'s owners. See H. R. Doc. No. 93-137, pt. I, p. 255 (1973) (discussing concern with "the ability of a few insiders, whether representatives of management or major creditors, to use the reorganization process to gain an unfair advantage"); <i>ibid. </i>("[I]t was believed that creditors, because of management\'s position of dominance, were not able to bargain effectively without a clear standard of fairness and judicial control"); Ayer, Rethinking Absolute Priority After <i>Ahlers, </i>87 Mich. L. Rev. 963, 969-973 (1989). Hence the pre-Code judicial response known as the absolute priority rule, that fairness and equity required that "the creditors ... be paid before the stockholders could retain [equity interests] for any purpose whatever." <i>Northern Pacific R. Co. </i>v. <i>Boyd, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/482/case.html">228 U. S. 482</a>, 508 (1913). See also <i>Louisville Trust Co. </i>v. <i>Louisville, </i>N. <i>A. </i>&amp; C. <i>R.

S. 674</a>, 684 (1899) (reciting "the familiar rule that the stockholder\'s interest in the property is subordinate to the rights of creditors; first of secured and then of unsecured creditors," and concluding that "any arrangement of the parties by which the subordi-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="445">445</a></p><p>nate rights and interests of the stockholders are attempted to be secured at the expense of the prior rights of either class of creditors comes within judicial denunciation").</p><p>The second interpretive rule addressed the first. Its classic formulation occurred in <i>Case </i>v. <i>Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., </i>in which the Court spoke through Justice Douglas in this dictum:</p><blockquote><p>\n"It is, of course, clear that there are circumstances under which stockholders may participate in a plan of reorganization of an insolvent debtor ....

S., at 121-122.</p></blockquote><p>Although counsel for one of the parties here has described the <i>Case </i>observation as "\'black-letter\' principle," Brief for Respondent 38, it never rose above the technical level of dictum in any opinion of this Court, which last addressed it in <i>Norwest Bank Worthington </i>v. <i>Ahlers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/197/case.html">485 U.

See Ayer, <i>supra, </i>at 1016; Markell, Owners, Auctions, and Absolute Priority in Bankruptcy Reorganizations, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 69, 92 (1991). Hence the controversy over how weighty the <i>Case </i>dictum had become, as reflected in the alternative labels for the new value notion: some writers and courts (including this one, see <i>Ahlers, supra, </i>at 203-204, n. 3) have spoken of it as an exception to the absolute priority rule, see, <i>e. g., In re Potter Material Service, Inc., 781 </i>F. 2d 99, 101 (CA7 1986); Miller, Bankruptcy\'s New Value Exception: No Longer a Necessity, 77 B. U. L. Rev. 975 (1997); Georgakopoulos, New Value, Fresh Start, 3 Stan. J. L. Bus. &amp; Fin. 125 (1997), while others have characterized it as a simple corollary to the rule, see, <i>e. g., In re Bonner Mall Partnership, </i>2 F. 3d, at 906; Ayer, <i>supra, </i>at 999.</p><p>Enactment of the Bankruptcy Code in place of the prior Act might have resolved the status of new value by a provision bearing its name or at least unmistakably couched in its terms, but the Congress chose not to avail itself of that opportunity.

After extensive hearings, a substantially revised House bill emerged, but without any provision for nonmonetary new value contributions. See H.

(1977), which would eventually become the law, H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 3 (1977). It had no explicit new value language, expansive or otherwise, but did codify the absolute priority rule in nearly its present form. See H. R. 8200, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(iv) ("[T]he holders of claims or interests of any class of claims or interests, as the case may be, that is junior to such class will not receive or retain under</p><p>17Section 7-303(4) read: "[W]hen the equity security holders retain an interest under the plan, the individual debtor, certain partners or equity security holders will make a contribution which is important to the operation of the reorganized debtor or the successor under the plan, for participation by the individual debtor, such partners, or such holders under the plan on a basis which reasonably approximates the value, if any, of their interests, and the additional estimated value of such contribution."</p><p>18 Section 7-31O(d)(2)(B) read: "Subject to the provisions of section 7-303 (3) and (4) and the court\'s making any findings required thereby, there is a reasonable basis for the valuation on which the plan is based and the plan is fair and equitable in that there is a reasonable probability that the securities issued and other consideration distributed under the plan will fully compensate the respective classes of creditors and equity security holders of the debtor for their respective interests in the debtor or his property."</p><p>19 Section 1129(b) of H.

Although hornbook law has it that "\'Congress does not intend <i>sub silentio </i>to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded,\'" <i>INS </i>v. <i>Cardoza-Fonseca, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html">480 U. S. 421</a>, 442-443 (1987), the phrase "on account of" is not <i>silentium, </i>and the language passed by in this instance had never been in the bill finally enacted, but only in predecessors that died on the vine. None of these contained an explicit codification of the absolute priority rule,21 and even in these earlier bills the language in question stated an expansive new value concept, not the rule as limited in the <i>Case </i>dictum.22</p><p>The equivocal note of this drafting history is amplified by another feature of the legislative advance toward the current law. Any argument from drafting history has to account for the fact that the Code does not codify any authoritative pre-Code version of the absolute priority rule. Compare \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) ("[T]he holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such [impaired unsecured] class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property") with <i>Boyd, </i>228 U.

S. 445</a>, 455 (1926))). See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 414 (characterizing \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) as a "partial codification of the absolute priority rule"); ibid. ("The elements of the [fair and equitable] test are new[,] departing from both the absolute priority rule and the best interests of creditors tests found under the Bankruptcy Act").</p><p>The upshot is that this history does nothing to disparage the possibility apparent in the statutory text, that the absolute priority rule now on the books as subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) may carry a new value corollary. Although there is no literal reference to "new value" in the phrase "on account of such junior claim," the phrase could arguably carry such an implication in modifying the prohibition against receipt by junior claimants of any interest under a plan while a senior class of unconsenting creditors goes less than fully paid.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Three basic interpretations have been suggested for the "on account of" modifier. The first reading is proposed by the Partnership, that "on account of" harks back to accounting practice and means something like "in exchange for," or "in satisfaction of," Brief for Respondent 12-13, 15, n. 16. On this view, a plan would not violate the absolute priority rule unless the old equity holders received or retained property in exchange for the prior interest, without any significant new contribution; if substantial money passed from them as part of the deal, the prohibition of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) would not stand in the way, and whatever issues of fairness and equity there might otherwise be would not implicate the "on account of" modifier.</p><p>This position is beset with troubles, the first one being textual. Subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) forbids not only receipt of property on account of the prior interest but its retention as well. See also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1129(a)(7)(A)(ii), (a)(7)(B), (b)(2)(B)(i), (b)(2)(C)(i), (b)(2)(C)(ii). A common instance of the latter</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="450">450</a></p><p>450 BANK OF AMERICA NAT. TRUST AND SAY. ASSN. <i>v. </i>203 NORTH LASALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP</p><p>would be a debtor\'s retention of an interest in the insolvent business reorganized under the plan. Yet it would be exceedingly odd to speak of "retain[ingJ" property in exchange for the same property interest, and the eccentricity of such a reading is underscored by the fact that elsewhere in the Code the drafters chose to use the very phrase "in exchange for," \xc2\xa7 1123(a)(5)(J) (a plan shall provide adequate means for implementation, including "issuance of securities of the debtor ... for cash, for property, for existing securities, or in exchange for claims or interests"). It is unlikely that the drafters of legislation so long and minutely contemplated as the 1978 Bankruptcy Code would have used two distinctly different forms of words for the same purpose. See <i>Russello </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/case.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23 (1983).</p><p>The second difficulty is practical: the unlikelihood that Congress meant to impose a condition as manipulable as subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) would be if "on account of" meant to prohibit merely an exchange unaccompanied by a substantial infusion of new funds but permit one whenever substantial funds changed hands. "Substantial" or "significant" or "considerable" or like characterizations of a monetary contribution would measure it by the Lord Chancellor\'s foot, and an absolute priority rule so variable would not be much of an absolute. Of course it is true (as already noted) that, even if old equity holders could displace the rule by adding some significant amount of cash to the deal, it would not follow that their plan would be entitled to adoption; a contested plan would still need to satisfy the overriding condition of fairness and equity. But that general fairness and equity criterion would apply in any event, and one comes back to the question why Congress would have bothered to add a separate priority rule without a sharper edge.</p><p>Since the "in exchange for" reading merits rejection, the way is open to recognize the more common understanding of "on account of" to mean "because of." This is certainly the usage meant for the phrase at other places in the stat-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="451">451</a></p><p>ute, see \xc2\xa7 1111(b)(1)(A) (treating certain claims as if the holder of the claim "had recourse against the debtor on account of such claim"); \xc2\xa7 522(d)(10)(E) (permitting debtors to exempt payments under certain benefit plans and contracts "on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service"); \xc2\xa7 547(b)(2) (authorizing trustee to avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property "for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor"); \xc2\xa7 547(c)(4)(B) (barring trustee from avoiding a transfer when a creditor gives new value to the debtor "on account of which new value the debtor did not make an otherwise unavoidable transfer to ... such creditor"). So, under the commonsense rule that a given phrase is meant to carry a given concept in a single statute, see <i>Cohen </i>v. <i>de la Cruz, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/213/case.html">523 U. S. 213</a>, 219220 (1998), the better reading of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) recognizes that a causal relationship between holding the prior claim or interest and receiving or retaining property is what activates the absolute priority rule.</p><p>The degree of causation is the final bone of contention.</p><p>We understand the Government, as <i>amicus curiae, </i>to take the starchy position not only that any degree of causation between earlier interests and retained property will activate the bar to a plan providing for later property, Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>11-15, but also that whenever the holders of equity in the Debtor end up with some property there will be some causation; when old equity, and not someone on the street, gets property the reason is <i>res ipsa loquitur. </i>An old equity holder simply cannot take property under a plan if creditors are not paid in full. <i>Id., </i>at 10-11, 18. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.23</p><p>23 Our interpretation of the Government\'s position in this respect is informed by its view as <i>amicus curiae </i>in the <i>Bonner Mall </i>case: "the language and structure of the Code prohibit in all circumstances confirmation of a plan that grants the prior owners an equity interest in the reorganized debtor over the objection of a class of unpaid unsecured claims."

TRUST AND SAY. ASSN. <i>v. </i>203 NORTH LASALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP</p><p>There are, however, reasons counting against such a reading. If, as is likely, the drafters were treating junior claimants or interest holders as a class at this point (see <i>Ahlers, </i>485 U. S., at 202),24 then the simple way to have prohibited the old interest holders from receiving anything over objection would have been to omit the "on account of" phrase entirely from subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii). On this assumption, reading the provision as a blanket prohibition would leave "on account of" as a redundancy, contrary to the interpretive obligation to try to give meaning to all the statutory language. See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Moskal </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/103/case.html">498 U. S. 103</a>, 109-110 (1990); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Menasche, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/case.html">348 U. S. 528</a>, 538-539 (1955).25 One would also have to ask why Congress</p><p>Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, O. T. 1993, No. 93714, p. 14.</p><p>The Government conceded that, in the case before us, it had no need to press this more stringent view, since "whatever [the] definition of \'on account of,\' a 100 percent certainty that junior equit[y] obtains property because they\'re junior equity will satisfy that." See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 (internal quotation marks added).</p><p>24 It is possible, on the contrary, to argue on the basis of the immediate text that the prohibition against receipt of an interest "on account of" a prior unsecured claim or interest was meant to indicate only that there is no <i>per se </i>bar to such receipt by a creditor holding both a senior secured claim and a junior unsecured one, when the senior secured claim accounts for the subsequent interest. This reading would of course eliminate the phrase "on account of" as an express source of a new value exception, but would leave open the possibility of interpreting the absolute priority rule itself as stopping short of prohibiting a new value transaction.</p><p>25 Given our obligation to give meaning to the "on account of" modifier, we likewise do not rely on various statements in the House Report or by the bill\'s floor leaders, which, when read out of context, imply that Congress intended an emphatic, unconditional absolute priority rule. See, <i>e. </i>g., H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 224 (1977) ("[T]he bill requires that the plan pay any dissenting class in full before any class junior to the dissenter may be paid at all"); id., at 413 ("[I]f [an impaired class is] paid less than in full, then no class junior may receive anything under the plan"); 124 Congo Rec. 32408 (1978) (statement of Rep.

Although we have some doubt about the Court of Appeals\'s assumption (see 126 F. 3d, at 966, and n. 12) that prior equity is often the only source of significant capital for reorganizations, see, <i>e. </i>g., Blum &amp; Kaplan, The Absolute Priority Doctrine in Corporate Reorganizations, 41 U. Chi. L. Rev. 651, 672 (1974); Mann, Strategy and Force in the Liquidation of Secured Debt, 96 Mich. L. Rev. 159, 182-183, 192194, 208-209 (1997), old equity may well be in the best position to make a go of the reorganized enterprise and so may be the party most likely to work out an equity-for-value reorganization.</p><p>A less absolute statutory prohibition would follow from reading the "on account of" language as intended to reconcile the two recognized policies underlying Chapter 11, of preserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors, see <i>Toibb </i>v. <i>Radloff, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/157/case.html">501 U. S. 157</a>, 163 (1991). Causation between the old equity\'s holdings and subsequent property substantial enough to disqualify a plan would presumably occur on this view of things whenever old equity\'s later property would come at a price that failed to provide the greatest possible addition to the bankruptcy estate, and it would always come at a price too low when the equity holders obtained or preserved an ownership interest for less than someone else would have paid.26 A truly full</p><p>firm able only "as long as no class junior to the dissenting class receives anything at all"); id., at 34007 (statement of Sen.

On this interpretation, disproof of a bargain would not satisfy old equity\'s burden; it would need to show that no one else would pay as much.

It is doomed, we can say without necessarily exhausting its flaws, by its provision for vesting equity in the reorganized business in the Debtor\'s partners without extending an opportunity to anyone else either to compete for that equity or to propose a competing reorganization plan. Although the Debtor\'s exclusive opportunity to propose a plan under \xc2\xa7 1121(b) is not itself "property" within the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii), the respondent partnership in this case has taken advantage of this opportunity by proposing a plan under which the benefit of equity ownership may be obtained by no one but old equity partners. Upon the court\'s approval of that plan, the partners were in the same position that they would have enjoyed had they exercised an exclusive option under the plan to buy the equity in the reorganized entity, or contracted to purchase it from a seller who had first agreed to deal with no one else. It is quite true that the escrow of the partners\' proposed investment eliminated any formal need to set out an express</p><p><i>e. g., In re Coltex Loop Central Three Partners, L.

But before the Debtor\'s plan was accepted no one else could propose an alternative one, and after its acceptance no one else could obtain equity in the reorganized entity. At the moment of the plan\'s approval the Debtor\'s partners necessarily enjoyed an exclusive opportunity that was in no economic sense distinguishable from the advantage of the exclusively entitled offeror or option holder. This opportunity should, first of all, be treated as an item of property in its own right. Cf. <i>In re Coltex Loop Central Three Partners, </i>L. P., 138 F. 3d, at 43 (exclusive right to purchase postpetition equity is itself property); <i>In re Bryson Properties, XVIII, </i>961 F. 2d, at 504; <i>Kham </i>&amp; <i>Nate\'s Shoes No.2, Inc. </i>v. <i>First Bank, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/908/1351/">908 F.2d 1351</a>, 1360 <i>(CA7 </i>1990); D. Baird, The Elements of Bankruptcy 261 (rev. ed. 1993) ("The right to get an equity interest for its fair market value is \'property\' as the word is ordinarily used. Options to acquire an interest in a firm, even at its market value, trade for a positive price"). While it may be argued that the opportunity has no market value, being significant only to old equity holders owing to their potential tax liability, such an argument avails the Debtor nothing, for several reasons. It is to avoid just such arguments that the law is settled that any otherwise cognizable property interest must be treated as sufficiently valuable to be recognized under the Bankruptcy Code. See <i>Ahlers, </i>485 U. S., at 207-208. Even aside from that rule, the assumption that no one but the Debtor\'s partners might pay for such an opportunity would obviously support no inference that it is valueless, let alone that it should not be treated as property. And, finally, the source in the tax law of the opportunity\'s value to the partners implies in no way that it lacks value to others. It might, indeed, be valuable to another precisely as a way to keep the Debtor from implementing a plan that would avoid a Chapter 7 liquidation.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="456">456</a></p><p>456 BANK OF AMERICA NAT. TRUST AND SAY. ASSN. <i>v. </i>203 NORTH LASALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP</p><p>Given that the opportunity is property of some value, the question arises why old equity alone should obtain it, not to mention at no cost whatever. The closest thing to an answer favorable to the Debtor is that the old equity partners would be given the opportunity in the expectation that in taking advantage of it they would add the stated purchase price to the estate. See Brief for Respondent 40-41. But this just begs the question why the opportunity should be exclusive to the old equity holders. If the price to be paid for the equity interest is the best obtainable, old equity does not need the protection of exclusiveness (unless to trump an equal offer from someone else); if it is not the best, there is no apparent reason for giving old equity a bargain. There is no reason, that is, unless the very purpose of the whole transaction is, at least in part, to do old equity a favor. And that, of course, is to say that old equity would obtain its opportunity, and the resulting benefit, because of old equity\'s prior interest within the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii). Hence it is that the exclusiveness of the opportunity, with its protection against the market\'s scrutiny of the purchase price by means of competing bids or even competing plan proposals, renders the partners\' right a property interest extended "on account of" the old equity position and therefore subject to an unpaid senior creditor class\'s objection.</p><p>It is no answer to this to say that the exclusive opportunity should be treated merely as a detail of the broader transaction that would follow its exercise, and that in this wider perspective no favoritism may be inferred, since the old equity partners would pay something, whereas no one else would pay anything. If this argument were to carry the day, of course, old equity could obtain a new property interest for a dime without being seen to receive anything on account of its old position. But even if we assume that old equity\'s plan would not be confirmed without satisfying the judge that the purchase price was top dollar, there is a further reason here not to treat property consisting of an exclusive opportunity as subsumed within the total trans-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="457">457</a></p><p>action proposed. On the interpretation assumed here, it would, of course, be a fatal flaw if old equity acquired or retained the property interest without paying full value. It would thus be necessary for old equity to demonstrate its payment of top dollar, but this it could not satisfactorily do when it would receive or retain its property under a plan giving it exclusive rights and in the absence of a competing plan of any sort.27 Under a plan granting an exclusive right, making no provision for competing bids or competing plans, any determination that the price was top dollar would necessarily be made by a judge in bankruptcy court, whereas the best way to determine value is exposure to a market.

I therefore concur only in the judgment.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Our precedents make clear that an analysis of any statute, including the Bankruptcy Code, must not begin with external sources, but with the text itself. See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Connecticut Nat. Bank </i>v. <i>Germain, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/case.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 253-254 (1992); <i>Union Bank </i>v. <i>Wolas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/151/case.html">502 U. S. 151</a>, 154 (1991). The relevant Code provision in this case, 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1129(b), does not expressly authorize prepetition equity holders to receive or retain property in a reorganized entity in exchange for an infusion of new capital.1 Instead, it is cast in general terms and requires that, to be confirmed over the objections of an impaired class of creditors, a reorganization plan be "fair and equitable." \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(1). With respect to an impaired class of unsecured creditors, a plan can be fair and equitable only if, at a minimum, it "provides that each holder of a claim of such class receive or retain on account of such claim property of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed amount of such claim," \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(i), or if "the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property," \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii).</p><p>Neither condition is met here. The bank did not receive property under the reorganization plan equal to the amount of its unsecured deficiency claim. See <i>ante, </i>at 439-440.

TRUST AND SAY. ASSN. <i>v. </i>203 NORTH LASALLE STREET PARTNERSHIP</p><p>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment</p><p>received at least two forms of property under the plan: the exclusive opportunity to obtain equity, <i>ante, </i>at 454-458, and an equity interest in the reorganized entity. The plan could not be confirmed if the prepetition equity holders received any of this property "on account of" their junior interest.</p><p>The meaning of the phrase "on account of" is the central interpretive question presented by this case. This phrase obviously denotes some type of causal relationship between the junior interest and the property received or retainedsuch an interpretation comports with common understandings of the phrase. See, <i>e. </i>g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 13 (2d ed. 1987) ("by reason of," "because of"); Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 13 (1976) ("for the sake of," "by reason of," "because of"). It also tracks the use of the phrase elsewhere in the Code. See, <i>e. </i>g., 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 365(f)(3), 510(b), 1111(b)(1)(A); see generally \xc2\xa7 1129. Regardless of how direct the causal nexus must be, the prepetition equity holders here undoubtedly received at least one form of property-the exclusive opportunity-"on account of" their prepetition equity interest. <i>Ante, </i>at 454. Since \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) prohibits the prepetition equity holders from receiving "any" property under the plan on account of their junior interest, this plan was not "fair and equitable" and could not be confirmed. That conclusion, as the majority recognizes, ibid., is sufficient to resolve this case. Thus, its comments on the Government\'s position taken in another case, <i>ante, </i>at 451-454, and its speculations about the desirability of a "market test," <i>ante, </i>at 457-458, are dicta binding neither this Court nor the lower federal courts.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The majority also underestimates the need for a clear method for interpreting the Bankruptcy Code. It extensively surveys pre-Code practice and legislative history, <i>ante, </i>at 444-449, but fails to explain the relevance of these sources to the interpretive question apart from the conclu-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="461">461</a></p><p>sory assertion that the Code\'s language is "inexact" and the history is "helpful," <i>ante, </i>at 444. This sort of approach to interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code repeats a methodological error committed by this Court in <i>Dewsnup </i>v. <i>Timm, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/410/case.html">502 U. S. 410</a> (1992).</p><p>In <i>Dewsnup, </i>the Court held, based on pre-Code practice, that \xc2\xa7 506(d) of the Code prevented a Chapter 7 debtor from stripping down a creditor\'s lien on real property to the judicially determined value of the collateral. <i>Id., </i>at 419-420. The Court justified its reliance on such practice by finding the provision ambiguous. <i>I d., </i>at 416. Section 506 was ambiguous, in the Court\'s view, simply because the litigants and <i>amici </i>had offered competing interpretations of the statute. <i>Ibid. </i>This is a remarkable and untenable methodology for interpreting any statute. If litigants\' differing positions demonstrate statutory ambiguity, it is hard to imagine how any provision of the Code-or any other statute-would escape <i>Dewsnup\'s </i>broad sweep. A mere disagreement among litigants over the meaning of a statute does not prove ambiguity; it usually means that one of the litigants is simply wrong. <i>Dewsnup\'s </i>approach to statutory interpretation enables litigants to undermine the Code by creating "ambiguous" statutory language and then cramming into the Code any good idea that can be garnered from pre-Code practice or legislative history.</p><p>The risks of relying on such practice in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, which seeks to bring an entire area of law under a single, coherent statutory umbrella, are especially weighty. As we previously have recognized, the Code "was intended to modernize the bankruptcy laws, and as a result made significant changes in both the substantive and procedural laws of bankruptcy." <i>United States </i>v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/case.html">489 U. S. 235</a>, 240 (1989) (citation omitted). The Code\'s overall scheme often reflects substantial departures from various pre-Code practices. Most relevant to this case, the Code created a system of creditor class ap-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="462">462</a></p><p>462 BANK OF AMERICA NAT.

See D. Baird, The Elements of Bankruptcy 262 (rev. ed. 1993). Hence it makes little sense to graft onto the Code concepts that were developed during a quite different era of bankruptcy practice.</p><p>Even assuming the relevance of pre-Code practice in those rare instances when the Code is truly ambiguous, see, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Midlantic Nat. Bank </i>v. <i>New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/494/case.html">474 U. S. 494</a>, 501 (1986), and assuming that the language here is ambiguous, surely the sparse history behind the new value exception cannot inform the interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). No holding of this Court ever embraced the new value exception. As noted by the majority, <i>ante, </i>at 445, the leading decision suggesting this possibility, <i>Case </i>v. <i>Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/106/case.html">308 U. S. 106</a> (1939), did so in dictum. And, prior to the Code\'s enactment, no court ever relied on the <i>Case </i>dictum to approve a plan. Given its questionable pedigree prior to the Code\'s enactment, a concept developed in dictum and employed by lower federal courts only <i>after </i>the Code\'s enactment is simply not relevant to interpreting this provision of the Code.2</p><p>This danger inherent in excessive reliance on pre-Code practice did not escape the notice of the dissenting Justices in <i>Dewsnup </i>who expressed "the greatest sympathy for the Courts of Appeals who must predict which manner of statu-</p><p>2 Nor do I think that the history of rejected legislative proposals bears on the proper interpretation of the phrase "on account of." As an initial matter, such history is irrelevant for the simple reason that Congress enacted the Code, not the legislative history predating it. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Estate of Romani, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/523/517/case.html">523 U. S. 517</a>, 535-537 (1998) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Even if this history had some relevance, it would not support the view that Congress intended to insert a new value exception into the phrase "on account of." On the contrary, Congress never acted on bills that would have allowed nonmonetary new value contributions. <i>Ante, </i>at 446-447.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="463">463</a></p><p>tory construction we shall use for the next Bankruptcy Code case." <i>Dewsnup, supra, </i>at 435 (SCALIA, J., joined by SouTER, J., dissenting). Regrettably, subsequent decisions in the lower courts have borne out the dissenters\' fears. The methodological confusion created by <i>Dewsnup </i>has enshrouded both the Courts of Appeals and, even more tellingly, Bankruptcy Courts, which must interpret the Code on a daily basis.3 In the wake of <i>Dewsnup, </i>the Fifth Circuit withdrew its decision on the new value exception, prompting the author of the original opinion to observe that <i>Dewsnup </i>had clouded "[h]ow one should approach issues of a statutory construction arising from the Bankruptcy Code." <i>In re </i>Greystone III <i>Joint Venture, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/995/1274/">995 F.2d 1274</a>, 1285 <i>(CA5 1991) </i>(Jones, J., dissenting).

With only one exception, the requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1129(a) and 1129(b) are identical for plans submitted by stockholders or junior creditors and plans submitted by other parties. That exception is the requirement in \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) that no holder of a junior claim or interest may receive or retain any property "on account of such junior claim or interest."</p><p>When read in the light of Justice Douglas\' opinion in <i>Case </i>v. <i>Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/106/case.html">308 U. S. 106</a> (1939), the meaning of this provision is perfectly clear. Whenever a junior claimant receives or retains an interest for a bargain price, it does so "on account of" its prior claim.

To this end, Douglas placed special emphasis on the protection of creditors\' rights in reorganizations. Hopkirk, William O. Douglas-His Work in Policing Bankruptcy Proceedings, 18 Vand. L. Rev. 663, 685 (1965). I find it implausible that Congress, in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, intended to be even more strict than Justice Douglas in limiting the ability of debtors to participate in reorganizations.</p><p>4 "Confirmation of a plan of reorganization is the statutory goal of every chapter 11 case. Section 1129 provides the requirements for such confirmation, containing Congress\' minimum requirements for allowing an entity to discharge its unpaid debts and continue its operations." 7 Collier on Bankruptcy ~ 1129.01, p. 1129-10 (rev. 15th ed. 1998).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="466">466</a></p><p>466 BANK OF AMERICA NAT.

Any proposed cramdown must satisfy all of the requirements of \xc2\xa7 1129 including, most notably, the requirement that the plan be "fair and equitable" to all creditors whose claims are impaired. See \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(1). Moreover, even if the old stockholders propose to buy the debtor for a fair price, presumably their plan should not be approved if a third party, perhaps motivated by unique tax or competitive considerations, is willing to pay an even higher price. Cf. \xc2\xa7 1129(c).</p><p>In every reorganization case, serious questions concerning the value of the debtor\'s assets must be resolved.5 Nevertheless, for the purpose of answering the legal question presented by the parties to this case, I believe that we should assume that all valuation questions have been correctly answered. If, for example, there had been a widely advertised auction in which numerous bidders participated, and if the plan proposed by respondents had been more favorable by a wide margin than any competing proposal, would \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) require rejection of their plan simply because it provides that they shall retain 100% of the equity?</p><p>Petitioner and the Government would reply "yes" because they think \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) imposes an absolute ban on participation by junior claimants without the consent of all senior creditors.

See <i>ante, </i>at 452-453. Indeed, the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals thought "such a result would border on the absurd." 6 Thus, neither the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals nor the Court appears to be in doubt about the proper answer to my hypothetical question. Instead, the decision is apparently driven by doubts concerning the procedures followed by the Bankruptcy Judge in making his value determinations, implicitly suggesting that the statute should be construed to require some form of competitive bidding in cases like this.7 See <i>ante, </i>at 456-458.</p><p>Perhaps such a procedural requirement would be a wise addition to the statute, but it is surely not contained in the</p><p>6Judge Kanne wrote in dissent: "Perhaps the majority\'s reasoning is driven by the fear that a \'but for\' interpretation would prevent old equity from ever participating in a reorganized entity-something Congress could never have intended. Indeed, such a result would border on the absurd, but a simpler, \'but for\' causation requirement would not preclude junior interests from participating in a reorganized entity. If prior equity holders earn their shares in an open auction, for example, their received interests would not be \'on account of\' their junior interests but \'on account of\' their capital contributions." <i>In re 203 N LaSalle Street Partnership, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/126/955/">126 F.3d 955</a>, 972 (CA7 1997).</p><p>It would seem logical for adherents of this view also to find participation by junior interests in the new entity not "on account of" their prior interest, if it were stipulated that old equity\'s capital contributions exceeded the amount attainable in an auction, or if findings to that effect were not challenged.</p><p>7 This doubt is unwarranted in this case. The bank does not challenge the Bankruptcy Court\'s finding that the 15 floors of office space had a market value of $55.8 million. The bank\'s original expert testimony on the value of the property differed from the Bankruptcy Judge\'s finding by only 2.8%. <i>In re 203 N LaSalle Street Partnership, </i>190 B. R. 567, 573576 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1995). Therefore, although the bank argues that the policy implications of the "new value debate" revolve around judicial determinations of the valuation of the relevant collateral, Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 2, this concern was neither squarely presented in this case nor preserved for our review.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="468">468</a></p><p>468 BANK OF AMERICA NAT.

Indeed, that subsection is not a procedural provision at all. Section 1129 defines the substantive elements that must be met to render plans eligible for confirmation by the bankruptcy judge after all required statutory procedures have been completed. Cf. \xc2\xa7 1121 (Who may file a plan); \xc2\xa7 1122 (Classification of claims or interests); \xc2\xa7 1125 (Postpetition disclosure and solicitation); \xc2\xa7 1126 (Acceptance of plan); \xc2\xa7 1127 (Modification of plan). Because, as I discuss below, petitioner does not now challenge either the procedures followed by the Bankruptcy Judge or any of his value determinations, neither the record nor the text of \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) provides any support for the Court\'s disposition of this case.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>As I understand the Court\'s opinion, it relies on two reasons for refusing to approve the plan at this stage of the proceedings: one based on the plan itself and the other on the confirmation procedures followed before the plan was adopted. In the Court\'s view, the fatal flaw in the plan proposed by respondent was that it vested complete ownership in the former partners immediately upon confirmation, <i>ante, </i>at 454, and the defect in the process was that no other party had an opportunity to propose a competing plan.</p><p>These requirements are neither explicitly nor implicitly dictated by the text of the statute. As for the first objection, if we assume that the partners paid a fair price for what the Court characterizes as their "exclusive opportunity," I do not understand why the retention of a 100% interest in assets is any more "on account of" their prior position than retaining a lesser percentage might have been. Surely there is no legal significance to the fact that immediately after the confirmation of the plan "the partners were in the same position that they would have enjoyed had they exercised an exclusive option under the plan to buy the equity</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="469">469</a></p><p>in the reorganized entity, or contracted to purchase it from a seller who had first agreed to deal with no one else." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>As to the second objection, petitioner does not challenge the Bankruptcy Judge\'s valuation of the property or any of his other findings under \xc2\xa7 1129 (other than the plan\'s compliance with \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii)). Since there is no remaining question as to value, both the former partners (and the creditors, for that matter) are in the same position that they would have enjoyed if the Bankruptcy Court had held an auction in which this plan had been determined to be the best available. That the court did not hold such an auction should not doom this plan, because no such auction was requested by any of the parties, and the statute does not require that an auction be held. As with all the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1129, the question of compliance with \xc2\xa7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) turns on the substantive content of the plan, not on speculation about the procedures that might have preceded its confirmation.</p><p>In this case, the partners had the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan during the first 120 days after filing for bankruptcy. See \xc2\xa7 1121(b). No one contends that that exclusive right is a form of property that is retained by the debtor "on account of" its prior status.8 The partners did indeed propose a plan which provided for an infusion of $6.125 million in new capital in exchange for ownership of the reorganized debtor. Since the tax value of the partnership depended on their exclusive participation, it is unsurprising that the partners\' plan did not propose that unidentified outsiders should also be able to own an unspecified portion of the reorganized partnership. It seems both practically and economically puzzling to assume that Congress would have expected old equity to provide for the participa-</p><p>8 Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, <i>ante, </i>at 454, it is not "property" within the meaning of the Act.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="470">470</a></p><p>470 BANK OF AMERICA NAT.

They also had no assurance that the court would refuse to truncate the exclusivity period and allow other interested parties to file competing plans. As it turned out, the Bankruptcy Judge did not allow respondent to file its proposed plan, but the bank did not appeal that issue, and the question is not before us.10</p><p>The moment the judge did confirm the partners\' plan, the old equity holders were required by law to implement the terms of the planY It was then, and only then, that what</p><p>9 It goes without saying that Congress could not have expected the partners\' plan to include a provision that would allow for the Bankruptcy Judge to entertain competing plans, since that is a discretionary decision exclusively within the province of the court.

In order to flesh out all facts bearing on value, perhaps the Bankruptcy Judge should have terminated the exclusivity period and allowed the bank to file its plan. That the bank\'s plan called for liquidation of the property in a single-asset context does not necessarily contravene the purposes of Chapter 11.
