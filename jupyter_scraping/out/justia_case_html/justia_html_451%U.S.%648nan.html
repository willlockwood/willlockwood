S. 674</a></span>.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>California imposes two insurance taxes on insurance companies doing business in the State.  A premiums tax, set at a fixed percentage of premiums paid on insurance policies issued </p><p><a class="page-number" name="650">Page 451 U. S. 650</a></p><p> in the State, is imposed on both foreign and domestic insurance companies, and a "retaliatory" tax, set in response to the insurance tax laws of the insurer\'s home State, is imposed on some foreign insurance companies.  This case presents the question of the constitutionality of retaliatory taxes assessed by the State of California against appellant Western &amp; Southern Life Insurance Co., an Ohio corporation, and paid under protest for the years 1965 through 1971.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 685 of the California Insurance Code imposes a retaliatory tax on out-of-state insurers doing business in California when the insurer\'s State of incorporation imposes higher taxes on California insurers doing business in that State than California would otherwise impose on that State\'s insurers doing business in California. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In computing the retaliatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 451 U. S. 651</a></p><p> tax owed by a given out-of-state insurer, California subtracts the California taxes otherwise due from the total taxes that would be imposed on a hypothetical similar California company doing business in the out-of-state insurer\'s State of incorporation.  If the other State\'s taxes on the hypothetical California insurer would be greater than California\'s taxes on the other State\'s insurer, a retaliatory tax in the amount of the difference is imposed.  If the other State\'s taxes on the hypothetical California insurer would be less than or equal to California\'s taxes, however, California exacts no retaliatory tax from the other State\'s insurer.</p>\n<p>Western &amp; Southern, an Ohio corporation headquartered in Ohio, has engaged in the business of insurance in California since 1955.  During the years in question, the company paid a total of $977,853.57 to the State in retaliatory taxes.  After unsuccessfully filing claims for refunds with appellee Board of Equalization, Western &amp; Southern initiated this refund suit in Superior Court, arguing that California\'s retaliatory tax violates the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 451 U. S. 652</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Superior Court tried the case on stipulated facts without a jury, and ruled that the retaliatory tax is unconstitutional.  It ordered a full refund of retaliatory taxes paid, plus interest and costs.  App. 78-79.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, upholding the retaliatory tax. 99 Cal.App.3d 410, 159 Cal.Rptr. 539.  The California Supreme Court denied Western &amp; Southern\'s petition for hearing.  App. 89.  Western &amp; Southern filed a notice of appeal in this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  449 U.S. 817 (1980).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Commerce Clause provides that "The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States."  U.S.Const, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3.  In terms, the Clause is a grant of authority to Congress, not an explicit limitation on the power of the States.  In a long line of cases stretching back to the early days of the Republic, however, this Court has recognized that the Commerce Clause contains an implied limitation on the power of the States to interfere with or impose burdens on interstate commerce. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Even in the absence of congressional action, the courts may decide whether state regulations challenged under the Commerce Clause impermissibly burden interstate commerce.  <em>See, e.g., Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/456/case.html">449 U. S. 456</a></span> (1981); <em>Philadelphia v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p>Our decisions do not, however, limit the authority of <em>Congress</em> to regulate commerce among the several States as it sees fit.  In the exercise of this plenary authority, Congress may "confe[r] upon the States an ability to restrict the flow of interstate commerce that they would not otherwise enjoy."  <em>Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/27/case.html">447 U. S. 27</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/27/case.html#44">447 U. S. 44</a></span> (1980); <em>see H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

If Congress ordains that the States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 451 U.

Nevertheless, Western &amp; Southern, joined by the Solicitor General as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argues that the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not permit "anticompetitive state taxation that discriminates against out-of-state insurers."  Brief for Appellant 28; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16.  We find no such limitation in the language or history of the Act.</p>\n<p>Section 1 of the Act, 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011, contains a declaration of policy:</p>\n<p>"Congress declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States."</p>\n<p>Section 2(a), 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1012(a), declares:  "The business of insurance . . . shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business."  The unequivocal language of the Act suggests no exceptions.</p>\n<p>The McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed in the wake of <em>United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/533/case.html">322 U. S. 533</a></span> (1944), which held that insurance is "commerce" within the meaning of the Commerce Clause.  Prior to <em>South-Eastern</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 451 U. S. 654</a></p><p> <em>Underwriters,</em> insurance was not considered to be commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause, <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/231/495/case.html">231 U.

Virginia,</a></span></em> 8 Wall. 168 (1869), and thus "negative implication from the commerce clause was held not to place <em>any limitation</em> upon state power over the [insurance] business."  <em>Prudential Ins.

Believing that the business of insurance is "a local matter, to be subject to and regulated by the laws of the several States," H.R.Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1945), Congress explicitly intended the McCarran-Ferguson Act to restore state taxing and regulatory powers over the insurance business to their pre-<em>South-Eastern Underwriters</em> scope.  H.R.Rep. No. 143, <em>supra,</em> at 3; <em>see SEC v. National Securities, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/453/case.html">393 U.

The Court has squarely rejected the argument that discriminatory state insurance taxes may be challenged under the Commerce Clause despite the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  <em>Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, supra; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Hobbs,</em> 328 U.S. 822 (1946) (per curiam).  In <em>Benjamin,</em> the Court considered a South Carolina insurance premiums tax imposed solely on foreign insurance companies.  The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether the tax "would be valid in the dormancy of Congress\' power," 328 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/408/case.html#427">328 U. S. 427</a></span>, or whether the tax "would be discriminatory in the sense of an exaction forbidden by the commerce clause," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/408/case.html#429">328 U.

S. 429</a></span>, the Court held that enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act</p>\n<p>"put the full weight of [Congress\'] power behind existing and future state legislation to sustain it from any attack under the commerce clause to whatever extent this may be done with the force of that power behind it, subject only to the exceptions expressly provided for."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/408/case.html#431">328 U.

In <em>Hobbs,</em> this Court sustained against a Commerce Clause challenge a Kansas retaliatory insurance tax indistinguishable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 451 U. S. 655</a></p><p> from California\'s. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Kansas Supreme Court, upholding the retaliatory tax, had held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act "left the matter of regulation and taxation of insurance companies to the states."  <em>In re Insurance Tax Cases,</em> 160 Kan. 300, 313, 161 P.2d 726, 735 (1945).  This Court summarily affirmed, citing <em>Benjamin</em> and its companion case, <em>Robertson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/440/case.html">328 U. S. 440</a></span> (1946).  <em>Prudential Ins. Co. v. Hobbs, supra,</em> at 822. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>We must therefore reject Western &amp; Southern\'s Commerce Clause challenge to the California retaliatory tax:  the McCarran-Ferguson Act removes entirely any Commerce Clause restriction upon California\'s power to tax the insurance business.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Ordinarily, there are three provisions of the Constitution under which a taxpayer may challenge an allegedly discriminatory state tax: [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  the Commerce Clause, <em>see, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html">430 U. S. </a></span>S. 656\xef\xbf\xbd </em>Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,<em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html">430 U. S. 274</a></span> (1977); the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2, </em>see, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell,<em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/385/case.html">334 U. S. 385</a></span> (1948); and the Equal Protection Clause, </em>see, e.g., Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander,<em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/562/case.html">337 U. S. 562</a></span> (1949). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This case assumes an unusual posture, however, because the Commerce Clause is inapplicable to the business of insurance, </em>see<em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/648/case.html#652">451 U. S. </a></span> </em>supra,<em> and the Privileges and Immunities Clause is inapplicable to corporations, </em>see Hemphill v.

S. 548</a></span>-550 (1928).  Only the Equal Protection Clause remains as a possible ground for invalidation of the California tax. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment forbids the States to "deny to any person within [their] jurisdiction the equal protection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="657">Page 451 U. S. 657</a></p><p> of the laws," but does not prevent the States from making reasonable classifications among such persons.  <em>See Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/356/case.html">410 U. S. 356</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/356/case.html#359">410 U. S. 359</a></span>-360 (1973); <em>Allied Stores of Ohio v.

Thus, California\'s retaliatory insurance tax should be sustained if we find that its classification is rationally related to achievement of a legitimate state purpose.</p>\n<p>But as appellee points out, state tax provisions directed against out-of-state parties have not always been subjected to such scrutiny.  Rather, a line of Supreme Court cases most recently exemplified by <em>Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Read,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/673/case.html">325 U. S. 673</a></span> (1945), holds that a State may impose a tax on out-of-state corporations for the "privilege" of doing business in the State, without any requirement of a rational basis.  Since the California courts have defined the retaliatory tax as a "privilege" tax, <em>Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization,</em> 4 Cal.App.3d 21, 35, 84 Cal.Rptr. 88, 97-98 (1970), application of the reasoning of these cases would require us to sustain the tax without further inquiry into its rational basis.  We must therefore decide first whether California\'s retaliatory tax is subject to such further inquiry.</p>\n<p>Some past decisions of this Court have held that a State may exclude a foreign corporation from doing business or acquiring or holding property within its borders.  <em>E.g., Asbury Hospital v. Cass County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/207/case.html">326 U.

If a State cannot impose unconstitutional conditions on the grant of a privilege, then its right to withhold the privilege is less than absolute.  But if the State\'s right to withhold the privilege is absolute, then no one has the right to challenge the terms under which the State chooses to exercise that right.  In view of this tension, it is not surprising that the Court\'s attempt to accommodate both principles has produced results that seem inconsistent or illogical.  <em>Compare Dole v. Continental Ins.

Virginia, supra,</em> a case decided only 15 months after the effective date of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A Virginia statute required foreign insurance companies to purchase and file a specified amount of bonds as security for the protection of persons insured.  No such requirement was imposed on domestic insurers.  Several New York insurance companies refused to comply, and their agent was accordingly denied a license to engage in the insurance business in Virginia.  The agent was prosecuted for selling insurance without a license; he defended on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2, and the Commerce Clause. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="659">Page 451 U.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Under this view, there was no need for the Court to consider whether the statute was arbitrary, irrational, or discriminatory.</p>\n<p>"[The States] may exclude the foreign corporation entirely; they may restrict its business to particular localities, or they may exact such security for the performance of its contracts with their citizens as in their judgment will best promote the public interest.  The whole matter rests in their discretion."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>In two important respects, the legal underpinnings of <em>Paul v. Virginia</em> were soon eroded.  First, the advent of laws of general incorporation, which swept the country in the late 19th century, <em>see Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/517/case.html">288 U. S. 517</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/517/case.html#557">288 U. S. 557</a></span>-564 (1933) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), altered the very nature of the corporation.  Such laws, stimulated largely by "the desire for equality and the dread of special privilege[s]," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/517/case.html#549">288 U. S. 549</a></span>, n. 4, permitted persons to form corporations freely, subject only to generally applicable requirements and limitations.  Incorporation lost its status as a special privilege.  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="660">Page 451 U. S. 660</a></p><p> Henderson 68. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Second, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, introduced the constitutional requirement of equal protection, prohibiting the States from acting arbitrarily or treating similarly situated persons differently, <em>even with respect to privileges formerly dispensed at the State\'s discretion.</em>  The combination of general incorporation laws and equal protection necessarily undermined the doctrine of <em>Paul v. Virginia.</em>  If the right to incorporate or to do business within a State ceases to be a privilege to be dispensed by the State as it sees fit, and becomes a right generally available to all on equal terms, then the argument for special exactions as "privilege taxes" is destroyed.</p>\n<p>The Court was slow to recognize the consequences of these developments.  In <em>Philadelphia Fire Assn. v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/110/case.html">119 U. S. 110</a></span> (1886), the first relevant decision governed by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court unhesitatingly applied the doctrine of <em>Paul v. Virginia</em> to sustain a New York retaliatory insurance tax against an equal protection challenge.  The Court held that a corporation is not a "person within [the State\'s] jurisdiction," 119 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/110/case.html#116">119 U.

If it imposes such license fee as a prerequisite for the future, the foreign corporation, until it pays such license fee, is not admitted willing the State or within its jurisdiction.  It is outside, at the threshold, seeking admission, with consent not yet given. . . .

"Can it be," he asked,</p>\n<p>"that a corporation is estopped to claim the benefit of the constitutional provision securing to it the equal protection of the laws simply because it voluntarily entered and remained in a State which has enacted a statute denying such protection to it and to like corporations from the same State?"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/110/case.html#127">119 U.

At that time, franchise taxes imposed on domestic corporations were equal to privilege taxes imposed on foreign corporations.  Later, Alabama imposed an additional privilege tax on foreign corporations, which Southern Railway challenged on equal protection grounds.  The Court held that classifications among corporations for purposes of taxation are constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause only if they bear a "reasonable and just relation" to the purpose for which they are imposed.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Noting that there were domestic corporations in Alabama whose business was indistinguishable from that of Southern Railway, the Court stated that</p>\n<p>"[i]t would be a fanciful distinction to say that there is any real difference in the burden imposed because the one is taxed for the privilege of a foreign corporation to do business in the State and [the] other for the right to be a corporation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/216/400/case.html#417">216 U.

Since the amount of revenue raised by the retaliatory tax is relatively modest, <em>id.</em> at 65, and the impetus for passage of the tax comes from the nationwide insurance industry, it is clear that the purpose is not to generate revenue at the expense of out-of-state insurers, but to apply pressure on other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="670">Page 451 U. S. 670</a></p><p> States to maintain low taxes on California insurers.

V, pp. 47-48 (1972); Strickler, The Mess in State Premium Taxation of Insurance Companies, 69 Best\'s Rev. 34, 38 (1969). But the courts are not empowered to second-guess the wisdom of state policies.  <em>Ferguson v. Skrupa,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/726/case.html">372 U.

Our review is confined to the legitimacy of the purpose. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="671">Page 451 U.

This Court has recognized the legitimacy of state efforts to maintain the profit level of a domestic industry, <em>Parker v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html">317 U. S. 341</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/341/case.html#363">317 U.

California\'s effort on behalf of its domestic insurance industry is no less legitimate.</p>\n<p>The mere fact that California seeks to promote its insurance industry by influencing the policies of other States does not render the purpose illegitimate.  As we said in <em>United States Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html">434 U.

We acknowledge at the outset that many persons believe that retaliatory taxes are not an effective means for accomplishment of the goal of deterring discriminatory and excessive taxation of insurance companies by the various States.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Bodily, The Effects of Retaliation on the State Taxation of Life Insurers, 44 J. of Risk &amp; Ins. 21 (1977); Pelletier, Insurance Retaliatory Laws, 39 Notre Dame Law. 243, 268-269 (1964); Task Force Report, <em>supra,</em> at 71.  But whether, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="672">Page 451 U.

S. 154</a></span> (1938).</p>\n<p>The Interim Committee on Revenue and Taxation of the California Assembly conducted a major study of the State\'s tax system before recommending passage of a constitutional amendment permitting enforcement of the present retaliatory tax. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  That study found:</p>\n<p>"It is true that insurers are disadvantaged by retaliatory taxation provisions in the short run, for they usually result in some insurers\' paying more in taxes in retaliating states.  But, in the long run, insurers as a group pay less in taxes because of these provisions, since legislators, when considering measures affecting insurers, do consider retaliatory effects in instance after instance."</p>\n<p>Insurance Tax, at 66.  The study concluded that retaliatory taxes "have kept premiums lower and insurers\' profits higher than would otherwise have been the case."  <em>Id.</em> at 67.  It therefore recommended passage of the proposed constitutional amendment.  <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We cannot say that the California Legislature\'s conclusions were irrational, or even unreasonable.  Assuming that the lawmakers of each State are motivated in part by a desire to promote the interests of their domestic insurance industry, it is reasonable to suppose that California\'s retaliatory tax will induce other States to lower the burdens on California insurers in order to spare their domestic insurers the cost of the retaliatory tax in California. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="673">Page 451 U. S. 673</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In any event, we do not find the evidence against the retaliatory tax overwhelming.  The California Department of Finance evaluated the effect of the retaliatory laws:</p>\n<p>"Whether the insurance companies have sponsored this legislation or not, in their resistance to tax change, they have benefitted by it.  The home-owned companies in all but a half dozen states are able to say, \'Don\'t raise our taxes.  If you do, we will have to pay more in other states.\'  The effectiveness of this barrier is demonstrated by the fact that, of the 48 states, only 9 increased their insurance tax rates in the last twelve years. . . .  None of these is an outstanding insurance state."</p>\n<p>State Department of Finance, Budget Div., Highlights of Proposal for Quarterly Insurance Tax Payments 3 (1963).  The California courts examined the issue, and found:</p>\n<p>"The common purpose of [retaliatory tax] legislation in the several states has been to discourage any state from imposing discriminatory taxes or other burdens upon out-of-state companies.  The effort seems to have been very largely successful; in any event, taxes on insurance premiums have stayed close to 2 percent in most states, for both domestic and out-of-state insurers."</p>\n<p><em>Atlantic Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization,</em> 255 Cal.App.2d at 4, 62 Cal.Rptr. at 786.</p>\n<p>Authorities in the field have found the evidence mixed.  The leading empirical study of the effect of retaliatory tax laws examined tax rates on life insurance premiums from 1935 through 1972, and found:  (1) that tax rates have not increased significantly in absolute terms over the period; (2) that life insurance premiums taxes have declined as a percentage of total state tax revenues; [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] and (3) that discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="674">Page 451 U. S. 674</a></p><p> against foreign insurance companies has declined over the period.  Bodily, 44 J. of Risk &amp; Ins. at 27-32.  These results are precisely those that advocates of the retaliatory tax would predict, and thus provide some support for that theory.  Statistical analysis of the available data, however, failed to verify this conclusion:  the correlation between retaliatory tax laws and the observed results was not found to be statistically significant.  <em>Id.</em> at 30-31.  The author therefore concluded that retaliatory taxes have been "of questionable value."  <em>Id.</em> at 34.  <em>Cf.</em> Pelletier, 39 Notre Dame Law. at 267-269; Felton, Retaliatory Insurance Company Taxation:  An Evaluation, 28 J. of Ins. 71, 77-78 (1961).</p>\n<p>Parties challenging legislation under the Equal Protection Clause cannot prevail so long as</p>\n<p>"it is evident from all the considerations presented to [the legislature], and those of which we may take judicial notice, that the question is at least debatable."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

XIII, \xc2\xa7 14-4/5(f)(3) (West Supp. 1964).

The retaliatory tax is not imposed on foreign corporations <em>qua</em> foreign corporations, as would be expected were the purpose of the tax to raise revenue from noncitizens; rather, it is imposed only on corporations whose home States impose more onerous burdens on California insurers than California otherwise would impose on those corporations.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a>1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>A large part of this decline may be accounted for by the general decline in the States\' reliance on business taxes.  From 1957 to 1972, the proportion of total state tax revenues attributable to general business taxes fell by 17.7%, while the proportion attributable to life insurance premiums taxes fell by 20.0%.  Bodily, The Effects of Retaliation on the State Taxation of Life Insurers, 44 J. of Risk &amp; Ins. 21, 31-32 (1977).  <em>But see</em> State Department of Finance, Budget Div., Highlights of Proposal for Quarterly Insurance Tax Payments 3-4 (1963) (showing that, since 1950, the proportion of California tax revenues attributable to insurance taxes has decreased substantially relative to that attributable to bank and corporate taxes).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The practice of holding hostages to coerce another sovereign to change its policies is not new; nor, in my opinion, is it legitimate.  California acknowledges that its discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 451 U. S. 675</a></p><p> against Ohio citizens within its jurisdiction is specifically intended to coerce the Ohio Legislature into enacting legislation favored by California.  Today the Court holds that this state purpose is legitimate.  In my opinion, that coercive motivation is not an acceptable justification for California\'s discriminatory treatment of nonresidents.</p>\n<p>The discrimination disclosed by this record is much more irregular than a simple preference for domestic corporations over foreign corporations.  Some foreign insurance companies pay the same tax that domestic companies pay.  Those that pay higher taxes than California companies do not all pay the same tax.  Thus, for example, California taxes insurance companies incorporated in Ohio at a 2.5% rate, Montana companies at a 2.75% rate, and West Virginia and Idaho companies at a 3% rate. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The prevailing tax rate in California for domestic companies and most foreign companies is 2.3%. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Thus, the insurance companies competing in the California market are subjected to flagrant discrimination.</p>\n<p>A desire to eliminate discrimination in other States does not justify the discrimination practiced by California.  All insurance companies that do business in Ohio are taxed at the 2.5% rate, and all those that compete in the West Virginia market pay the 3% rate.  Neither of those States has meddled in California\'s affairs or taken any action that has a special impact in California.  California\'s justification for its retaliatory tax scheme is simply to apply pressure on other States to lower their tax rates to the level that California considers acceptable.  The possibility that different States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 451 U. S. 676</a></p><p> may have different fiscal needs is a matter of no concern to California. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the discrimination is not justified by any actions taken in California.  The State has not pointed to any significant difference in the way different taxpayers conduct their business in California.  No administrative problems justify charging residents of some States higher taxes than others.  The mere difference in residence is admittedly an insufficient reason for disparate treatment, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] and the incremental tax collected from out-of-state companies is not justified as a revenue measure. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Thus, the retaliatory increment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 451 U. S. 677</a></p><p> is in the nature of a monetary penalty imposed on foreign citizens to apply pressure to their sovereign.  Analytically, pressure of that kind is comparable to ransom. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no State may "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."  The federal interest vindicated by this provision requires every State to respect the individuality and the essential equality of every person subject to its jurisdiction; it forbids disparate treatment that is unrelated to any difference in the character or the behavior of persons subject to the State\'s jurisdiction.  California\'s disapproval of the official policies of the State of Ohio cannot justify the exaction of special payments from individuals who come from that State, even though such exactions may cause them to plead with their legislature to conform to California\'s will.

With respect to other states, where no discriminatory or hostile action is involved, the states are largely autonomous in these matters.  And even if another state has engaged in discriminatory action, the Constitution, as this Court has pointed out, does not contemplate the economic warfare of reprisal and retaliation.  <em>A&amp;P Tea Co. v.

This case involves the special interest of insurance companies in paying taxes at a rate no higher than the rate California requires for its budgetary purposes.  The next case may involve a different industry with a different special interest.  Thus, for example, the trucking industry or the motorcoach industry might favor high speed limits, loose safety inspection laws, and lax emission standards.  If their lobbyists could persuade the legislature of a powerful State to adopt rules favorable to their interests, then, under today\'s holding, they may also seek retaliatory programs that would apply pressure to neighboring States to adopt similar rules.  Although such a statute might violate other constitutional provisions, such as the Commerce Clause, under today\'s holding, the Equal Protection Clause would present no impediment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>In holding that California\'s purpose in enacting the discriminatory tax is legitimate, the Court compares this case to state attempts to maintain the profit level of a domestic industry, <em>Parker v.

The enactment of a statute designed to confer a direct benefit or to provide protection for domestic corporations is surely not comparable to California\'s imposition of a burden on foreign corporations designed to coerce foreign States to enact legislation which will benefit California corporations at the expense of the interest which motivated the foreign State\'s original tax rate.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
