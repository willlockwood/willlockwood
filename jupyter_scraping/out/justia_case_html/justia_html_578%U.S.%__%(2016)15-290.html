When property contains such waters, landowners who discharge pollutants without a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers risk substantial criminal and civil penalties, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71319(c), (d), while those who do apply for a permit face a process that is often arduous, expensive, and long.  It can be difficult to determine in the first place, however, whether \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d are present.

After exhausting administrative remedies, respondents sought review of the approved JD in Federal District Court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, holding that the revised JD was not a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,\xe2\x80\x9d 5  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.

A \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d JD\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, an approved JD stating that property does not contain jurisdictional waters\xe2\x80\x94creates a five-year safe harbor from civil enforcement proceedings brought by the Government and limits the potential liability a property owner faces for violating the Clean Water Act.  See 33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71319, 1365(a).  Each of those effects is a legal consequence.  It follows that an \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative\xe2\x80\x9d JD, like the one issued here, also has legal consequences: It deprives property owners of the five-year safe harbor that \xe2\x80\x9cnegative\xe2\x80\x9d JDs afford.  This conclusion tracks the \xe2\x80\x9cpragmatic\xe2\x80\x9d approach the Court has long taken to finality.  <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>v. <i>Gardner</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136\n.

The Corps contends that respondents have two such alternatives: They may proceed without a permit and argue in a Government enforcement action that a permit was not required, or they may complete the permit process and then seek judicial review, which, the Corps suggests, is what Congress envisioned.  Neither alternative is adequate.  Parties need not await enforcement proceedings before challenging final agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal and civil penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott</i>, 387 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153.  And the permitting process is not only costly and lengthy, but also irrelevant to the finality of the approved JD and its suitability for judicial review.  Furthermore, because the Clean Water Act makes no reference to standalone jurisdictional determinations, there is little basis for inferring anything from it concerning their reviewability.  Given \xe2\x80\x9cthe APA\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reviewability for all final agency action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sackett</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he mere fact\xe2\x80\x9d that permitting decisions are reviewable is insufficient to imply \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion as to other[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d agency actions, such as approved JDs, <i>Abbott</i>, 387 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141.

As noted, such a JD will generally bind the Corps for five years.  See 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C; 2005 Guidance Letter \xc2\xa71.  Under a longstanding memorandum of agreement between the Corps and EPA, it will also be \xe2\x80\x9cbinding on the Government and represent the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position in any subsequent Federal action or litigation concerning that final determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum of Agreement \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7IV\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x932, VI\xe2\x80\x93A.  A negative JD thus binds the two agencies authorized to bring civil enforcement proceedings under the Clean Water Act, see\n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71319, creating a five-year safe harbor from such proceedings for a property owner.  Additionally, although the property owner may still face a citizen suit under the Act, such a suit\xe2\x80\x94unlike actions brought by the Government\xe2\x80\x94cannot impose civil liability for wholly past violations.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71319(d), 1365(a); <i>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.</i>,\n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n\xe2\x80\x9359 (1987).  In other words, a negative JD both narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the potential liability a landowner faces for discharging pollutants without a permit.  Each of those effects is a \xe2\x80\x9clegal consequence[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d satisfying the second <i>Bennett</i> prong.  520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178; see also <i>Sackett</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It follows that affirmative JDs have legal consequences as well: They represent the denial of the safe harbor that negative JDs afford.  See\n\n5 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7551(13) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cagency action\xe2\x80\x9d to include an agency \xe2\x80\x9crule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cdenial thereof\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because \xe2\x80\x9clegal consequences . . . flow\xe2\x80\x9d from approved JDs, they constitute final agency action.  <i>Bennett</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This conclusion tracks the \xe2\x80\x9cpragmatic\xe2\x80\x9d approach we have long taken to finality.  <i>Abbott Laboratories </i>v. <i>Gardner</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 136,\n149 (1967)\n.  For example, in <i>Frozen Food Express</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n351 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40 (1956)\n, we considered the finality of an order specifying which commodities the Interstate Commerce Commission believed were exempt by statute from regulation, and which it believed were not.  Although the order \xe2\x80\x9chad no authority except to give notice of how the Commission interpreted\xe2\x80\x9d the relevant statute, and \xe2\x80\x9cwould have effect only if and when a particular action was brought against a particular carrier,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Abbott</i>, 387 U. S., at 150, we held that the order was nonetheless immediately reviewable, <i>Frozen Food</i>, 351 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  The order, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwarns every carrier, who does not have authority from the Commission to transport those commodities, that it does so at the risk of incurring criminal penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 44.  So too here, while no administrative or criminal proceeding can be brought for failure to conform to the approved JD itself, that final agency determination not only deprives respondents of a five-year safe harbor from liability under the Act, but warns that if they discharge pollutants onto their property without obtaining a permit from the Corps, they do so at the risk of significant criminal and civil penalties.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if final, an agency action is reviewable under the APA only if there are no adequate alternatives to APA review in court.\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.  The Corps contends that respondents have two such alternatives: either discharge fill material without a permit, risking an EPA enforcement action during which they can argue that no permit was required, or apply for a permit and seek judicial review if dissatisfied with the results.  Brief for Petitioner 45\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither alternative is adequate.  As we have long held, parties need not await enforcement proceedings before challenging final agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal and civil penalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott</i>, 387 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153.  If respondents discharged fill material without a permit, in the mistaken belief that their property did not contain jurisdictional waters, they would expose themselves to civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day they violated the Act, to say nothing of potential criminal liability.  See 33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71319(c), (d); <i>Sackett</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa01 (citing 74 Fed. Reg. 626, 627 (2009)).  Respondents need not assume such risks while waiting for EPA to \xe2\x80\x9cdrop the hammer\xe2\x80\x9d in order to have their day in court.  <i>Sackett</i>,<i> </i>566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor is it an adequate alternative to APA review for a landowner to apply for a permit and then seek judicial review in the event of an unfavorable decision.  As Corps officials indicated in their discussions with respondents, the permitting process can be arduous, expensive, and long.  See <i>Rapanos</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 721 (plurality opinion).  On top of the standard permit application that respondents were required to submit, see 33 CFR \xc2\xa7325.1(d) (detailing contents of permit application), the Corps demanded that they undertake, among other things, a \xe2\x80\x9chydrogeologic assessment of the rich fen system including the mineral/nutrient composition and pH of the groundwater; groundwater flow spatially and vertically; discharge and recharge areas\xe2\x80\x9d; a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional/resource assessment of the site including a vegetation survey and identification of native fen plan communities across the site\xe2\x80\x9d; an \xe2\x80\x9cinven-tory of similar wetlands in the general area (watershed), including some analysis of their quality\xe2\x80\x9d; and an \xe2\x80\x9cinven-tory of rich fen plant communities that are within sites of High and Outstanding Biodiversity Significance in the area.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  Respondents estimate that undertaking these analyses alone would cost more than $100,000.  <i>Id.,</i> at 17.  And whatever pertinence all this might have to the issuance of a permit, none of it will alter the finality of the approved JD, or affect its suitability for judicial review.  The permitting process adds nothing to the JD.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Corps nevertheless argues that Congress made the \xe2\x80\x9cevident[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d decision in the Clean Water Act that a coverage determination would be made \xe2\x80\x9cas part of the permitting process, and that the property owner would obtain any necessary judicial review of that determination at the conclusion of that process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 46.  But as the Corps acknowledges, the Clean Water Act makes no reference to standalone jurisdictional determinations, <i>ibid.</i>, so there is little basis for inferring anything from it concerning the reviewability of such distinct final agency action.  And given \xe2\x80\x9cthe APA\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reviewability for all final agency action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Sackett</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he mere fact\xe2\x80\x9d that permitting decisions are \xe2\x80\x9creviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to other[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d agency actions, such as approved JDs, <i>Abbott</i>, 387 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Sackett</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the express provision of judicial review in one section of a long and complicated statute were alone enough to overcome the APA\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of reviewability .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , it would not be much of a presumption at all\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Corps emphasizes that seeking review in an enforcement action or at the end of the permitting process would be the only available avenues for obtaining review \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the Corps had never adopted its practice of issuing standalone jurisdictional determinations upon request.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 3; see also <i>id.,</i> at 4, 23.

Even if, in an ordinary case, an agency\xe2\x80\x99s internal agreement with another agency cannot establish that its action is final, the Court is right to construe a JD as binding in light of the fact that in many instances it will have a significant bearing on whether the Clean Water Act comports with due process. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Act, especially without the JD procedure were the Government permitted to foreclose it, continues to raise troubling questions regarding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to cast doubt on the full use and enjoyment of private prop-erty throughout the Nation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
