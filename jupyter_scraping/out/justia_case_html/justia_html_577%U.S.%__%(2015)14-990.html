The prior statute had provided: \xe2\x80\x9cThe district judge to whom the application for injunction or other relief is presented shall constitute one member of [the three-judge] court.  On the filing of the application, he shall immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges\xe2\x80\x9d to serve.\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(1) (1970 ed.).

The dispute here concerns the scope of the italicized text.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In response to the 2010 Census, Maryland enacted a statute in October 2011 establishing\xe2\x80\x94or, more pejora-tively, gerrymandering\xe2\x80\x94the districts for the State\xe2\x80\x99s eight congressional seats.  Dissatisfied with the crazy-quilt results, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a, petitioners, a bipartisan group of citizens, filed suit <i>pro\xc2\xa0se</i> in Federal District Court.  Their amended complaint alleges, <i>inter alia</i>, that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting plan burdens their\n \nFirst Amendment right of political association.  Petitioners also requested that a three-judge court be convened to hear the case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Judge, however, thought the claim \xe2\x80\x9cnot one for which relief can be granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Benisek</i> v. <i>Mack</i>, 11 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 516, 526 (Md. 2014).  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing about the congressional districts at issue in this case affects in any proscribed way [petitioners\xe2\x80\x99] ability to participate in the political debate in any of the Maryland congressional districts in which they might find themselves.  They are free to join preexisting political committees, form new ones, or use whatever other means are at their disposal to influence the opinions of their congressional representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For that reason, instead of notifying the Chief Judge of the Circuit of the need for a three-judge court, the District Judge dismissed the action.  The Fourth Circuit summar-ily affirmed in an unpublished disposition.  <i>Benisek</i> v. <i>Mack</i>, 584 Fed. Appx. 140 (CA4 2014).  Seeking review in this Court, petitioners pointed out that at least two other Circuits consider it reversible error for a district judge to dismiss a case under \xc2\xa72284 for failure to state a claim for relief rather than refer it for transfer to a three-judge court.  See <i>LaRouche</i> v. <i>Fowler</i>, 152 F.\xc2\xa03d 974, 981\xe2\x80\x93983 (CADC 1998); <i>LULAC</i> v. <i>Texas</i>, 113 F.\xc2\xa03d 53, 55\xe2\x80\x9356 (CA5 1997) (<i>per curiam</i>).

Not so, argue respondents; the 1976 addition to \xc2\xa72284(b)(1) of the clause \xe2\x80\x9cunless he determines that three judges are not required\xe2\x80\x9d is precisely such a grant of authority.  Moreover, say respondents, Congress declined to specify a standard to constrain the exercise of this authority.  Choosing, as the District Judge did, the familiar standard for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) best serves the purposes of a three-judge court, which (in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view) is to protect States from \xe2\x80\x9chasty, imprudent invalidation\xe2\x80\x9d of their statutes by rogue district judges acting alone.  Brief for Respondents 27.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whatever the purposes of a three-judge court may be, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument needlessly produces a contradiction in the statutory text.  That text\xe2\x80\x99s initial prescription could not be clearer: \xe2\x80\x9cA district court of three judges <i>shall be convened</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284(a) (emphasis added).  Nobody disputes that the present suit is \xe2\x80\x9can action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  It follows that the district judge was <i>required</i> to refer the case to a three-judge court, for \xc2\xa72284(a) admits of no exception, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe mandatory \xe2\x80\x98shall\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26,\n35 (1998)\n; see also <i>National Assn. of Home Builders</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644\n\xe2\x80\x93662 (2007) (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The subsequent provision of \xc2\xa72284(b)(1), that the district judge shall commence the process for appointment of a three-judge panel \xe2\x80\x9cunless he determines that three judges are not required,\xe2\x80\x9d need not and therefore should not be read as a grant of discretion to the district judge to ignore \xc2\xa72284(a).  It is not even framed as a proviso, or an exception from that provision, but rather as an administrative detail that is entirely compatible with \xc2\xa72284(a).  The old \xc2\xa72284(1) triggered the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s duty to refer the matter for the convening of a three-judge court \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n the filing of the application\xe2\x80\x9d to enjoin an unconstitutional state law.  By contrast, the current \xc2\xa72284(b)(1) triggers the district judge\xe2\x80\x99s duty \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon the filing of a <i>request</i> for three judges\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  But of course a party may\xe2\x80\x94whether in good faith or bad, through ignorance or hope or malice\xe2\x80\x94file a <i>request</i> for a three-judge court even if the case does not merit one under \xc2\xa72284(a).  Section 2284(b)(1) merely clarifies that a district judge need not unthinkingly initiate the procedures to convene a three-judge court without first examining the allegations in the complaint.  In short, all the district judge must \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[e]\xe2\x80\x9d is whether the \xe2\x80\x9crequest for three judges\xe2\x80\x9d is made in a case covered by \xc2\xa72284(a)\xe2\x80\x94no more, no less.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That conclusion is bolstered by \xc2\xa72284(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s explicit command that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] single judge shall not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. enter judgment on the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  It would be an odd interpretation that allowed a district judge to do under \xc2\xa72284(b)(1) what he is forbidden to do under \xc2\xa72284(b)(3).  More likely that Congress intended a three-judge court, and not a single district judge, to enter all final judgments in cases satisfying the criteria of \xc2\xa72284(a).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondents argue in the alternative that a district judge is not required to refer a case for the convening of a three-judge court if the constitutional claim is (as they assert petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim to be) \xe2\x80\x9cinsubstantial.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Goosby</i> v. <i>Osser</i>,\n\n409 U.\xc2\xa0S. 512 (1973)\n, we stated that the filing of a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally insubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d claim did not trigger the three-judge-court requirement under the pre-1976 statu-tory regime.  <i>Id</i>., at 518.  <i>Goosby</i> rested not on an interpretation of statutory text, but on the familiar proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the absence of diversity of citizenship, it is essential to jurisdiction that a <i>substantial</i> federal question should be presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Poresky</i>,\n\n290 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30,\n31 (1933)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (emphasis added).  Absent a substantial federal question, even a single-judge district court lacks jurisdiction, and \xe2\x80\x9c[a] three-judge court is not required where the district court itself lacks jurisdiction of the complaint or the complaint is not justiciable in the federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzalez</i> v. <i>Automatic Employees Credit Union</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 90,\n100 (1974)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the present case, however, the District Judge dismissed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint not because he thought he lacked jurisdiction, but because he concluded that the allegations failed to state a claim for relief on the merits, citing <i>Ashcroft</i> v. <i>Iqbal</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662 (2009)\n, and <i>Bell Atlantic Corp.</i> v. <i>Twombly</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 544 (2007)\n.  See 11 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 520.  That was in accord with Fourth Circuit precedent, which holds that where the \xe2\x80\x9cpleadings do not state a claim, then <i>by definition they are insubstantial</i> and so properly are subject to dismissal by the district court without convening a three-judge court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Duckworth</i> v. <i>State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws</i>, 332 F.\xc2\xa03d 769, 772\xe2\x80\x93773 (CA4 2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We think this standard both too demanding and inconsistent with our precedents.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]onstitutional claims will not lightly be found insubstantial for purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d the three-judge-court statute.  <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134\n\xe2\x80\x93148 (1980).  We have long distinguished between failing to raise a substantial federal question for jurisdictional purposes\xe2\x80\x94which is what <i>Goosby</i> addressed\xe2\x80\x94and failing to state a claim for relief on the merits; only \xe2\x80\x9cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\xe2\x80\x9d claims implicate the former.  <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Hood</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 678\n\xe2\x80\x93683 (1946); see also <i>Hannis Distilling Co.</i> v. <i>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore</i>,\n\n216 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285,\n288 (1910)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cobviously frivolous or plainly insubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Patterson</i>,\n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 31,\n33 (1962)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cwholly insubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clegally speaking non-existent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cessentially fictitious\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83,\n89 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous or immaterial\xe2\x80\x9d).

Consistent with this principle, <i>Goosby</i> clarified that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]onstitutional insubstantiality\xe2\x80\x99 for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as \xe2\x80\x98essen-tially fictitious,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98wholly insubstantial,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98obviously frivolous,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98obviously without merit.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 518 (citations omitted).

Although the <i>Vieth</i> plurality thought all political gerrymandering claims nonjusticiable, Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment, surmised that if \xe2\x80\x9ca State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a\n \nFirst Amendment violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the\n \nFirst Amendment may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Vieth</i> v. <i>Jubelirer</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267,\n315 (2004)\n.  Whatever \xe2\x80\x9cwholly insubstantial,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cobviously frivolous,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., mean, at a minimum they cannot include a plea for relief based on a legal theory put forward by a Justice of this Court and uncontradicted by the majority in any of our cases.
