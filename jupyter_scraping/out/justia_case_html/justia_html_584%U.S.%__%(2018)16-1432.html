In 2002, Minnesota enacted a statute establishing one such default rule.  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe dissolution or annulment of a marriage revokes any revocable .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. beneficiary designation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made by an individual to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s former spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7524.2\xe2\x80\x93804, subd. 1.  Under the statute, if one spouse has made the other the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or similar asset, their divorce automatically revokes that designation so that the insurance proceeds will instead go to the contingent beneficiary or the policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s estate upon his death.  The law does this on the theory that the policyholder would want that result.  But if he does not, he may rename the ex-spouse as beneficiary.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Mark Sveen and respondent Kaye Melin were married in 1997.  The next year, Sveen purchased a life insurance policy, naming Melin as the primary beneficiary and designating his two children from a prior marriage, petitioners Ashley and Antone Sveen, as contingent beneficiaries.  The Sveen-Melin marriage ended in 2007, but the divorce decree made no mention of the insurance policy and Sveen took no action to revise his beneficiary designations.  After Sveen passed away in 2011, Melin and the Sveen children made competing claims to the insurance proceeds.  The Sveens argued that under Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s revocation-on-divorce law, their father\xe2\x80\x99s divorce canceled Melin\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary designation, leaving them as the rightful recipients.  Melin claimed that because the law did not exist when the policy was purchased and she was named as the primary beneficiary, applying the later-enacted law to the policy violates the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Contracts Clause.  The District Court awarded the insurance money to the Sveens, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the retroactive application of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law violates the Contracts Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The retroactive application of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s statute does not violate the Contracts Clause.  That Clause restricts the power of States to disrupt contractual arrangements, but it does not prohibit all laws affecting pre-existing contracts, see <i>El Paso</i> v. <i>Simmons,</i>\n\n379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497, 506\xe2\x80\x93507.  The two-step test for determining when such a law crosses the constitutional line first asks whether the state law has \xe2\x80\x9coperated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allied Structural Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Spannaus,</i>\n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, 244.  In answering that question, the Court has considered the extent to which the law undermines the contractual bargain, interferes with a party\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectations, and prevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his rights.  See <i>id., </i>at 246; <i>El Paso</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 514\xe2\x80\x93515; <i>Texaco, Inc.</i> v. <i>Short,</i>\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516, 531.  If such factors show a substantial impairment, the inquiry turns to whether the state law is drawn in an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d way to advance \xe2\x80\x9ca significant and legitimate public purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Energy Reserves Group, Inc.</i> v. <i>Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.,</i>\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 411\xe2\x80\x93412.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Court stops after the first step here, because three aspects of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law, taken together, show that the law does not substantially impair pre-existing contractual arrangements.  First, the law is designed to reflect a policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s intent\xe2\x80\x94and so to support, rather than impair, the contractual scheme. It applies a prevalent legislative presumption that a divorcee would not want his former partner to benefit from his life insurance policy and other will substitutes.  Thus the law often honors, not undermines, the intent of the only contracting party to care about the beneficiary term.  Second, the law is unlikely to disturb any policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s expectations at the time of contracting, because an insured cannot reasonably rely on a beneficiary designation staying in place after a divorce.  Divorce courts have wide discretion to divide property upon dissolution of a marriage, including by revoking spousal beneficiary designations in life insurance policies or by mandating that such designations remain.  Because a life insurance purchaser cannot know what will happen to that policy in the event of a divorce, his reliance interests are next to nil.  And that fact cuts against providing protection under the Contracts Clause.  Last, the law supplies a mere default rule, which the policyholder can undo in a moment.  If the law\xe2\x80\x99s presumption about what an insured wants after divorcing is wrong, the insured may overthrow it simply by sending a change-of-beneficiary form to his insurer.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This Court has long held that laws imposing such minimal paperwork burdens do not violate the Contracts Clause.  It has repeatedly sustained so-called recording statutes, which extinguish contractual interests unless timely recorded at government offices.  See <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Lamphire</i>, 3 Pet. 280; <i>Vance</i> v. <i>Vance,</i>\n\n108 U.\xc2\xa0S. 514; <i>Texaco, Inc.</i> v. <i>Short,</i>\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516.  The Court has also upheld laws mandating other kinds of notifications or filings against Contracts Clause attack.  See <i>Curtis</i> v. <i>Whitney,</i> 13 Wall. 68; <i>Gilfillan</i> v. <i>Union Canal Co. of Pa.,</i>\n\n109 U.\xc2\xa0S. 401; <i>Conley</i> v. <i>Barton,</i>\n\n260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677.  The Minnesota law places no greater obligation on a contracting party than these laws\xe2\x80\x94while imposing a lesser penalty for noncompliance.  Filing a change-of-beneficiary form is as easy as satisfying the paperwork requirements that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases approved.  And if an insured wants his ex-spouse to stay as beneficiary but does not send in his form, the result is only that the insurance money is redirected to his contingent beneficiaries, not that his contractual rights are extinguished.

Stat. \xc2\xa7524.2\xe2\x80\x93804, subd. 1 (2016).  That statute establishes a default rule for use when Minnesotans divorce.  If one spouse has made the other the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or similar asset, their divorce automatically revokes that designation\xe2\x80\x94on the theory that the policyholder would want that result.  But if he does not, the policyholder may rename the ex-spouse as beneficiary.</p><p>We consider here whether applying Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s automatic-revocation rule to a beneficiary designation made before the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment violates the Contracts Clause of the Constitution.  We hold it does not.</p><p>I</p><p>All good trust-and-estate lawyers know that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eath is not the end; there remains the litigation over the estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce 365 (1911).  That epigram, beyond presaging this case, helps explain the statute at its center.</p><p>The legal system has long used default rules to resolve estate litigation in a way that conforms to decedents\xe2\x80\x99 presumed intent.  At common law, for example, marriage automatically revoked a woman\xe2\x80\x99s prior will, while marriage <i>and </i>the birth of a child revoked a man\xe2\x80\x99s.  See 4 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 507, 512 (1830).  The testator could then revive the old will or execute a new one.  But if he (or she) did neither, the laws of intestate succession (generally prioritizing children and current spouses) would control the estate\xe2\x80\x99s distribution.  See 95 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Wills \xc2\xa7448, pp. 409\xe2\x80\x93410 (2011); R. Sitkoff &amp; J. Dukeminier, Wills, Trusts, and Estates 63 (10th ed. 2017).  Courts reasoned that the average person would prefer that allocation to the one in the old will, given the intervening life events.  See T. Atkinson, Handbook of the Law of Wills 423 (2d ed. 1953).  If he\xe2\x80\x99d only had the time, the thought went, he would have replaced that will himself.</p><p>Changes in society brought about changes in the laws governing revocation of wills.  In addition to removing gender distinctions, most States abandoned the common-law rule canceling whole wills executed before a marriage or birth.  In its place, they enacted statutes giving a new spouse or child a specified share of the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate while leaving the rest of his will intact.  See Sitkoff &amp; Dukeminier, Wills, Trusts, and Estates, at 240.  But more important for our purposes, climbing divorce rates led almost all States by the 1980s to adopt another kind of automatic-revocation law.  So-called revocation-on-divorce statutes treat an individual\xe2\x80\x99s divorce as voiding a testamentary bequest to a former spouse.  Like the old common-law rule, those laws rest on a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment about the typical testator\xe2\x80\x99s probable intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 239.  They presume, in other words, that the average Joe does not want his ex inheriting what he leaves behind.</p><p>Over time, many States extended their revocation-on-divorce statutes from wills to \xe2\x80\x9cwill substitutes,\xe2\x80\x9d such as revocable trusts, pension accounts, and life insurance policies.  See Langbein, The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, 97 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1108, 1109 (1984) (describing nonprobate assets).  In doing so, States followed the lead of the Uniform Probate Code, a model statute amended in 1990 to include a provision revoking on divorce not just testamentary bequests but also beneficiary designations to a former spouse.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93804(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0A. 330, 330\xe2\x80\x93331 (2013).  The new section, the drafters wrote, aimed to \xe2\x80\x9cunify the law of probate and nonprobate transfers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93804, Comment, <i>id</i>., at 333.  The underlying idea was that the typical decedent would no more want his former spouse to benefit from his pension plan or life insurance than to inherit under his will.  A wealth transfer was a wealth transfer\xe2\x80\x94and a former spouse (as compared with, say, a current spouse or child) was not likely to be its desired recipient.  So a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s failure to change his beneficiary probably resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cinattention,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cintention.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement of the Joint Editorial Bd. for Uniform Probate Code, 17 Am. College Trust &amp; Est. Counsel 184 (1991).  Agreeing with that assumption, 26 States have by now adopted revocation-on-divorce laws substantially similar to the Code\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  Minnesota is one.</p><p>Under prior Minnesota law, a divorce alone did not affect a beneficiary designation\xe2\x80\x94but a particular divorce decree could do so.  Take first the simple case: Joe names his wife Ann as beneficiary of his insurance policy, later gets divorced, but never changes the designation.  Upon his death, Ann would receive the insurance proceeds\xe2\x80\x94even if Joe had just forgotten to redirect the money.  In other words, the insurance contract\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary provision would govern after the divorce, exactly as it would have before.  See <i>Larsen </i>v. <i>Northwestern Nat. Life Ins. Co.</i>, 463 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 777, 779 (Minn. App. 1990).<i> </i>But now introduce a complication, in the form of a court addressing a spousal designation in a divorce decree.  In Minnesota, as across the nation, divorce courts have always had \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion in dividing property upon dissolution of a marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maurer</i> v. <i>Maurer</i>, 623 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 604, 606 (Minn. 2001); see 24 Am. Jur. 2d, Divorce and Separation \xc2\xa7456 (2008).  In exercising that power, a court could revoke a beneficiary designation to a soon-to-be ex-spouse; or conversely, a court could mandate that the old designation remain.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Paul</i>, 410 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 329, 330 (Minn. App. 1987); <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i> v. <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i>, 343 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 850, 853 (Minn. 1984).  Either way, the court, rather than the insured, would decide whether the ex-spouse would stay the beneficiary.</p><p>In contrast to the old law, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s new revocation-on-divorce statute starts from another baseline: the cancellation, rather than continuation, of a beneficiary designation.  Enacted in 2002 to track the Code, the law provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe dissolution or annulment of a marriage revokes any revocable[\xc2\xa0] disposition, beneficiary designation, or appointment of property made by an individual to the individual\xe2\x80\x99s former spouse in a governing instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7524.2\xe2\x80\x93804, subd. 1.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning instrument\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to include an \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance or annuity policy,\xe2\x80\x9d along with a will and other will substitutes.  \xc2\xa7524.1\xe2\x80\x93201.  So now when Joe and Ann divorce, the clause naming Ann as Joe\xe2\x80\x99s insurance beneficiary is automatically revoked.  If nothing else occurs before Joe\xe2\x80\x99s death, his insurance proceeds go to any contingent beneficiary named in the policy (perhaps his daughter Emma) or, failing that, to his estate.  See \xc2\xa7524.2\xe2\x80\x93804, subd. 2.</p><p>Something else, however, may well happen.  As under Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s former law, a divorce decree may alter the natural state of things.  So in our example, the court could direct that Ann remain as Joe\xe2\x80\x99s insurance beneficiary, despite the normal revocation rule.  See \xc2\xa7524.2\xe2\x80\x93804, subd. 1 (providing that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt order\xe2\x80\x9d trumps the rule).  And just as important, the policyholder himself may step in to override the revocation.  Joe, for example, could agree to a marital settlement ensuring Ann\xe2\x80\x99s continued status as his beneficiary.  See <i>ibid. </i>(providing that such an agreement controls).<i> </i>Or else, and more simply, he could notify his insurance company at any time that he wishes to restore Ann to that position.</p><p>But enough of our hypothetical divorcees: It is time they give way to Mark Sveen and Kaye Melin, whose marriage and divorce led to this case.  In 1997, Sveen and Melin wed.  The next year, Sveen purchased a life insurance policy.  He named Melin as the primary beneficiary, while designating his two children from a prior marriage, Ashley and Antone Sveen, as the contingent beneficiaries.  The Sveen-Melin marriage ended in 2007.  The divorce decree made no mention of the insurance policy.  And Sveen took no action, then or later, to revise his beneficiary designations.  In 2011, he passed away.</p><p>In this action, petitioners the Sveen children and respondent Melin make competing claims to the insurance proceeds.  The Sveens contend that under Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s revocation-on-divorce law, their father\xe2\x80\x99s divorce canceled Melin\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary designation and left the two of them as the rightful recipients.  Melin notes in reply that the Minnesota law did not yet exist when her former husband bought his insurance policy and named her as the primary beneficiary.  And she argues that applying the later-enacted law to the policy would violate the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Contracts Clause, which prohibits any state \xe2\x80\x9cLaw impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa01.</p><p>The District Court rejected Melin\xe2\x80\x99s argument and awarded the insurance money to the Sveens.  See Civ. No. 14\xe2\x80\x935015 (D Minn., Jan. 7, 2016), App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a\xe2\x80\x9316a.  But the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.  It held that a \xe2\x80\x9crevocation-upon-divorce statute like [Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s] violates the Contract Clause when applied retroactively.\xe2\x80\x9d  853 F.\xc2\xa03d 410, 412 (2017).</p><p>We granted certiorari, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), to resolve a split of authority over whether the Contracts Clause prevents a revocation-on-divorce law from applying to a pre-existing agreement\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary designation.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  We now reverse the decision below.</p><p>II</p><p>The Contracts Clause restricts the power of States to disrupt contractual arrangements.  It provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o state shall .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pass any .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl. 1.  The origins of the Clause lie in legislation enacted after the Revolutionary War to relieve debtors of their obligations to creditors.  See <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn.</i> v. <i>DeBenedictis</i>,480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 470, 502\xe2\x80\x93503 (1987).  But the Clause applies to any kind of contract.  See <i>Allied Structural Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Spannaus</i>,438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, 244\xe2\x80\x93245, n. 16 (1978).  That includes, as here, an insurance policy.</p><p>At the same time, not all laws affecting pre-existing contracts violate the Clause.  See <i>El Paso</i> v. <i>Simmons</i>,379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497, 506\xe2\x80\x93507 (1965).  To determine when such a law crosses the constitutional line, this Court has long applied a two-step test.  The threshold issue is whether the state law has \xe2\x80\x9coperated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Allied Structural Steel Co.</i>, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 244.  In answering that question, the Court has considered the extent to which the law undermines the contractual bargain, interferes with a party\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectations, and prevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his rights.  See <i>id.,</i> at 246; <i>El Paso</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 514\xe2\x80\x93515; <i>Texaco, Inc.</i> v. <i>Short</i>,454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516, 531 (1982).  If such factors show a substantial impairment, the inquiry turns to the means and ends of the legislation.  In particular, the Court has asked whether the state law is drawn in an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d way to advance \xe2\x80\x9ca significant and legitimate public purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Energy Reserves Group, Inc.</i> v. <i>Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.</i>,459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 411\xe2\x80\x93412 (1983).</p><p>Here, we may stop after step one because Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s revocation-on-divorce statute does not substantially impair pre-existing contractual arrangements.  True enough that in revoking a beneficiary designation, the law makes a significant change.  As Melin says, the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole point\xe2\x80\x9d of buying life insurance is to provide the proceeds to the named beneficiary.  Brief for Respondent 16.  But three aspects of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law, taken together, defeat Melin\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the change it effected \xe2\x80\x9cseverely impaired\xe2\x80\x9d her ex-husband\xe2\x80\x99s contract.  <i>Ibid</i>.  First, the statute is designed to reflect a policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s intent\xe2\x80\x94and so to support, rather than impair, the contractual scheme.  Second, the law is unlikely to disturb any policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s expectations because it does no more than a divorce court could always have done.  And third, the statute supplies a mere default rule, which the policyholder can undo in a moment.  Indeed, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s revocation statute stacks up well against laws that this Court upheld against Contracts Clause challenges as far back as the early 1800s.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  We now consider in detail each of the features that make this so.</p><p>To begin, the Minnesota statute furthers the policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s intent in many cases\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the drafters reasonably thought in the typical one.  As earlier described, legislatures have long made judgments about a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s likely testamentary intent after large life changes\xe2\x80\x94a marriage, a birth, or a divorce.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And on that basis, they have long enacted statutes revoking earlier-made wills by operation of law.  Legislative presumptions about divorce are now especially prevalent\xe2\x80\x94probably because they accurately reflect the intent of most divorcing parties.  Although there are exceptions, most divorcees do not aspire to enrich their former partners.  (And that is true even when an ex-spouse has custody of shared children, given the many ways to provide them with independent support.)  The Minnesota statute (like the model code it tracked) applies that understanding to beneficiary designations in life insurance policies and other will substitutes.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x935.  Melin rightly notes that this extension raises a brand-new constitutional question because \xe2\x80\x9can insurance policy is a contract under the Contracts Clause, and a will is not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But in answering that question, it matters that the old legislative presumption equally fits the new context: A person would as little want his ex-spouse to benefit from his insurance as to collect under his will.  Or said otherwise, the insured\xe2\x80\x99s failure to change the beneficiary after a divorce is more likely the result of neglect than choice.  And that means the Minnesota statute often honors, not undermines, the intent of the only contracting party to care about the beneficiary term.  The law no doubt changes how the insurance contract operates.  But does it impair the contract?  Quite the opposite for lots of policyholders.</p><p>And even when presumed and actual intent diverge, the Minnesota law is unlikely to upset a policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s expectations at the time of contracting.  That is because an insured cannot reasonably rely on a beneficiary designation remaining in place after a divorce.  As noted above, divorce courts have wide discretion to divide property between spouses when a marriage ends.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  The house, the cars, the sporting equipment are all up for grabs.  See Judgment and Decree in 14\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x935015 (D Minn.), p. 51 (awarding Melin, among other things, a snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle).  And (what matters here) so too are the spouses\xe2\x80\x99 life insurance policies, with their beneficiary provisions.  Although not part of the Sveen-Melin divorce decree, they could have been; as Melin acknowledges, they sometimes are.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4; Brief for Respondent 38.  Melin counters that the Contracts Clause applies only to legislation, not to judicial decisions.  See <i>id.,</i> at 38\xe2\x80\x9339; see also <i>post</i>, at 9 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  That is true, but of no moment.  The power of divorce courts over insurance policies is relevant here because it affects whether a party can reasonably expect a beneficiary designation to survive a marital breakdown.  We venture to guess that few people, when purchasing life insurance, give a thought to what will happen in the event of divorce.  But even if someone out there does, he can conclude only that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. he cannot possibly know.  So his reliance interests are next to nil.  And as this Court has held before, that fact cuts against providing protection under the Contracts Clause.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>El Paso</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 514\xe2\x80\x93515.</p><p>Finally, a policyholder can reverse the effect of the Minnesota statute with the stroke of a pen.  The law puts in place a presumption about what an insured wants after divorcing.  But if the presumption is wrong, the insured may overthrow it.  And he may do so by the simple act of sending a change-of-beneficiary form to his insurer.  (Or if he wants to commit himself forever, like Ulysses binding himself to the mast, he may agree to a divorce settlement continuing his ex-spouse\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary status.  See <i>supra</i>, at 5.)  That action restores his former spouse to the position she held before the divorce\xe2\x80\x94and in so doing, cancels the state law\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  The statute thus reduces to a paperwork requirement (and a fairly painless one, at that): File a form and the statutory default rule gives way to the original beneficiary designation.</p><p>In cases going back to the 1800s, this Court has held that laws imposing such minimal paperwork burdens do not violate the Contracts Clause.  One set of decisions addresses so-called recording statutes, which extinguish contractual interests unless timely recorded at government offices.  In <i>Jackson </i>v.<i> Lamphire</i>, 3 Pet. 280 (1830), for example, the Court rejected a Contracts Clause challenge to a New York law granting title in property to a later rather than earlier purchaser whenever the earlier had failed to record his deed.  It made no difference, the Court held, whether the unrecorded deed was \xe2\x80\x9cdated before or after the passage\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute; in neither event did the law\xe2\x80\x99s modest recording condition \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[\xc2\xa0] the obligation of contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 290.  Likewise, in <i>Vance</i> v. <i>Vance</i>,108 U.\xc2\xa0S. 514 (1883), the Court upheld a statute rendering unrecorded mortgages unenforceable against third parties\xe2\x80\x94even when the mortgages predated the law.  We reasoned that the law gave \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard to existing contracts\xe2\x80\x9d because it demanded only that the mortgagee make a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic registration,\xe2\x80\x9d and gave him several months to do so.  <i>Id.,</i> at 517, 518.  And more recently, in <i>Texaco, Inc.</i> v. <i>Short</i>,454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516 (1982), the Court held that a statute terminating pre-existing mineral interests unless the owner filed a \xe2\x80\x9cstatement of claim\xe2\x80\x9d in a county office did not \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutionally impair\xe2\x80\x9d a contract.  <i>Id.,</i> at 531.  The filing requirement was \xe2\x80\x9cminimal,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, and compliance with it would effectively \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard any contractual obligations or rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>So too, the Court has long upheld against Contracts Clause attack laws mandating other kinds of notifications or filings.  In <i>Curtis</i> v. <i>Whitney</i>, 13 Wall. 68 (1872), for example, the Court approved a statute retroactively affecting buyers of \xe2\x80\x9ccertificates\xe2\x80\x9d for land offered at tax sales.  The law required the buyer to notify the tax-delinquent property owner, who could then put up the funds necessary to prevent the land\xe2\x80\x99s final sale.  If the buyer failed to give the notice, he could not take the land\xe2\x80\x94and if he provided the notice, his chance of gaining the land declined.  Still, the Court made short work of the Contracts Clause claim.  Not \xe2\x80\x9cevery statute which affects the value of a contract,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[s] its obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 70.  Because the law\xe2\x80\x99s notice rule was \xe2\x80\x9ceasy [to] compl[y] with,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not raise a constitutional problem.  <i>Id.,</i> at 71.  Similarly, in <i>Gilfillan</i> v. <i>Union Canal Co. of Pa.</i>,109 U.\xc2\xa0S. 401 (1883), the Court sustained a state law providing that an existing bondholder\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reject a settlement proposal in writing would count as consent to the deal.  The law operated to reduce the interest received by an investor who did not respond.  Yet the Court rebuffed the ensuing Contracts Clause suit.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf [the bondholder did] not wish to abandon his old rights and accept the new,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9call he ha[d] to do [was] to say so in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 406.  And one last: In <i>Conley</i> v. <i>Barton</i>,260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677 (1923), the Court held that the Contracts Clause did not bar a State from compelling existing mortgagees to complete affidavits before finally foreclosing on properties.  The law effectively added a paperwork requirement to the mortgage contracts\xe2\x80\x99 foreclosure terms.  But the Court said<i> </i>it was \xe2\x80\x9conly [a] condition, easily complied with, which the law, for its purposes, requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 681.</p><p>The Minnesota statute places no greater obligation on a contracting party\xe2\x80\x94while imposing a lesser penalty for noncompliance.  Even supposing an insured wants his life insurance to benefit his ex-spouse, filing a change-of-beneficiary form with an insurance company is as \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d as, say, providing a landowner with notice or recording a deed.  <i>Curtis</i>, 13 Wall., at 71.<i> </i>Here too, with only \xe2\x80\x9cminimal\xe2\x80\x9d effort, a person can \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard\xe2\x80\x9d his contractual preferences.  <i>Texaco</i>, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531.  And here too, if he does not \xe2\x80\x9cwish to abandon his old rights and accept the new,\xe2\x80\x9d he need only \xe2\x80\x9csay so in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gilfillan, </i>109 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 406.  What\xe2\x80\x99s more, if the worst happens\xe2\x80\x94if he wants his ex-spouse to stay as beneficiary but does not send in his form\xe2\x80\x94the consequence pales in comparison with the losses incurred in our earlier cases.  When a person ignored a recording obligation, for example, he could forfeit the sum total of his contractual rights\xe2\x80\x94just ask the plaintiffs in <i>Jackson </i>and <i>Vance.  </i>But when a policyholder in Minnesota does not redesignate his ex-spouse as beneficiary, his right to insurance does not lapse; the upshot is just that his contingent beneficiaries (here, his children) receive the money.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.  That redirection of proceeds is not nothing; but under our precedents, it gives the policyholder\xe2\x80\x94who, again, could have \xe2\x80\x9ceasily\xe2\x80\x9d and entirely escaped the law\xe2\x80\x99s effect\xe2\x80\x94no right to complain of a Contracts Clause violation.  <i>Conley</i>, 260 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 681.</p><p>In addressing those precedents, Melin mainly urges us to distinguish between two ways a law can affect a contract.  The Minnesota law, Melin claims, \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] on the contract itself\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly chang[ing] an express term\xe2\x80\x9d (the insured\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary designation).  Brief for Respondent 51; Tr. of Oral Arg. 57.  In contrast, Melin continues, the recording statutes \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[\xc2\xa0] a consequence\xe2\x80\x9d for failing to abide by a \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d obligation extraneous to the agreement (the State\xe2\x80\x99s recording or notification rule).  Brief for Respondent 51; Tr. of Oral Arg. 58.  The difference, in her view, parallels the line between rights and remedies: The Minnesota law explicitly alters a person\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement under the contract, while the recording laws interfere with his ability to enforce that entitlement against others.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9359; see also <i>post</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).</p><p>But we see no meaningful distinction among all these laws.  The old statutes also \xe2\x80\x9cact[ed] on the contract\xe2\x80\x9d in a significant way.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 59.  They added a paperwork obligation nowhere found in the original agreement\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crecord the deed,\xe2\x80\x9d say, or \xe2\x80\x9cnotify the landowner.\xe2\x80\x9d  And they informed a contracting party that unless he complied, he could not gain the benefits of his bargain.  Or viewed conversely, the Minnesota statute also \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[s] a consequence\xe2\x80\x9d for not satisfying a burden outside the contract.  Brief for Respondent 51.  For as we have shown, that law overrides a beneficiary designation only when the insured fails to send in a form to his insurer.  See <i>supra,</i> at 10.  Of course, the statutes (both old and new) vary in their specific mechanisms.  But they all make contract benefits contingent on some simple filing\xe2\x80\x94or more positively spun, enable a party to safeguard those benefits by taking an action.  And that feature is what the Court, again and again, has found dispositive.</p><p>Nor does Melin\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish the cases gain force when framed in terms of rights and remedies.  First, not all the old statutes, as a formal matter, confined the consequence of noncompliance to the remedial sphere.  In <i>Gilfillan</i>, for example, the result of failing to give written consent to a settlement was to diminish the interest rate a bondholder got, not to prevent him from enforcing a claim against others.  And second, even when the consequence formally related to enforcement\xe2\x80\x94for example, precluding an earlier purchaser from contesting a later one\xe2\x80\x99s title\xe2\x80\x94the laws in fact wiped out substantive rights.  Failure to record or notify, as noted earlier, would mean that the contracting party lost what (according to his agreement) was his land or mortgage or mineral interest.  See <i>supra,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  In <i>Texaco</i>, we replied to an argument like Melin\xe2\x80\x99s by saying that when the results of \xe2\x80\x9celiminating a remedy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextinguishing a right\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cidentical,\xe2\x80\x9d the Contracts Clause \xe2\x80\x9canalysis is the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 528; see <i>El Paso</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 506\xe2\x80\x93507.  That statement rebuts Melin\xe2\x80\x99s claim too.  Once again: Just like Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s statute, the laws discussed above hinged core contractual benefits on compliance with noncontractual paperwork burdens.  When all is said and done, that likeness controls.</p><p>For those reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p><i>It is so ordered</i>.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0See Ala.

See Brief for Respondent 6\xe2\x80\x9310, 18\xe2\x80\x9333.  Part of Melin\xe2\x80\x99s argument focuses on the back half of the test, which we do not reach today.

Because people are <i>inattentive</i> to their life insurance beneficiary designations when they divorce, the legislature needs to change those designations retroactively to ensure they aren\xe2\x80\x99t misdirected.  But because those same people are simultaneously <i>attentive</i> to beneficiary designations (not to mention the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s activity), they will surely undo the change if they don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.  And even if that weren\xe2\x80\x99t true, it would hardly matter.  People know <i>existing</i> divorce laws sometimes allow <i>courts </i>to reform insurance contracts.  So people should know a <i>legislature</i> might enact <i>new</i> laws upending insurance contracts at divorce.  For these reasons, a statute rewriting the most important term of a life insurance policy\xe2\x80\x94who gets paid\xe2\x80\x94somehow doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially impair\xe2\x80\x9d the contract.

Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s statute automatically alters life insurance policies upon divorce to remove a former spouse as beneficiary.  Everyone agrees that the law is valid when applied prospectively to policies purchased after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  But Minnesota wants to apply its law retroactively to policies purchased before the statute\xe2\x80\x99s adoption.

The Court explained that any legislative deviation from a contract\xe2\x80\x99s obligations, \xe2\x80\x9chowever minute, or apparently immaterial,\xe2\x80\x9d violates the Constitution.  <i>Green</i> v. <i>Biddle</i>, 8 Wheat. 1, 84 (1823).  \xe2\x80\x9cAll the commentators, and all the adjudicated cases upon Constitutional Law agree[d] in th[is] fundamental propositio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Winter</i> v. <i>Jones</i>, 10 Ga. 190, 195 (1851).  But while absolute in its field, the Clause also left significant room for legislatures to address changing social conditions.  States could regulate contractual rights prospectively.  <i>Ogden</i> v. <i>Saunders</i>, 12 Wheat. 213, 262 (1827).  They could retroactively alter contractual <i>remedies</i>, so long as they did so reasonably.  <i>Sturges</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 200.  And perhaps they could even alter contracts without \xe2\x80\x9cimpairing\xe2\x80\x9d their obligations if they made the parties whole by paying just compensation.  See <i>West River Bridge Co.</i> v. <i>Dix</i>, 6 How. 507, 532\xe2\x80\x93533 (1848); <i>El Paso</i> v. <i>Simmons</i>,\n\n379 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497, 525 (1965) (Black, J., dissenting).  But what they could <i>not</i> do is destroy substantive contract rights\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cObligation of Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d that the Clause protects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More recently, though, the Court has charted a different course.  Our modern cases permit a state to \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial[ly] impai[r]\xe2\x80\x9d a contractual obligation in pursuit of \xe2\x80\x9ca significant and legitimate public purpose\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the impairment is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Energy Reserves Group, Inc.</i> v. <i>Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.</i>,\n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 411\xe2\x80\x93412 (1983).  That test seems hard to square with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s original public meaning.  After all, the Constitution does not speak of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d impairments\xe2\x80\x94it bars \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d impairment.  Under a balancing approach, too, how are the people to know today whether their lawful contracts will be enforced tomorrow, or instead undone by a legislative majority with different sympathies?  Should we worry that a balancing test risks investing judges with discretion to choose which contracts to enforce\xe2\x80\x94a discretion that might be exercised with an eye to the identity (and popularity) of the parties or contracts at hand?  How are judges supposed to balance the often radically incommensurate goods found in contracts and legislation?  And does this test risk reducing the \xe2\x80\x9cContract Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cCourt\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\xe2\x80\x9d about the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the legislation at hand?  <i>Simmons</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529 (Black, J., dissenting).  Many critics have raised serious objections along these and other lines.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>ibid.</i>; Kmiec &amp; McGinnis, <i>supra,</i> at 552; Rappaport, Note, A Procedural Approach to the Contract Clause, 93 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 918, 918 (1984); Epstein, Toward a Revitalization of the Contract Clause, 51 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev 703, 705\xe2\x80\x93717 (1984); J. Ely, The Contract Clause: A Constitutional History 7\xe2\x80\x9329 (2016).  They deserve a thoughtful reply, if not in this case then in another.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even under our modern precedents, though, I still do not see how the statute before us might survive unscathed.  Recall that our recent precedents indicate a state law \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially impairing\xe2\x80\x9d contracts violates the Contracts Clause unless it is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d in light of a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and legitimate public purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start with the substantial impairment question.  No one pays life insurance premiums for the joy of it.  Or even for the pleasure of knowing that the insurance company will eventually have to cough up money to <i>someone</i>.  As the Court concedes, the choice of beneficiary is the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whole point.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  So when a state alters life insurance contracts by undoing their beneficiary designations it surely \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially impairs\xe2\x80\x9d them.  This Court has already recognized as much, holding that a law \xe2\x80\x9cdisplac[ing] the beneficiary selected by the insured .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and plac[ing] someone else in her stead .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. frustrates\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a scheme designed to deliver proceeds to the named beneficiary.  <i>Hillman</i> v. <i>Maretta</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483, 494 (2013) (quoting <i>Wissner</i> v. <i>Wissner</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 655, 659 (1950) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As Justice Washington explained long ago, legislation \xe2\x80\x9cchanging the objects of [the donor\xe2\x80\x99s] bounty .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. changes so materially the terms of a contract\xe2\x80\x9d that the law can only be said to \xe2\x80\x9cimpair its obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College</i> v. <i>Woodward</i>, 4 Wheat. 518, 662 (1819) (concurring opinion).  Just so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cases like ours illustrate the point.  Kaye Melin testified that, despite their divorce, she and the decedent, Mark Sveen, agreed (repeatedly) to keep each other as the primary beneficiaries in their respective life insurance policies.  Affidavit of Kaye Melin in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9305015, Dkt. No. 46, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb63, 4, 10\xe2\x80\x9314.  Ms. Melin noted that they adopted this arrangement not only because they remained friends but because they paid the policy premiums from their joint checking account.  Deposition of Kaye Melin in No. 14\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x930515, Dkt. No. 45\xe2\x80\x934, pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 64\xe2\x80\x9365.  Of course, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure whether removing Ms. Melin as beneficiary undid Mr. Sveen\xe2\x80\x99s true wishes.  The case comes to us after no one was able to meet Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s clear and convincing evidence standard to prove Mr. Sveen\xe2\x80\x99s intent.  But what we do know is the retroactive removal of Ms. Melin undid the central term of the contract Mr. Sveen signed and left in place for years, even after his divorce, until the day he died.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor are arrangements like the ones Ms. Melin described so unusual.  As the federal government has recognized, revocation on divorce statutes cannot be assumed to \xe2\x80\x9ceffectuat[e] the insured\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98true\xe2\x80\x99 intent\xe2\x80\x9d because a policyholder \xe2\x80\x9cmight want his ex-spouse to receive insurance proceeds for a number of reasons\xe2\x80\x94out of a sense of obligation, remorse, or continuing affection, or to help care for children of the marriage that remain in the ex-spouse\xe2\x80\x99s cus- tody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in <i>Hillman</i> v. <i>Maretta</i>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2012, No. 11\xe2\x80\x931221, p.\xc2\xa028.  After all, leaving your ex-spouse life insurance proceeds can be a cheaper, quicker, and more private way to provide for minor or disabled children than leaving the matter to a trustee or other fiduciary.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Feder &amp; Sitkoff, Revocable Trusts and Incapacity Planning: More Than Just a Will Substitute, 24 Elder L.\xc2\xa0J. 1, 15\xe2\x80\x9318 (2016).  For these reasons, the federal government and nearly half the states today do not treat divorce as automatically revoking insurance beneficiary designations.  Brief for Petitioners 8\xe2\x80\x939, and nn. 1\xe2\x80\x932; <i>Hillman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 494\xe2\x80\x93495.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider next the question of the impairment\xe2\x80\x99s reason- ableness.  Our cases suggest that a substantial impairment is unreasonable when \xe2\x80\x9can evident and more moderate course would serve [the state\xe2\x80\x99s] purposes equally well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States Trust Co. of N. Y.</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 31 (1977); see also <i>Allied Structural Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Spannaus</i>,\n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, 247 (1978) (analyzing whether an impairment of private contracts \xe2\x80\x9cwas necessary to meet an important general social problem\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s stated purpose is to ensure proceeds aren\xe2\x80\x99t misdirected to a former spouse because a policyholder forgets to update his beneficiary designation after divorce.  But the state could have easily achieved that goal without impairing contracts <i>at all</i>.  It could have required courts to confirm that divorcing couples have reviewed their life insurance designations.  See Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93111.1(E) (2017); Utah Code \xc2\xa730\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x935(1)(e)(i) (2018).  It could have instructed insurance companies to notify policyholders of their right to change beneficiary designations.  It could have disseminated information on its own.  Or it could have required attorneys in divorce proceedings to address the question with affected parties.  A host of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights organizations have advocated for these and other alternatives in various states.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Brief for Women\xe2\x80\x99s Law Project et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>34\xe2\x80\x9335.  Yet there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence Minnesota investigated any of them, let alone found them wanting.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">What\xe2\x80\x99s the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reply?  It says that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to decide whether the statute <i>reasonably</i> <i>impairs</i> contracts because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t <i>substantially impair</i> them in the first place.  It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to see why the Court might take this tack given the many obvious and less burdensome alternatives Minnesota never considered.  To save the law, the Court must place all its chips on a \xe2\x80\x9cno substantial impairment\xe2\x80\x9d argument.  The gamble, though, proves a tricky one.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court first stresses that individuals sometimes neglect their beneficiary designations after divorce.  Because of this, it says, Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law affords \xe2\x80\x9cmany\xe2\x80\x9d persons what they would want if only they had thought about it.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8.  But as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the law depends on a stereotype about divorcing couples that not everyone fits.  A sizeable (and maybe growing) number of people <i>do </i>want to keep their former spouses as beneficiaries.  Brief for Women\xe2\x80\x99s Law Project 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  Even the Court admits the law\xe2\x80\x99s presumption will sometimes prove \xe2\x80\x9cwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  And that tells us all we need to know.  That the law is <i>only</i> <i>sometimes </i>wrong in predicting what divorcing policyholders want may go some way to establishing its <i>reasonableness</i> at the second step of our inquiry.  But at the first step, where we ask only whether the law substantially impairs contracts, the answer is unavoidable.  The statute substantially impairs contracts by displacing the term that is the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whole point\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the contract.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  This Court would never say a law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t substantially burden a minority\xe2\x80\x99s religious practice because it reflects most people\xe2\x80\x99s preferences.  See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520 (1993).  Equally, I do not see how a statute doesn\xe2\x80\x99t substantially impair contracts just because it reflects \xe2\x80\x9cmany\xe2\x80\x9d people\xe2\x80\x99s preferences.  <i>Ante, </i>at 8.  The Contracts Clause does not seek to maximize the bottom line but to protect minority rights \xe2\x80\x9cfrom improvident majoritarian impairment.\xe2\x80\x9d  L.\xc2\xa0Tribe, American Constitutional Law \xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x938, p. 613 (2d ed. 1988).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this problem introduces an apparent paradox.  If the statute substantially impairs contracts, it says, the impairment can be easily undone.  Anyone unhappy with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s beneficiary re-designation can just re-re-designate the beneficiary later.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  Yet the Court just finished telling us the statute is justified because most policyholders <i>neglect</i> their beneficiary designations after divorce.  Both claims cannot be true.  The statute cannot simultaneously be necessary because people are inattentive to the details of their insurance policies and constitutional because they are hyperaware of those same details.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps seeking a way out of this problem, the Court offers an entirely different line of argument.  Here the Court suggests the statute doesn\xe2\x80\x99t substantially impair contracts because it does no more than a divorce court might.  <i>Ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But this argument doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work either.  <i>Courts </i>may apply <i>pre-existing</i> law to alter a beneficiary designation to ensure an equitable distribution of marital property in specific cases.  That hardly means <i>legislatures </i>may retroactively <i>change</i> the law to rearrange beneficiary designations for everyone.  A court can fine you for violating an existing law against jaywalking.  That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a legislature could hold you retroactively liable for violating a new law against jaywalking that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist when you crossed the street.  No one would take that idea seriously when it comes to crime, and the Contracts Clause ensures we don\xe2\x80\x99t when it comes to contracts, either.  After all, the Clause applies only to the \xe2\x80\x9claw[s]\xe2\x80\x9d legislatures \xe2\x80\x9cpass,\xe2\x80\x9d not to the rulings of courts.  <i>Tidal Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Flanagan</i>,\n\n263 U.\xc2\xa0S. 444, 451 (1924) (emphasis deleted).  That\xe2\x80\x99s because legislatures exist to pass new laws of general applicability responsive to majoritar- ian will, often upsetting settled expectations along the way.  The same does not hold true for courts that are supposed to apply existing laws to discrete cases and controversies independently and without consulting shifting political winds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court finally claims that its course finds support in cases where we\xe2\x80\x99ve approved retroactive legislation.  <i>Ante, </i>at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  Those cases, though, involved statutes altering contractual <i>remedies</i>.  <i>Home Building &amp; Loan Assn.</i> v. <i>Blaisdell</i>,\n\n290 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398, 434, and n.\xc2\xa013 (1934) (noting that each of the 19th century cases relied on by the Court today affected only \xe2\x80\x9cremedial processes\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s law changes the key contractual obligation\xe2\x80\x94who gets the insurance proceeds\xe2\x80\x94not the method by which the contract\xe2\x80\x99s existing obligation is satisfied.  Although the Constitution allows legislatures some flexibility to address changing social conditions through retroactive remedial legislation, it does not permit upsetting settled expectations in contractual obligations.  See, <i>e.g., Fletcher</i> v. <i>Peck</i>, 6 Cranch 87, 137\xe2\x80\x93138 (1810);<i> Simmons</i>, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 526 (Black, J., dissenting).  We must respect that line found in the text of the Constitution, not elide it.  Indeed, our precedent teaches that if remedial changes are just disguised efforts at impairing obligations they will violate the Constitution too.  <i>Blaisdell</i>, 290 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 434, n. 13 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider just how different our case is from the classic remedial change the Contracts Clause permits.  In <i>Jackson </i>v.<i> Lamphire</i>, 3 Pet. 280 (1830), a shady landowner sold the same tract to two people.  <i>Id.,</i> at 287\xe2\x80\x93288.  The Court held that the second buyer was entitled to keep the land because he recorded the deed as a retroactive law required.  <i>Id.,</i> at 289\xe2\x80\x93290.  At the same time, nothing in <i>Jackson</i> or the new statute stopped the first buyer (who failed to record his deed) from obtaining damages from the seller for breach of contract.  See <i>id.,</i> at 287\xe2\x80\x93291.  The statute altered the first buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remedy, but he remained free to enforce the obligation found in his contract.  By contrast, the statute here changes the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whole point\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s obligation, substituting a new beneficiary in place of the one found in the contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even the remedial case on which the Court leans most heavily does little to help its cause.  In <i>Gilfillan</i> v. <i>Union Canal Co. of Pa.</i>,\n\n109 U.\xc2\xa0S. 401 (1883), the Court upheld a statute requiring bondholders to enforce their contract rights within a shortened timeframe (that is, altering the remedy) or else accept a reorganization plan that threatened a poorer rate of interest.  <i>Id.,</i> at 402\xe2\x80\x93403, 406<i>.  </i>The Court gave three primary reasons for upholding this change.  It emphasized that the bonds at issue were \xe2\x80\x9cof a peculiar character\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ceach bondholder under them enter[ed] by fair implication into certain contract relations with\xe2\x80\x9d the other bondholders who approved the reorganization.  <i>Id.</i>, at 403.  It observed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a calamity common to all\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d had occurred, as the company that issued the bonds \xe2\x80\x9cwas bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d and payment of \xe2\x80\x9cits debts in the ordinary way was impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 405.  Finally, it added that the plaintiff challenging the statute had \xe2\x80\x9cactual notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the law and so faced no difficulty in asserting his contract rights in a timely manner.  <i>Id.,</i> at 406<i>.  </i>These considerations, the Court concluded, justified shortening the limitations period for obtaining full relief even though it might reduce a late-moving party\xe2\x80\x99s interest rate a few points.  No comparable considerations are present here.  And this statute doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just <i>reduce</i> Ms. Melin\xe2\x80\x99s remedy; it <i>denies</i> her one altogether.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judicial power to declare a law unconstitutional should never be lightly invoked.  But the law before us cannot survive an encounter with even the breeziest of Contracts Clause tests.  It substantially impairs life insurance contracts by retroactively revising their key term.  No one can offer any reasonable justification for this impairment in light of readily available alternatives.  Acknowledging this much doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even require us to hold the statute invalid in all applications, only that it cannot be applied to contracts formed before its enactment.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
