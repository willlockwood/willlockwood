The historical records show that, at most, the intentions of the Constitution\'s Framers and Ratifiers were ambiguous on the subject.  Moreover, since federal question actions unquestionably are "suits in law or equity," the plain language of the Amendment refutes the argument.  Nor does the argument offer any satisfactory explanation for the overwhelming rejection of another amendment that would have allowed citizen suits against States for causes of action arising under treaties.  The principle of sovereign immunity has been deeply embedded in our federal system since its inception, and is required because of the sensitive problems inherent in making one sovereign appear against its will in the courts of another.  That States may not be sued absent waiver or congressional enactment is a necessary consequence of their role in a system of dual sovereignties.

Relying on \xc2\xa7 33 of the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688, she filed suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Highway Department and the State of Texas. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the action as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  533 F.Supp. 403, 407 (1982).  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, with each judge writing separately.  739 F.2d 1034 (1984).  On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  780 F.2d 1268 (1986).  The court recognized that <em>Parden v.

If a State waives its immunity and consents to suit in federal court, the suit is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  <em>Clark v.

But, because "[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights," <em>Edelman v.

Consequently, Congress can abrogate the Eleventh Amendment without the States\' consent when it acts pursuant to its power "<em>to enforce, by appropriate legislation\' the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment."  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting U.S.Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa7 5).  As the Court of Appeals noted in this case, we have required that "Congress must express its intention to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in unmistakable language in the statute itself."  <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#243">473 U. S. 243</a></span>.

We note that the question whether the State of Texas has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity is not before us.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the State has not consented to Jones Act suits in federal court.  The petition for certiorari does not address this issue, and we do not regard it as fairly included in the questions on which certiorari was granted. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Indeed, at oral argument counsel for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 483 U.

We therefore have no occasion to consider petitioner\'s argument in her brief on the merits that the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann., Art. 6252-19 (Vernon, 1970, as amended 1973 Tex.Gen.Laws, ch. 50) constitutes an express waiver of the State\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Brief for Petitioner 29-34.  We accept the holdings of the Court of Appeals and the District Court that it does not.</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s remaining argument is that Congress has abrogated the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit under the Jones Act.  We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to \xc2\xa7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>See County of Oneida v.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Petitioner\'s argument fails in any event, because Congress has not expressed in unmistakable statutory language its intention to allow States to be sued in federal court under the Jones Act.  It is true that the Act extends to "<em>[a]ny</em> seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment," \xc2\xa7 33 (emphasis added).  But the Eleventh Amendment marks a constitutional distinction between the States and other employers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 483 U. S. 476</a></p><p> seamen.  Because of the role of the States in our federal system,</p>\n<p>"[a] general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Atascadero State Hospital v.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Moreover, the delicate problem of enforcing judgments against the States, that was raised by both Federalists and anti-Federalists, would have arisen in cases presenting a federal question as well as in other cases.</p>\n<p>It is true, as the Court observed in <em>Hans, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html#14">134 U.

Despite the strong rhetoric in the dissent, these statements fall far short of demonstrating a consensus that ratification of the Constitution would abrogate the sovereign immunity of the States.  Indeed, the representations of Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall that the Constitution did <em>not</em> abrogate the States\' sovereign immunity may have been essential to ratification. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  For example, the New York Convention appended to its ratification resolution a declaration of understanding that</p>\n<p>"the Judicial Power of the United States in cases in which a State may be a party does not extend to criminal Prosecutions, or to authorize any Suit by any Person against a State."</p>\n<p>2 Documentary History of the Constitution of the United States of America 194 (1894) [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  At most, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 483 U.

The Court held, over a dissent by Justice Iredell, that it had jurisdiction.  The reaction to <em>Chisholm</em> was swift and hostile.  The Eleventh Amendment passed both Houses of Congress by large majorities in 1794.  Within two years of the <em>Chisholm</em> decision, the Eleventh Amendment was ratified by the necessary 12 States. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent, observing that jurisdiction in <em>Chisholm</em> itself was based solely on the fact that Chisholm was not a citizen of Georgia, argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to cases presenting a federal question.

Federal question actions unquestionably are suits "in law or equity"; thus, the plain language of the Amendment refutes this argument.

Hans, a citizen of Louisiana, brought an action against the State in federal court alleging that its failure to pay interest on certain bonds violated the Contract Clause.  The Court considered substantially the same historical materials relied on by the dissent, and unanimously held that the action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  Justice Bradley\'s opinion for the Court observed:</p>\n<p>"Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a State from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States:  can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the States?

The dissent\'s statement that sovereign immunity "protect[s] the States from the consequences of their illegal conduct" erroneously suggests that aggrieved individuals are left with no remedy for harmful state actions.

In fact, these early cases cast considerable doubt on the dissent\'s position.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>United States v. Peters</em> was a suit against the heirs of David Rittenhouse, who had served as treasurer of the State of Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary War.  While Rittenhouse was treasurer, the State had seized a British vessel and sold it as a prize of war.  Rittenhouse had deposited most of the proceeds in his own account, and had not turned them over to the State at the time of his death.  Chief Justice Marshall\'s opinion for the Court turned on the facts that "the suit was not instituted against the state, or its treasurer, but against the executrixes of David Rittenhouse," and that the State "had neither possession of, nor right to, the property."  5 Cranch at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/115/case.html#139">9 U.

Indeed, language in the Court\'s opinion suggests that an action against the State would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment:</p>\n<p>"The [eleventh] amendment simply provides that no suit shall be commenced or prosecuted against a state.  The state cannot be made a defendant to a suit brought by an individual; but it remains the duty of the courts of the United States to decide all cases brought before them by citizens of one state against citizens of a different state where a state is not necessarily a defendant."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/115/case.html#139">9 U.

S. 492</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The dissent\'s reliance on <em>Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, supra,</em> also is misplaced.  Madrazo, a Spanish subject, sued the Governor of Georgia in admiralty to obtain possession of a cargo of slaves or the proceeds from their sale.  Chief Justice Marshall\'s opinion for the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment applies</p>\n<p>"where the chief magistrate of a state is sued, not by his name, but by his style of office, and the claim made upon him is entirely in his official character."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/26/110/case.html#123">26 U.

Instead, it held that the District Court where the action was filed had no jurisdiction regardless of whether the Eleventh Amendment applied. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>Madrazo then filed an original admiralty proceeding directly against Georgia in this Court.  Once again, the Court avoided the question whether the Eleventh Amendment applies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 483 U. S. 493</a></p><p> to suits in admiralty.  Instead, the Court concluded that the case was not an admiralty action, but was "a mere personal suit against a state to recover proceeds in its possession."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/627/case.html">Ex parte Madrazzo,</a></span></em> 7 Pet. 627,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/32/627/case.html#632">32 U.

The general principle of state sovereign immunity has been adhered to without exception by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 483 U. S. 494</a></p><p> this Court for almost a century.  The dissent nevertheless urges the Court to ignore <em>stare decisis</em> and overrule the long and unbroken series of precedents reaffirming this principle.  If the Court were to overrule these precedents, a number of other major decisions also would have to reconsidered.

To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe?  How could recoveries be enforced?  It is evident, it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a preexisting right of the State governments, a power which would involve such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable."</p>\n<p>The Federalist No. 81, pp. 548-549 (J.

Of course, the possibility that Marshall changed his views on sovereign immunity after the Constitution was ratified, or espoused a broader view of sovereign immunity only to secure ratification, does not imply that the views he expressed at the Virginia Convention should be disregarded.  In any event, the dissent places too much weight on <em>Cohens</em> and <em>Osborn.</em>  In <em>Cohens,</em> it was the State that began criminal proceedings against the Cohenses.  It had long been understood that sovereign immunity did not prevent persons convicted of crimes from appealing.  <em>See</em> D. Currie, The Constitution and the Supreme Court, 1789-1888, p. 99 (1985).  Accordingly, Chief Justice Marshall\'s opinion in <em>Cohens</em> distinguished a writ of error, which is but "a continuation of the same suit," from an independent suit against the State.  6 Wheat. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html#409">19 U.

This view later was embodied in the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the States, or to the people, powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.  Of course, the Constitution does not expressly abrogate the sovereign immunity of the States.

S. 515</a></span>-516, Justice Iredell\'s opinion rests primarily on the absence of a <em>statutory</em> provision conferring jurisdiction on the Court in cases such as Chisholm\'s.  To the extent that Justice Iredell discussed the constitutional question, his opinion is consistent with the more recent decisions of this Court:</p>\n<p>"So much, however, has been said on the Constitution that it may not be improper to intimate that my present opinion is strongly against any construction of it which will admit, <em>under any circumstances,</em> a compulsive suit against the State for the recovery of money."</p>\n<p>2 Dall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html#449">2 U.

The dissent does not attempt to explain these remarks, except to observe that they were unnecessary to Justice Iredell\'s decision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s principal textual argument rests on the similarity between the language of the Amendment and the language of the State-Citizen Diversity Clauses in Article III.  <em>See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#286">473 U. S. 286</a></span>-287 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  This argument cannot explain why Congress chose to apply the Amendment to "any suit in law or equity," rather than any suit where jurisdiction is predicated solely on diversity of citizenship.  Instead, the dissent reads the Amendment to accomplish even less than its plain language suggests.  As the Court long has recognized, the speed and vigor of the Nation\'s response to <em>Chisholm</em> suggests that the Eleventh Amendment should be construed broadly so as to further the federal interests that the Court misapprehended in <em>Chisholm.</em>  The dissent also has some difficulty explaining the Clause in Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, that extends the federal judicial power "to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party."  Although arguments analogous to those in the dissent would suggest that this Clause abrogated the sovereign immunity of the United States, the dissent stops short of such an extreme conclusion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>In an effort to explain the overwhelming rejection of Gallatin\'s amendment, the dissent suggests that Congress would have enumerated all the Article III heads of jurisdiction if it had intended to bar federal question actions against the States.  <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#287">473 U. S. 287</a></span>, n. 40.  The dissent also speculates, without citing a shred of historical evidence, that the Senate may have rejected the proposed amendment to avoid giving the impression that it was barring federal question actions not based on a treaty.  Finally, the dissent observes that federal courts had no general original federal question jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act of 1789.  The dissent thus implies that the question was regarded as unimportant at the time.  But the dissent also concedes that Senator Gallatin\'s proposed amendment was so unpopular that its adoption might have resulted in a constitutional convention.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This concession hardly is consistent with the dissent\'s assertion that adoption of the Gallatin amendment would have had no practical significance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, for example, Welch is not without a remedy:  she may file a workers\' compensation claim against the State under the Texas Tort Claims Act, ch. 292, 1969 Tex.

The only argument the dissent advances in favor of this distinction is that "admiralty is not mentioned in the Eleventh Amendment."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">483 U.

The perceived distinction is simply unsound.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The trial in <em>United States v. Bright,</em> 24 Fed.Cas. 1232 (No. 14,647) (CC Pa. 1809), occurred after the Court\'s decision in <em>Peters.</em> <em>Peters</em> therefore cannot possibly have "supported" the holding of <em>Bright</em> in the sense of approval or endorsement.  Bright was an officer of the Pennsylvania state militia who defended the Rittenhouse home against federal soldiers attempting to enforce the judgment in <em>Peters.</em>  Circuit Justice Washington\'s remarks, that the dissent characterizes as the "holding" of the case, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#498">483 U. S. 498</a></span>, actually were part of his charge to the jury.  The Court had no opportunity to consider Justice Washington\'s statements, because it lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal from Bright\'s conviction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court noted that the action was between a State and a foreign subject, an action within the Court\'s original jurisdiction under Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution and \xc2\xa7 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 80.  Thus, the Court concluded that, "if the 11th amendment . . . does not extend to proceedings in admiralty, it was a case for the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court," <em>Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo,</em> 1 Pet. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/26/110/case.html#124">26 U. S. 124</a></span>, because it was a suit between a State and a foreign subject.  This conclusion is surprising in view of the fact that the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, \xc2\xa7 13, 1 Stat. 73, 80, conferred original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction of such actions on the Court.  Congress had conferred admiralty jurisdiction on the district courts in \xc2\xa7 9 of the Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 76-77.  Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall\'s opinion for the Court in <em>Cohens v. Virginia,</em> 6 Wheat. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html#394">19 U. S. 394</a></span>-402, already had indicated that the Court\'s original jurisdiction under Article III is not exclusive.  <em>See</em> D. Currie, The Constitution and the Supreme Court, 1789-1888, p. 105, n. 98 (1985).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>It is of course true, as the dissent observes, that Justice Story\'s treatise on the Constitution observed that a suit in admiralty is not, strictly speaking, a suit in law or equity.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">483 U. S. 499</span> (quoting 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 660-561 (1833)).  Justice Story, however, merely observed that "[i]t has been doubted whether [the eleventh] amendment extends to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," <em>id.</em> at 560, and cited only the cases discussed above.  Moreover, Justice Story was noted for his expansive view of the admiralty jurisdiction of federal courts.  <em>See, e.g., De Lovio v. Boit,</em> 7 Fed. Cas. 418 (No. 3,776) (CC Mass. 1815); Note, 37 Am.L.Rev. 911, 916 (1903) ("It was said of the late Justice Story, that, if a bucket of water were brought into his court with a corn cob floating in it, he would at once extend the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States over it").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, the dissent accords little weight to early cases applying the general admiralty principle that maritime property belonging to a sovereign cannot be seized.  <em>E.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/11/116/case.html">11 U.

As noted above, <em>Hans</em> has been reaffirmed in case after case, often unanimously and by exceptionally strong Courts.  The two principal holdings of <em>Hans</em> that the dissent challenges are that the federal judicial power does not extend either to suits against States that arise under federal law, or to suits brought against a State by its own citizens.  If these holdings were rejected, the Court would overrule at least 17 cases, in addition to <em>Hans</em> itself.  Twelve of these cases relied on both of these principles.  <em>See Papasan v.

As we have noted, the fragments of historical evidence at the time of the adoption of the Constitution are as supportive of <em>Hans v. Louisiana</em> as they are of the dissent.  In attaching weight to this ambiguous history, it is not immaterial that we are a century further removed from the events at issue than were the Justices who unanimously agreed in <em>Hans.</em>  Not one of the 17 cases the dissent would overrule concludes that the historical evidence calls into question the principle of state sovereign immunity or justifies the ignoring of <em>stare decisis.</em>  As for the view that it would be "pernicious" to protect States from liability for their "unlawful conduct," we have noted above that an aggrieved citizen such as petitioner in fact has a bundle of possible remedies.  <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#488">483 U. S. 488</a></span>, and n.19.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.</p>\n<p>The Court expressly stops short of addressing the issue whether the Jones Act affords a remedy to seamen employed by the States.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#476">483 U. S. 476</a></span>, n. 6.  The Court, however, has already construed the Jones Act to extend remedies to such seamen.  <em>Petty v.

Congress has not disturbed this construction, and the Court, as I understand it, does not now purport to do so.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner in this case did not assert as a basis for reversing the judgment that <em>Hans v.

S. 496</a></p><p> had been wrongly decided.  That argument was introduced by an <em>amicus,</em> addressed only briefly in respondents\' brief, and touched upon only lightly at oral argument.  I find both the correctness of <em>Hans</em> as an original matter, and the feasibility, if it was wrong, of correcting it without distorting what we have done in tacit reliance upon it, complex enough questions that I am unwilling to address them in a case whose presentation focused on other matters.</p>\n<p>I find it unnecessary to do so, in any event.  Regardless of what one may think of <em>Hans,</em> it has been assumed to be the law for nearly a century.  During that time, Congress has enacted many statutes -- including the Jones Act and the provisions of the Federal Employers\' Liability Act (FELA) which it incorporates -- on the assumption that States were immune from suits by individuals.  Even if we were now to find that assumption to have been wrong, we could not, in reason, interpret the statutes as though the assumption never existed.  Thus, although the terms of the Jones Act (through its incorporation of the FELA) apply to all common carriers by water, I do not read them to apply to States.

I adhere to my belief that the doctrine "rests on flawed premises, misguided history, and an untenable vision of the needs of the federal system it purports to protect."  <em>Atascadero State Hospital v.

In my view, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the District Court\'s jurisdiction over the Jones Act suit by Jean Welch against the State of Texas and the Texas Highway Department for four independent reasons.  First, the Amendment does not limit federal jurisdiction over suits in admiralty.  Second, the Amendment bars only actions against a State by citizens of another State or of a foreign nation.  Third, the Amendment applies only to diversity suits.  Fourth, even assuming the Eleventh Amendment were applicable to the present case, Congress abrogated state immunity from suit under the Jones Act, which incorporates the Federal Employers\' Liability Act (FELA).  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Article III provides that the "judicial power" assigned to federal courts extends not only to "Cases in Law and Equity," but also "to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction." [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In the instant case, the District Court stated that the "plaintiff brought this suit in admiralty."  533 F.Supp. 403, 404 (SD Tex.1982).  The Eleventh Amendment limits the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 483 U. S. 498</a></p><p> "Judicial power" in certain suits "in law or equity." [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Therefore, even if the Eleventh Amendment does bar federal jurisdiction over cases in which a State is sued by its own citizen, its express language reveals that it does so <em>only</em> in "Cases in Law and Equity," and not in "Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>The leading case on the relationship between admiralty jurisdiction and the Eleventh Amendment for over a century was <em>United States v. Bright,</em> 24 Fed.Cas. 1232 (No. 14,647) (CC Pa. 1809), which was written by Circuit Justice Bushrod Washington.  It held that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a suit in admiralty against a State.  Justice Washington acknowledged that a suit against a State raised sensitive issues, but believed himself bound by the fact that the Amendment does not refer to suits in admiralty.  Furthermore, he noted that a court usually possesses the subject matter of the suit (<em>i.e.,</em> the ship) in an admiralty <em>in rem</em> proceeding, and thereby avoids the "delicate" issue of confronting a State with a decree commanding it to relinquish certain property.  <em>Id.</em> at 1236.  This was not a controversial holding in its day.  While the Court during Chief Justice Marshall\'s tenure did not have an opportunity to reach this issue, its dictum in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/115/case.html">United States v.

Orth, The Judicial Power of the United States 37 (1987).  Justice Joseph Story wrote in 1833 that:</p>\n<p>"[T]he language of the amendment is that \'the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit <em>in law or equity.</em>\'  But a suit in the admiralty is not, correctly speaking, a suit in law or in equity, but is often spoken of in contradistinction to both."</p>\n<p>3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 560-561 (1833) (emphasis in original), citing <em>United States v. Peters, supra; United States v. Bright, supra; Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, supra.</em>  Nineteenth-century commentators regarded <em>Bright</em> as having settled the matter.  Peter du Ponceau, in his lectures to the Law Academy of Philadelphia in 1834 simply stated: "It has been held that this restriction [by the Eleventh Amendment] does not extend to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."  P. du Ponceau, A Brief View of the Constitution of the United States 37-38 (1834).  <em>See</em> Fletcher, A Historical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 483 U.

S. 490</a></span> (1921).  <em>Ex parte New York, No. 1</em> involved libel actions against a state official in his official capacity in connection with vessels operated by the State of New York.  The Court held that a State was immune under the Eleventh Amendment from an <em>in personam</em> suit in admiralty brought by a private individual without the State\'s consent.</p>\n<p>The Court did not attempt to justify its obliteration of <em>Bright</em>\'s distinction between cases in admiralty and cases in law or equity, but simply referred in passing to <em>Hans v.

It did not address the effect of the Eleventh Amendment on the extension of judicial power in Article III to admiralty suits.</p>\n<p>The distinction between admiralty cases and ordinary cases in law or equity was not a casual or technical one from the viewpoint of the Framers of the Constitution.  Admiralty was a highly significant, perhaps the most important, subject matter area for federal jurisdiction at the end of the 18th century.</p>\n<p>"Maritime commerce was then the jugular vein of the Thirteen States.  The need for a body of law applicable throughout the nation was recognized by every shade of opinion in the Constitutional Convention."</p>\n<p>F. Frankfurter &amp; J.

Outside of <em>Ex parte New York, No. 1,</em> the Court has not ignored this legal distinction between admiralty and other cases in any other instance of constitutional and statutory interpretation.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/354/case.html">358 U.

It involved a suit based on the <em>common law</em> of admiralty and state law.  In contrast, the present admiralty suit seeks to enforce a <em>federal statute,</em> the Jones Act.  Although the Jones Act is deemed not to satisfy the Court\'s requirement that Congress use "unmistakable language" to abrogate a State\'s sovereign immunity, it does explicitly provide for federal jurisdiction for suits under the statute.  Congress specifically indicated in the Jones Act that "any seaman" [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] may maintain an action for personal injury under the Act, and that "[J]urisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located."  46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688.  Whatever the merits of the "unmistakable language" requirement in cases of law and equity, it is completely out of place in admiralty cases resting on federal statute, in light of the fact that admiralty is not mentioned in the Eleventh Amendment. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Accordingly, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 483 U. S. 503</a></p><p> in admiralty cases involving federal legislation, any bar implied by <em>Ex parte New York, No. 1</em> against common law suits in admiralty is inapplicable. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, a narrow holding allowing federal jurisdiction over Welch\'s suit in admiralty under the Jones Act against the State of Texas is consistent with precedent and the will of Congress, [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] and prevents further erosion of a legal distinction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 483 U. S. 504</a></p><p> which is difficult, if not impossible, to rationalize.  It is patently improper to extend the Eleventh Amendment doctrine of sovereign immunity any further. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment does not bar a suit under the Jones Act by a Texas citizen against the State of Texas.  The part of Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, that was affected by the Amendment provides: "The judicial Power shall extend . . . to Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of <em>another</em> State" and "between a State . . . and foreign . . . Citizens or Subjects" (emphasis added).  The Amendment uses language identical to that in Article III to bar the extension of the judicial power to a suit "against one of the United States by Citizens of <em>another</em> State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State" (emphasis added).  The congruence of the language suggests that the Amendment specifically limits only the jurisdiction conferred by the above-referenced part of Article III.  Thus, the Amendment bars only federal actions brought against a State by citizens of another State or by aliens.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court\'s view, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#480">483 U. S. 480</a></span>-484, a proper assessment of the historical record of the Constitutional Convention and the debates surrounding the state ratification conventions confirms this interpretation.  <em>See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#263">473 U. S. 263</a></span>-280 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  The Court exclusively relies on the remarks of Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall at the Virginia Convention to support its contrary position.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#480">483 U. S. 480</a></span>-484.  But these statements must be considered in context.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 483 U. S. 505</a></p><p> At the Virginia Convention, discussion focused on the question of Virginia\'s liability for debts that arose under state law, and which could be brought into federal court only through diversity suits by citizens of <em>another</em> State.  <em>See</em> 3 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 533 (2d ed. 1861) (hereinafter Elliot\'s Debates) (Madison) ("[Federal] jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of <em>another</em> state is much objected to, and perhaps without reason . . .") (emphasis added); The Federalist No. 81, p. 548 (J. Cooke ed.1961) (Hamilton) ("It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens of <em>another</em> would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities . . .") (emphasis added); 3 Elliot\'s Debates 555 (Marshall) ("With respect to disputes between a state and the citizens of <em>another</em> state, its jurisdiction has been decried with unusual vehemence . . .") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Thus, the delegates to the Virginia Convention were not objecting to suits initiated by citizens of the same State; what concerned them were suits by citizens of <em>other</em> States.  The majority of the delegates who spoke at the Virginia Convention, including Mason, Henry, Pendleton, and Randolph, did not believe that state sovereign immunity provided protection against suits initiated by citizens of other States.  <em>See Atascadero, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#264">473 U. S. 264</a></span>-280.  Moreover, those attending the Virginia Convention evidently were not persuaded by the rhetoric of Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall cited by the Court.  The Convention endorsed an amendment that would have explicitly denied the federal judiciary authority over controversies between a State and citizens of other States.  3 Elliot\'s Debates 660-661.  The felt need for this amendment shows that the delegates did not believe that state sovereign immunity barred all suits against States. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 483 U. S. 506</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is little evidence that Madison [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] or Hamilton [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] believed that Article III failed to authorize diversity or federal question suits brought by citizens against States.  We know </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 483 U. S. 507</a></p><p> Marshall\'s understanding of Article III from his opinions written for the Court.  The Chief Justice, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html">Cohens v. Virginia,</a></span></em> 6 Wheat. 264 (1821), interpreted the effect of Article III on the Court\'s jurisdiction to review an appeal involving, as parties, a State and a citizen of the same State.  The State of Virginia was sued for a writ of error in the United States Supreme Court.  The writ challenged a criminal conviction obtained in a Virginia state court.  The Court rejected the State\'s contention that the Constitution denied federal jurisdiction over the appeal.  It concluded that Article III provides federal jurisdiction "to all [federal question cases] without making in its terms any exception whatever, and without any regard to the condition of party."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html#378">19 U. S. 378</a></span>.  The Chief Justice then considered whether, in the face of Article III\'s clear language, a general principle of state sovereign immunity could be implied.  He concluded:</p>\n<p>"From this general grant of jurisdiction [in federal question cases], no exception is made of those cases in which a State may be a party.  When we consider the situation of the government of the Union and of a State, in relation to each other; the nature of our constitution; the subordination of the state governments to that constitution; the great purpose for which jurisdiction over all cases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, is confided to the judicial department; <em>are we at liberty to insert in this general grant, an exception of those cases in which a State may be a party?  Will the spirit of the constitution justify this attempt to control its words?  We think it will not.</em>  We think a case arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 483 U. S. 508</a></p><p> is cognizable in the Courts of the Union, whoever may be the parties to that case."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added).  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html#382">19 U. S. 382</a></span>-383. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Cohens</em> also clearly revealed its understanding that the Eleventh Amendment was inapplicable to a suit brought by a citizen against his or her own State.  After concluding that the petition for a writ of error was not properly understood as a suit commenced or prosecuted against a State, the Chief Justice stated an alternative holding:</p>\n<p>"But should we in this be mistaken, the error does not affect the case now before the Court.  If this writ of error be a suit in the sense of the 11th amendment, it is not a suit commenced or prosecuted \'by a citizen of another State, or by a citizen or subject of any foreign State.\'  <em>It is not then within the amendment,</em> but is governed entirely by the constitution as originally framed, and we have already seen, that in its origin, the judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 483 U. S. 509</a></p><p> power was extended to all cases arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, without respect to parties."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html#412">19 U. S. 412</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall reaffirmed this view of the Eleventh Amendment when he wrote for the Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html">Osborn v. Bank of the United States,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 738,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html#857">22 U. S. 857</a></span>-858 (1824):</p>\n<p>"The amendment has its full effect, if the constitution be construed as it would have been construed, had the jurisdiction of the court never been extended to suits brought against a State, by the citizens of another State, or by aliens."</p>\n<p>The Court, however, chooses to ignore the clear meaning of the Constitution text based on speculation that the intentions of a few of the Framers and Ratifiers might have been otherwise.  The evidence available reveals that the views of Madison and Hamilton on the issue are at best ambiguous, <em>see</em> nn. <l=|483 12|="" 468fn2="" u.s.="">12 and <l=|483 13|="" 468fn2="" u.s.="">13, <em>supra,</em> and that Marshall\'s understanding runs directly counter to the Court\'s position.  Thus, the Eleventh Amendment only bars a federal suit initiated by citizens of another State.  Moreover, as Part III demonstrates, the Amendment only bars a particular type of federal suit -- an action based on diversity jurisdiction.</l=|483></l=|483></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In my view, the Eleventh Amendment applies only to diversity suits, and not to federal question or admiralty suits.  The parallel between the language in Article III\'s grant of diversity jurisdiction ("to Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another State . . . and between a State . . . and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects") and the language in the Eleventh Amendment ("any suit in law or equity . . . by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State") supports this view.  The Amendment prohibits federal jurisdiction over <em>all</em> such suits in law or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 483 U. S. 510</a></p><p> equity which are based on diversity jurisdiction.  Since Congress had not granted federal question jurisdiction to federal courts prior to the Amendment\'s ratification, the Amendment was not intended to restrict that type of jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the controversy among the Ratifiers cited by the Court today, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#480">483 U. S. 480</a></span>-484, involved only diversity suits.  Moreover, the Court recognizes that the immediate impetus for adoption of the Eleventh Amendment was <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html">Chisholm v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 2 Dall. 419 (1793).  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#484">483 U. S. 484</a></span>.  <em>Chisholm</em> was a diversity case brought in federal court upon a state cause of action against the State of Georgia by a citizen of South Carolina.  The Court relies on <em>Hans v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html">134 U. S. 1</a></span> (1890), to hold that the Eleventh Amendment bars Welch\'s suit in admiralty.</p>\n<p><em>Hans,</em> however, was a <em>federal question</em> suit brought by a Louisiana citizen against his own State.  Ignoring this fact, the Court in <em>Hans</em> relied on materials that primarily addressed the question of state sovereign immunity in diversity cases, and not on federal question or admiralty cases. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  It is plain from the face of the <em>Hans</em> opinion that the Court misunderstood those materials. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  In particular, the Court in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 483 U. S. 511</a></p><p> <em>Hans</em> heavily relied on two sources:  a statement by Hamilton in The Federalist No. 81 and the views of Justice Iredell, who wrote the dissent in <em>Chisholm.</em>  134 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html#12">134 U.

A close examination of both these sources indicates that they cannot serve as support for the holding of <em>Hans</em> or of the Court today.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court today relies on the same quotation of Hamilton in The Federalist No. 81 cited by the Court in <em>Hans.</em> <em>Compare</em> 134 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html#12">134 U.

But, in that passage, Hamilton was discussing cases of diversity jurisdiction, not of federal question jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>"It has been suggested that an assignment of the <em>public securities of one state to the citizens of another</em> would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities.  A suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation."</p>\n<p>The Federalist No. 81, p. 548 (J. Cooke ed.1961) (emphasis added).  In the ensuing discussion, Hamilton described the circumstances in which States can claim sovereign immunity.  He began with the general principle of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual <em>without its consent.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 483 U. S. 512</a></p><p> This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 548-549.</p>\n<p>Hamilton believed that the States surrendered at least part of their sovereign immunity when they agreed to the Constitution.  The States, however, retained their sovereign authority over state-created causes of action.</p>\n<p>"Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the states and the danger intimated must be merely ideal."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 549.  Thus, the States retained their sovereign authority over diversity suits involving the state assignment of public securities to citizens of other States.</p>\n<p>"A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us that there is no color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith.  The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.  To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe?  How could recoveries be enforced?  It is evident, that it could not be done without waging war against the contracting state; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication and in destruction of a preexisting right of the state governments, a power which would involve such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Hamilton therefore believed that States could not be sued in federal court by citizens to collect debts in diversity actions.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 483 U. S. 513</a></p><p> A careful reading of this passage demonstrates that it does not support the general principle of sovereign immunity against all suits brought by individuals against States, contrary to the Court\'s views in <em>Hans</em> and in the present case.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Hans</em> also heavily relied on the rationale stated by Justice Iredell in <em>Chisholm.</em>  The Court in <em>Chisholm</em> held that the case was within the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court.  The Eleventh Amendment was thereafter enacted with "vehement speed," displacing the <em>Chisholm</em> ruling.  <em>Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/682/case.html">337 U. S. 682</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/682/case.html#708">337 U. S. 708</a></span> (1949).  The dissent of Justice Iredell is generally regarded as embodying the rationale of the Eleventh Amendment by those who broadly construe it.  <em>See Hans v. Louisiana, supra,</em> at 12, 14, 18-19; <em>see also</em> Fletcher, 35 Stan.L.Rev. at 1077; Field, The Eleventh Amendment and Other Sovereign Immunity Doctrines:  Part One, 126 Pa.L.Rev. 515, 541 (1978).  Nevertheless, I think it plain that Justice Iredell\'s conception of state sovereign immunity <em>supports</em> the notion that States should not be immune from suit in federal court in federal question or admiralty cases.</p>\n<p>Justice Iredell\'s dissent focused on whether the States delegated part of their sovereignty to the Federal Government upon entering into the Union and agreeing to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>"Every State in the Union, in every instance where its sovereignty has not been delegated to the United States, I consider to be as completely sovereign as the United States are in respect to the powers surrendered.  The United States are sovereign as to all the powers of Government actually surrendered.  Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved."</p>\n<p>2 Dall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html#435">2 U. S. 435</a></span>.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 483 U. S. 514</a></p><p> Justice Iredell defined the powers surrendered by the States in terms of the authority that resides in the Congress and the Executive Branch.</p>\n<p>"The powers of the general Government, either of a Legislative or executive nature, or which particularly concern Treaties with Foreign Powers, do for the most part (if not wholly) affect individuals, and not States.  They require no aid from any State authority.  This is the great leading distinction between the old articles of confederation and the present constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>He then defined the "judicial power" of Article III.  Justice Iredell found that the federal judicial power "is of a peculiar kind" because of its hybrid nature.  <em>Ibid.</em>  His conception of state sovereign immunity centered on the dual sources of federal judicial authority.  First, he delineated the portion of federal jurisdiction that</p>\n<p>"is indeed commensurate with the ordinary Legislature and Executive powers of the general government, and the Power which concerns treaties."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  This category encompasses matters wholly within the federal sovereignty.  Justice Iredell plainly was describing the federal question and admiralty jurisdiction where federal courts have jurisdiction based on the federal subject matter of the cases. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 483 U. S. 515</a></p><p> Justice Iredell then stated:  "But [the judicial power] also goes further."  <em>Ibid.</em>  It was in the further extension of judicial power that the sovereign immunity of the States was implicated.  In diversity cases, the federal judiciary was not dealing with subject matter within the realm of federal sovereignty, but was instead providing a neutral forum for the resolution of state law issues over which the States had not given up their sovereignty.</p>\n<p>"Where certain parties are concerned, although the subject in controversy does not relate to any of the special objects of authority of the general Government, wherein the separate sovereignties of the States are blended in one common mass of supremacy, yet the general Government has a Judicial Authority in regard to such subjects of controversy, and the Legislature of the United States may pass all laws necessary to give such Judicial Authority its proper effect.  So far as States under the Constitution can be made legally liable to this authority, so far to be sure they are subordinate to the authority of the United States, and their individual sovereignty is in this respect limited.  But it is limited no farther than the necessary execution of such authority requires."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html#435">2 U. S. 435</a></span>-436.</p>\n<p>Justice Iredell was concerned with "the limit of our authority" in the diversity case before the Court, since</p>\n<p>"we can exercise no authority in the present instance consistently with the clear intention of the [Judiciary Act] but such as a proper State Court would have been at least competent to exercise at the time the act was passed."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html#436">2 U.

If it could, I think it is now maintainable here:  if it could not, I think, as the law stands at present, it is not maintainable. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html#437">2 U. S. 437</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thus, Justice Iredell\'s dissenting opinion rested on a conception of state sovereignty that justified the incorporation of the sovereign immunity doctrine through the state common law, but <em>only</em> in <em>diversity</em> suits.  His opinion traditionally has been cited as key to the underlying meaning of the Eleventh Amendment.  <em>See Hans v. Louisiana,</em> 134 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/case.html#12">134 U. S. 12</a></span>.  Yet it provides no more support for the result in <em>Hans</em> than does the plain language of the Eleventh Amendment. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>I will not repeat the exhaustive evidence presented in my dissent in <em>Atascadero</em> that further buttresses my view of the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  <em>See Atascadero,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/case.html#247">473 U.

Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/184/case.html">377 U. S. 184</a></span> (1964).

The Court instead concludes that Congress did not abrogate the sovereign immunity of States, because it did not express this intent in unmistakably clear language.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s departure from normal rules of statutory construction frustrates the will of Congress.  The Court\'s holding in <em>Parden</em> that Congress intended to abrogate the sovereign immunity of States in FELA has not been disturbed by Congress for the past two decades.  In FELA, Congress not only indicated that "every common carrier . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce," but also expressed in unequivocal language that the "action may be brought in a district court of the United States."  45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 51, 56.  The Court in <em>Parden</em> noted that the legislative history of FELA revealed that Congress meant to extend the scope to apply to "all commerce," without exception for state-owned carriers.  377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/184/case.html#187">377 U.

In my view, Congress abrogated state immunity to suits under FELA, a statute incorporated by the Jones Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Sound precedent should produce progeny whose subsequent application of principle in light of experience confirms the original wisdom.  Tested by this standard, <em>Hans</em> has proved to be unsound.  The doctrine has been unstable, because it lacks a textual anchor, an established historical foundation, or a clear rationale. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  We should not forget that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 483 U. S. 520</a></p><p> irrationality of the doctrine has its costs.  It has led to the development of a complex set of rules to avoid unfair results. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]  <em>See, e.g., Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U.

The doctrine, based on a notion of kingship, intrudes impermissibly on Congress\' lawmaking power.  I adhere to my belief that:</p>\n<p>"[T]he doctrine that has thus been created is pernicious.  In an era when sovereign immunity has been generally recognized by courts and legislatures as an anachronistic and unnecessary remnant of a feudal legal system, . . . the Court has aggressively expanded its scope.  If this doctrine were required to enhance the liberty of our people in accordance with the Constitution\'s protections, I could accept it.  If the doctrine were required by the structure of the federal system created by the Framers, I could accept it.  Yet the current doctrine intrudes on the ideal of liberty under law by protecting the States from the consequences of their illegal conduct.  And the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 483 U.

By clinging to <em>Hans,</em> the Court today erases yet another traditional legal distinction and overrules yet another principle that defined the limits of that decision.  In my view, we should at minimum confine <em>Hans</em> to its current domain.  More fundamentally, however, it is time to begin a fresh examination of Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence without the weight of that mistaken precedent.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, provides:</p>\n<p>"The judicial power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; -- to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; -- to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; -- to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; -- to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State; -- between Citizens of different States; -- between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>None of these Marshall Court cases casts any doubt on the correctness of <em>United States v.

The Court has applied normal rules of statutory construction when Congress exercises its authority under an Amendment that expressly contemplates limitations on States\' authority, <em>see Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/case.html">427 U.

S. 452</a></span>-453 (1976), despite the Eleventh Amendment\'s express jurisdictional bar against certain suits in law or equity.  <em>A fortiori,</em> we should apply normal statutory construction when Congress exercises its express authority to extend federal jurisdiction over admiralty cases and the Eleventh Amendment <em>does not expressly</em> bar the exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p>It seems odd for the Court to impose an "unmistakable language" requirement on the Jones Act, especially based on an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment that incorporates words that are not there.  Departing from normal rules of statutory construction inevitably will frustrate the will of Congress.  When the Jones Act was enacted, <em>Bright</em> was the prevailing precedent.  Moreover, in my view, Congress expressed its intent in unmistakable language when it extended liability to employers of "any seaman" and explicitly provided for federal jurisdiction over such actions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, as Part IV discusses, <em>infra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#517">483 U. S. 517</a></span>-519, we should be especially hesitant to incorporate the concept of state sovereign immunity with respect to those subjects over which the Constitution expressly grants authority to the National Government.  Foreign and interstate commerce, which necessarily encompasses matters of admiralty, is obviously such a subject area.  As we said in <em>United States v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html">297 U.

Language and objectives so plain are not to be thwarted by resort to a rule of construction whose purpose is but to resolve doubts, and whose application in the circumstances would be highly artificial."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html#186">297 U.

If, however, this proposed federal judicial jurisdiction were qualified by the doctrine of state immunity, a broad avenue would have been left open to defeat every claim made upon them by citizens of other states and by aliens.

And if a state has surrendered any portion of its sovereignty, the question whether a liability to suit be a part of this portion depends on the instrument by which the surrender is made.

No surprising discoveries about the historical record had been made in the decade of the 1880s.  The Justice himself merely rehashed the familiar quotations from Madison, Marshall, and Hamilton.  With regard to <em>Chisholm,</em> Bradley declaimed:"</p>\n<p>"In view of the manner in which that decision was received by the country, the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the light of history and the reason of the thing, we think we are at liberty to prefer Justice Iredell\'s views. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Yet Iredell\'s dissent was manhandled. . . .

In the first place, as to cases arriving under the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.  Here the state courts could not ordinarily possess a direct jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction over such cases could not exist in the state courts previous to the adoption of the constitution, and it could not afterwards be directly conferred on them; for the constitution expressly requires the judicial powers to be vested in courts ordained and established by the United States. . . .  The same remarks may be urged as to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls . . . and as to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. . . .

Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/276/case.html">423 U. S. 276</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/276/case.html#297">423 U. S. 297</a></span>-298 (1976) (overruling <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/29/case.html">Low v. Austin,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 29 (1872), because it ignored the language and objectives of the Import-Export Clause and misread earlier Court precedent).  Second, the progeny of <em>Hans</em> has produced erratic and irrational results.  If a general principle of state sovereign immunity is based on the sensitive problems inherent in making one sovereign appear against its will in the courts of other sovereigns, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#486">483 U. S. 486</a></span>-487, then it is inexplicable why States can be sued in some cases (by other States, by the Federal Government, or when prospective relief is sought) and not in other instances (by foreign countries, by citizens of the same State, or when retrospective relief is sought).  The Court\'s recital of the rules of sovereign immunity in <em>Monaco v. Mississippi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/case.html">292 U. S. 313</a></span> (1934), indicates the crazy-quilt pattern of the <em>Hans</em> doctrine.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/case.html#487">483 U. S. 487</a></span>.  Third, the Eleventh Amendment doctrine creates inconsistencies in constitutional interpretation.  For example, under the Seventh Amendment, the Court has stated that a right to a jury trial does not extend to admiralty cases because these suits in admiralty are distinguishable from suits in law.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/28/433/case.html">Parsons v. Bedford,</a></span></em> 3 Pet. 433,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/28/433/case.html#446">28 U. S. 446</a></span>-447 (1830).  Yet today the Court ignores the distinction between suits in admiralty and in law in arriving at its decision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>As Professor Orth concludes:</p>\n<p>"By the late twentieth century, the law of the Eleventh Amendment exhibited a baffling complexity. . . .  \'The case law of the eleventh amendment is replete with historical anomalies, internal inconsistencies, and senseless distinctions.\'  Marked by its history as were few other branches of constitutional law, interpretation of the Amendment has become an arcane specialty of lawyers and federal judges."</p>\n<p>Orth 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
