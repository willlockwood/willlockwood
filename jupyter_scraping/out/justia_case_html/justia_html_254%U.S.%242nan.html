S. 243</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Seeking to recover for supplies furnished and repairs made to the schooner <em>Francis McDonald,</em> appellant libeled the vessel in United States District Court, Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>Under a definite contract, the Palmer Shipbuilding Company began construction of the schooner at Groton, Connecticut, and launched the hull.  That company found itself unable to proceed further; thereupon appellant agreed with the owner to complete the work, and for such purpose, the hull was towed to its yard at New London.  While lying there in the stream, the materials, work, and labor for which recovery is now sought were furnished.  Later the vessel, so advanced, was towed to Hoboken and finished by a third company.  When received by appellant, the schooner was manifestly incomplete -- her masts were not in, the bolts and beams and gaff were lying on deck, the forward house was not built, and she was not "in condition to carry on any service."  Appellant worked on her for six weeks, and thirty or forty more days were required to finish her.</p>\n<p>Was appellant\'s contract to furnish the materials, work, and labor for her completion, made after the schooner was launched, but while yet not sufficiently advanced to discharge the functions for which intended, within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction?  The district court thought not, and so do we.</p>\n<p>Under decisions of this Court, the settled rule is that a contract for the complete construction of a ship or supplying materials therefor is nonmaritime, and not within the admiralty jurisdiction.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/393/case.html">People\'s Ferry Co. v.

S. 244</a></p><p> material to finish a vessel after she has been launched and is water-borne.  In support of this position, they rely upon <em>The Eliza Ladd,</em> (1875) Fed.Cas. No. 4364; <em>The Revenue Cutter,</em> (1877) Fed.Cas. No. 11,714 -- both by Judge Deady, in the United States District Court for Oregon; <em>The Manhattan,</em> District Court for Washington (1891), 46 F. 797, which followed the District Court for Oregon, and <em>Tucker v. Alexandroff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/183/424/case.html">183 U. S. 424</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/183/424/case.html#438">183 U. S. 438</a></span>.  The first three cases are directly in point, but are opposed by many of no less authority.  <em>Tucker v. Alexandroff</em> must be read in the light of the particular matter under consideration -- detention of a foreign seaman -- and the conclusion announced, that, after the vessel was launched "she was a ship within the meaning of the treaty."  The court had no immediate concern with contracts for ship construction, and there was no purpose to lay down any definite rule applicable to them.  On the other side, the following cases are cited, and they are entitled to the greater weight:  <em>The Tosco,</em> Fed.Cas. No. 7,060; <em>The Pacific,</em> 9 F. 120; <em>The Count de Lesseps,</em> 17 F. 460; <em>The Glenmont,</em> 32 F. 703 and 34 F. 403; <em>The Paradox,</em> 61 F. 860; <em>McMaster v.

It is said that in no proper sense can they be regarded as directly and immediately connected with navigation or commerce by water.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/532/case.html">Edwards v.
