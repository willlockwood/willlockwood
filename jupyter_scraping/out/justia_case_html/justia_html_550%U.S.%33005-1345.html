Facing an environmental crisis and an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, the Counties requested and the State created respondent Authority.  The Counties and the Authority agreed that the Authority would manage all solid waste in the Counties.  Private haulers could pick up citizens\xe2\x80\x99 trash, but the Authority would process, sort, and send it off for disposal.  The Authority would also provide other services, including recycling.  If the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s operating costs and debt service were not recouped through the \xe2\x80\x9ctipping fees\xe2\x80\x9d it charged, the Counties must make up the difference.  To avoid such liability, the Counties enacted \xe2\x80\x9cflow control\xe2\x80\x9d ordinances requiring private haulers to obtain permits to collect solid waste in the Counties and to deliver the waste to the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s sites.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, a trade association and individual haulers, filed suit under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the flow control ordinances violate the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce.  They submitted evidence that without the ordinances and the associated tipping fees, they could dispose of solid waste at out-of-state facilities for far less.  Ruling in the haulers\xe2\x80\x99 favor, the District Court held that nearly all flow control laws<em> </em>had been categorically rejected in <em>C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.</em> v. <em>Clarkstown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/383/index.html">511 U. S. 383</a>, where this Court held that an ordinance forcing haulers to deliver waste to a particular private facility discriminated against interstate commerce.  Reversing, the Second Circuit held that <em>Carbone</em> and other of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdormant\xe2\x80\x9d Commerce Clause precedents allow for a distinction between laws that benefit public, as opposed to private, facilities.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment is affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left">261 F.\xc2\xa03d 245 and 438 F.\xc2\xa03d 150, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II\xe2\x80\x93A, II\xe2\x80\x93B, and II\xe2\x80\x93C, concluding that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 flow control ordinances, which treat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones, do not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0To determine whether a law violates the dormant Commerce Clause, the Court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce.  In this context, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/index.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 99.  Discriminatory laws motivated by \xe2\x80\x9csimple economic protectionism\xe2\x80\x9d are subject to a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/index.html">437 U. S. 617</a>, 624, which can only be overcome by a showing that there is no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, <em>Maine</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/index.html">477 U. S. 131</a>, 138.  P.\xc2\xa06.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Carbone</em> does not control this case.  <em>Carbone</em> involved a flow control ordinance requiring that all nonhazardous solid waste within a town be deposited, upon payment of an above-market tipping fee, at a transfer facility run by a private contractor under an agreement with the town.  See 511 U. S., at 387.  The dissent there opined that the ostensibly private transfer station was \xe2\x80\x9cessentially a municipal facility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 419, and that this distinction should have saved the ordinance because favoring local government is different from favoring a particular private company.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comment on the public-private distinction does not prove, as the haulers\xe2\x80\x99 contend, that the majority agreed with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the facility, but thought there was no difference under the dormant Commerce Clause between laws favoring private entities and those favoring public ones.  Rather, the <em>Carbone </em>majority avoided the issue because the transfer station was private, and therefore the question whether <em>public</em> facilities may be favored was not properly before the Court.  The majority viewed the ordinance as \xe2\x80\x9cjust one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 391, citing six local processing cases involving discrimination in favor of <em>private </em>enterprise.  If the Court were extending this line of cases to cover discrimination in favor of local government, it could be expected to have said so.  Thus, <em>Carbone</em> cannot be regarded as having decided the public-private question.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The flow control ordinances in this case do not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>General Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Tracy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/278/index.html">519 U. S. 278</a>, 298, whereas government\xe2\x80\x99s important responsibilities to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens set it apart from a typical private business, cf. <em>id., </em>at 313.  Moreover, in contrast to laws favoring in-state business over out-of-state competition, which are often the product of economic protectionism, laws favoring local government may be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism.  Here, the ordinances enable the Counties to pursue particular policies with respect to waste handling and treatment, while allocating the costs of those policies on citizens and businesses according to the volume of waste they generate.  The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government.  The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 citizens could have left the entire matter of waste management services for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce.  But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort.  It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the voters\xe2\x80\x99 decision in this regard. The Court is particularly hesitant to interfere here because waste disposal is typically and traditionally a function of local government exercising its police power.  Nothing in the Commerce Clause vests the responsibility for such a policy judgment with the Federal Judiciary.  Finally, while the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dormant Commerce Clause cases often find discrimination when the burden of state regulation falls on interests outside the State, the most palpable harm imposed by the ordinances at issue\xe2\x80\x94more expensive trash removal\xe2\x80\x94will likely fall upon the very people who voted for the laws, the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 citizens.  There is no reason to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain through the political process.

In <em>C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.</em> v. <em>Clarkstown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/383/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/383/index.html">511 U. S. 383</a> (1994), this Court struck down under the Commerce Clause a flow control ordinance that forced haulers to deliver waste to a particular <em>private</em> processing facility.  In this case, we face flow control ordinances quite similar to the one invalidated in <em>Carbone</em>.  The only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation.  We find this difference constitutionally significant.  Disposing of trash has been a traditional government activity for years, and laws that favor the government in such areas\xe2\x80\x94but treat every private business, whether in-state or out-of-state, exactly the same\xe2\x80\x94do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the Commerce Clause.  Applying the Commerce Clause test reserved for regulations that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, we uphold these ordinances because any incidental burden they may have on interstate commerce does not outweigh the benefits they confer on the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Located in central New York, Oneida and Herkimer Counties span over 2,600 square miles and are home to about 306,000 residents.  Traditionally, each city, town, or village within the Counties has been responsible for disposing of its own waste.  Many had relied on local landfills, some in a more environmentally responsible fashion than others.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98crisis.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 4.  Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations.  Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars.  These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defen-\ndants in that case named over 600 local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis\xe2\x80\x9d extended beyond health and safety concerns.  The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime.  Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 notice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to these problems, the Counties requested and New York\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature and Governor created the Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority (Authority), a public benefit corporation.  See N.\xc2\xa0Y. Pub. Auth. Law Ann. \xc2\xa72049\xe2\x80\x93aa <em>et seq. </em>(West 1995).  The Authority is empowered to collect, process, and dispose of solid waste generated in the Counties.  \xc2\xa72049\xe2\x80\x93ee(4).  To further the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s governmental and public purposes, the Counties may impose \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate and reasonable limitations on competition\xe2\x80\x9d by, for instance, adopting \xe2\x80\x9clocal laws requiring that all solid waste \xe2\x80\xa6 be delivered to a specified solid waste management-resource recovery facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72049\xe2\x80\x93tt(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1989, the Authority and the Counties entered into a Solid Waste Management Agreement, under which the Authority agreed to manage all solid waste within the Counties.  Private haulers would remain free to pick up citizens\xe2\x80\x99 trash from the curb, but the Authority would take over the job of processing the trash, sorting it, and sending it off for disposal.  To fulfill its part of the bargain, the Authority agreed to purchase and develop facilities for the processing and disposal of solid waste and recyclables generated in the Counties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Authority collected \xe2\x80\x9ctipping fees\xe2\x80\x9d to cover its operating and maintenance costs for these facilities.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The tipping fees significantly exceeded those charged for waste removal on the open market, but they allowed the Authority to do more than the average private waste disposer.  In addition to landfill transportation and solid waste disposal, the fees enabled the Authority to provide recycling of 33 kinds of materials, as well as composting, household hazardous waste disposal, and a number of other services.  If the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s operating costs and debt service were not recouped through tipping fees and other charges, the agreement provided that the Counties would make up the difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As described, the agreement had a flaw: Citizens might opt to have their waste hauled to facilities with lower tipping fees.  To avoid being stuck with the bill for facilities that citizens voted for but then chose not to use, the Counties enacted \xe2\x80\x9cflow control\xe2\x80\x9d ordinances requiring\nthat all solid waste generated within the Counties be delivered to the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s processing sites.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Private haulers must obtain a permit from the Authority to collect waste in the Counties.  Penalties for noncompliance with the ordinances include permit revocation, fines, and\nimprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are United Haulers Association, Inc., a trade association made up of solid waste management companies, and six haulers that operated in Oneida and Herkimer Counties when this action was filed.  In 1995, they sued the Counties and the Authority under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the flow control laws violate the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce.  They submitted evidence that without the flow control laws and the associated $86-per-ton tipping fees, they could dispose of solid waste at out-of-state facilities for between $37 and $55 per ton, including transportation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court read our decision in <em>Carbone, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/383/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/383/index.html">511 U. S. 383</a>, as categorically rejecting nearly all flow control laws.  The court ruled in the haulers\xe2\x80\x99 favor, enjoining enforcement of the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 laws.  The Second Circuit reversed, reasoning that <em>Carbone</em> and our other dormant Commerce Clause precedents allow for a distinction between laws that benefit public as opposed to private facilities.  261 F.\xc2\xa03d 245, 263 (2001).  Accordingly, it held that a statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce when it favors local government at the expense of all private industry.  The court remanded to let the District Court decide whether the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 ordinances nevertheless placed an incidental burden on interstate commerce, and if so, whether the ordinances\xe2\x80\x99 benefits outweighed that burden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand and after protracted discovery, a Magistrate Judge and the District Court found that the haulers did not show that the ordinances imposed <em>any </em>cognizable burden on interstate commerce.  The Second Circuit affirmed, assuming that the laws exacted some toll on interstate commerce, but finding any possible burden \xe2\x80\x9cmodest\xe2\x80\x9d compared to the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and substantial\xe2\x80\x9d benefits of the ordinances.  438 F.\xc2\xa03d 150, 160 (2006).  Because the Sixth Circuit had recently issued a conflicting decision holding that a flow control ordinance favoring a public entity<em> does </em>facially discriminate against interstate commerce, see <em>National Solid Wastes Management Assn.</em> v. <em>Daviess Cty.</em>, 434 F.\xc2\xa03d 898 (2006), we granted certiorari, 548 U. S. ___ (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commerce Clause provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall have Power \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Although the Constitution does not in terms limit the power of States to regulate commerce, we have long interpreted the Commerce Clause as an implicit restraint on state authority, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute.

In this context, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/index.html">511 U.

In <em>Carbone</em>, the town of Clarkstown, New York, hired a private contractor to build a waste transfer station.  According to the terms of the deal, the contractor would operate the facility for five years, charging an above-market tipping fee of $81 per ton; after five years, the town would buy the facility for one dollar.  The town guaranteed that the facility would receive a certain volume of trash per year.  To make good on its promise, Clarkstown passed a flow control ordinance requiring that all nonhazardous solid waste within the town be deposited at the transfer facility.  See 511 U. S., at 387.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court struck down the ordinance, holding that it discriminated against interstate commerce by \xe2\x80\x9choard[ing] solid waste, and the demand to get rid of it, for the benefit of the preferred processing facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 392.  The dissent pointed out that all of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s local processing cases involved laws that discriminated in favor of <em>private </em>entities, not public ones.  <em>Id.,</em> at 411 (opinion of Souter, J.).  According to the dissent, Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s ostensibly private transfer station was \xe2\x80\x9cessentially a municipal facility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 419, and this distinction should have saved Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance because favoring local government is by its nature different from favoring a particular private company.  The majority did not comment on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s public-private distinction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties in this case draw opposite inferences from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s silence.  The haulers say it proves that the majority agreed with the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the facility, but thought there was no difference under the dormant Commerce Clause between laws favoring private entities and those favoring public ones.  The Counties disagree, arguing that the majority studiously avoided the issue because the facility in <em>Carbone </em>was private, and therefore the question whether <em>public</em> facilities may be favored was not properly before the Court.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe the latter interpretation of <em>Carbone</em> is correct.  As the Second Circuit explained, \xe2\x80\x9cin <em>Carbone</em> the Justices were divided over the <em>fact of whether </em>the favored facility was public or private, rather than on the import of that distinction.\xe2\x80\x9d  261 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 259 (emphasis in original).  The <em>Carbone </em>dissent offered a number of reasons why public entities should be treated differently from private ones under the dormant Commerce Clause.  See 511 U.

It is hard to suppose that the <em>Carbone </em>majority definitively rejected these arguments without explaining why.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Carbone</em> majority viewed Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s flow control ordinance as \xe2\x80\x9cjust one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 391.  It then cited six local processing cases, every one of which involved discrimination in favor of <em>private </em>enterprise.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s own description of the cases acknowledges that the \xe2\x80\x9coffending local laws hoard a local resource\xe2\x80\x94be it meat, shrimp, or milk\xe2\x80\x94for the benefit of <em>local businesses</em> that treat it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 392 (emphasis added).  If the Court were extending this line of local processing cases to cover discrimination in favor of local government, one would expect it to have said so.  Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 55, 165 (No. 14,693) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n opinion which is to \xe2\x80\xa6 establish a principle never before recognized, should be expressed in plain and explicit terms\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Carbone </em>majority stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>only conceivable distinction</em>\xe2\x80\x9d between the laws in the local processing cases and Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s flow control ordinance was that Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance favored a single local business, rather than a group of them.  511 U. S.<em>,</em> at 392 (emphasis added).  If the Court thought Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s processing facility was public, that additional distinction was not merely \xe2\x80\x9cconceivable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was conceived, and discussed at length, by three Justices in dissent.  <em>Carbone</em> cannot be regarded as having decided the public-private question.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flow control ordinances in this case benefit a clearly public facility, while treating all private companies exactly the same.  Because the question is now squarely presented on the facts of the case before us, we decide that such flow control ordinances do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors.  \xe2\x80\x9cConceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>General Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Tracy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/278/index.html">519 U. S. 278</a>, 298 (1997) (footnote omitted).  But States and municipalities are not private businesses\xe2\x80\x94far from it.  Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.  See <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/724/index.html">471 U. S. 724</a>, 756 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.  Cf. <em>Tracy</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 313 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x9d compels the conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cthat private marketers engaged in the sale of natural gas are similarly situated to public utility companies\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given these differences, it does not make sense to regard laws favoring local government and laws favoring private industry with equal skepticism.  As our local processing cases demonstrate, when a law favors in-state business over out-of-state competition, rigorous scrutiny is appropriate because the law is often the product of \xe2\x80\x9csimple economic protectionism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyoming</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/437/index.html">502 U. S. 437</a>, 454 (1992); <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey</em>,<em> </em>437 U. S., at 626\xe2\x80\x93627.  Laws favoring local government, by contrast, may be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism.  Here the flow control ordinances enable the Counties to pursue particular policies with respect to the handling and treatment of waste generated in the Counties, while allocating the costs of those policies on citizens and businesses according to the volume of waste they generate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government.  The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition.  In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities.  The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce.  But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort.  It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Maine</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 477 U. S., at 151.  See <em>Exxon Corp.</em> v. <em>Governor of Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/index.html">437 U. S. 117</a>, 127 (1978) (Commerce Clause does not protect \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular structure or method of operation\xe2\x80\x9d of a market).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We should be particularly hesitant to interfere with the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 efforts under the guise of the Commerce Clause because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]aste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function.\xe2\x80\x9d  261 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 264 (case below) (Calabresi, J., concurring); see <em>USA Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town of Babylon</em>, 66 F.\xc2\xa03d 1272, 1275 (CA2 1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor ninety years, it has been settled law that garbage collection and disposal is a core function of local government in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); M. Melosi, Garbage in the Cities: Refuse, Reform, and the Environment, 1880\xe2\x80\x931980, pp. 153\xe2\x80\x93155 (1981).  Congress itself has recognized local government\xe2\x80\x99s vital role in waste management, making clear that \xe2\x80\x9ccollection and disposal of solid wastes should continue to be primarily the function of State, regional, and local agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2797, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76901(a)(4).  The policy of the State of New York favors \xe2\x80\x9cdisplac[ing] competition with regulation or monopoly control\xe2\x80\x9d in this area.  N.\xc2\xa0Y. Pub. Auth. Law Ann. \xc2\xa72049\xe2\x80\x93tt(3).  We may or may not agree with that approach, but nothing in the Commerce Clause vests the responsibility for that policy judgment with the Federal Judiciary.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it bears mentioning that the most palpable harm imposed by the ordinances\xe2\x80\x94more expensive trash removal\xe2\x80\x94is likely to fall upon the very people who voted for the laws.  Our dormant Commerce Clause cases often find discrimination when a State shifts the costs of regulation to other States, because when \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of state regulation falls on interests outside the state, it is unlikely to be alleviated by the operation of those political restraints normally exerted when interests within the state are affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Southern Pacific Co.</em> v. <em>Arizona ex rel.

There is no reason to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain through the political process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 flow control ordinances, which treat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones, do not \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 flow control ordinances are properly analyzed under the test set forth in <em>Pike</em> v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/index.html"></a><a href="/us/397/137/index.html">397 U.

Under the <em>Pike </em>test, we will uphold a nondiscriminatory statute like this one \xe2\x80\x9cunless the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  397 U.

The Second Circuit alluded to, but did not endorse, a \xe2\x80\x9crather abstract harm\xe2\x80\x9d that may exist because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Counties\xe2\x80\x99 flow control ordinances have removed the waste generated in Oneida and Herkimer Counties from the national marketplace for waste processing services.\xe2\x80\x9d  438 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 160.  We find it unnecessary to decide whether the ordinances impose any incidental burden on interstate commerce because any arguable burden does not exceed the public benefits of the ordinances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ordinances give the Counties a convenient and effective way to finance their integrated package of waste-disposal services.  While \xe2\x80\x9crevenue generation is not a local interest that can justify <em>discrimination</em> against interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Carbone</em>,<em> </em>511 U. S., at 393 (emphasis added), we think it is a cognizable benefit for purposes of the <em>Pike </em>test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the ordinances are more than financing tools.  They increase recycling in at least two ways, conferring significant health and environmental benefits upon the citizens of the Counties.  First, they create enhanced incentives for recycling and proper disposal of other kinds of waste.  Solid waste disposal is expensive in Oneida-Herkimer, but the Counties accept recyclables and many forms of hazardous waste for free, effectively encouraging their citizens to sort their own trash.  Second, by requiring all waste to be deposited at Authority facilities, the Counties have markedly increased their ability to enforce recycling laws.  If the haulers could take waste to any disposal site, achieving an equal level of enforcement would be much more costly, if not impossible.  For these reasons, any arguable burden the ordinances impose on interstate commerce does not exceed their public benefits.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Counties\xe2\x80\x99 ordinances are exercises of the police power in an effort to address waste disposal, a typical and traditional concern of local government.  The haulers nevertheless ask us to hold that laws favoring public entities while treating all private businesses the same are subject to an almost <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity, because of asserted discrimination.  In the alternative, they maintain that the Counties\xe2\x80\x99 laws cannot survive the more permissive <em>Pike </em>test, because of asserted burdens on commerce.  There is a common thread to these arguments: They are invitations to rigorously scrutinize economic legislation passed under the auspices of the police power.  There was a time when this Court presumed to make such binding judgments for society, under the guise of interpreting the Due Process Clause.  See <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a> (1905).

It benefits a <em>public</em> <em>entity</em> performing a traditional local-government function and treats <em>all private entities</em> precisely the same way.  \xe2\x80\x9cDisparate treatment constitutes discrimination only if the objects of the disparate treatment are, for the relevant purposes, similarly situated.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</em> v. <em>Town of Harrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/564/index.html">520 U.

S. 383</a> (1994), I no longer believe it was correctly decided.  The negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.  See <em>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</em> v. <em>Town of Harrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/564/index.html">520 U.

As the debate between the majority and dissent shows, application of the negative Commerce Clause turns solely on policy considerations, not on the Constitution.  Because this Court has no policy role in regulating interstate commerce, I would discard the Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Commerce Clause, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall have Power \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.  The language of the Clause allows Congress not only to regulate interstate commerce but also to prevent state regulation of interstate commerce.  <em>State Bd. of Ins.</em> v. <em>Todd Shipyards Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/451/index.html">370 U. S. 451</a>, 456 (1962); <em>Gibbons</em> v. <em>Ogden</em>, 9 Wheat. 1, 210 (1824).  Expanding on the interstate-commerce powers explicitly conferred on Congress, this Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause as a tool for courts to strike down state laws that it believes inhibit interstate commerce.  But there is no basis in the Constitution for that interpretation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not contest this point, and simply begins its analysis by appealing to <em>stare decisis:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the Constitution does not in terms limit the power of States to regulate commerce, we have long interpreted the Commerce Clause as an implicit restraint on state authority, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute.  See Case of the State Freight Tax</em>, 15 Wall. 232, 279 (1873); <em>Cooley</em> v. <em>Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots</em>, 12 How. 299, 318 (1852).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Cooley</em> and <em>State Freight Tax</em> is curious because the Court has abandoned the reasoning of those cases in its more recent jurisprudence.  <em>Cooley</em> and <em>State Freight Tax</em> are premised upon the notion that the Commerce Clause is an exclusive grant of power to Congress over certain subject areas.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Cooley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319\xe2\x80\x93320 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever subjects of this [Commerce Clause] power are in their nature national, or admit only of one uniform system, or plan of regulation, may justly be said to be of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by [C]ongress\xe2\x80\x9d but holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of th[e] subject [of state pilotage laws] is not such as to require its exclusive legislation\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore upholding the state laws against the negative Commerce Clause challenge);<em> State Freight Tax</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 279\xe2\x80\x93280 (applying the same rationale).  The Court, however, no longer limits Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power by analyzing whether the subjects of state regulation \xe2\x80\x9cadmit only of one uniform system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cooley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319.  Rather, the modern jurisprudence focuses upon the way in which States regulate those subjects to decide whether the regulation is permissible.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6, 13.  Because the reasoning of <em>Cooley </em>and <em>State Freight Tax </em>has been rejected entirely, they provide no foundation for today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfazed, the Court proceeds to analyze whether the ordinances \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e] on [their] face against interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  Again, none of the cases the Court cites explains how the absence or presence of discrimination is relevant to deciding whether the ordinances are constitutionally permissible, and at least one case affirmatively admits that the nondiscrimination rule has no basis in the Constitution.  <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/index.html">437 U. S. 617</a>, 623 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe bounds of these restraints appear nowhere in the words of the Commerce Clause, but have emerged gradually in the decisions of this Court giving effect to its basic purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus cloaked in the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the Commerce Clause, the rule against discrimination that the Court applies to decide this case exists untethered from the written Constitution.  The rule instead depends upon the policy preferences of a majority of this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s policy preferences are an unsuitable basis for constitutional doctrine because they shift over time, as demonstrated by the different theories the Court has offered to support the nondiscrimination principle.  In the early years of the nondiscrimination rule, the Court struck down a state health law because \xe2\x80\x9cthe enactment of a similar statute by each one of the States composing the Union would result in the destruction of commerce among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Barber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/136/313/index.html">136 U. S. 313</a>, 321 (1890); see <em>Foster-Fountain Packing Co.</em> v. <em>Haydel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/278/1/index.html">278 U. S. 1</a>, 13 (1928) (stating that a Commerce Clause violation would occur if the state statute would \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly \xe2\x80\xa6 obstruct and burden interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d).  More recently, the Court has struck down state laws sometimes based on its preference for national unity, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/429/index.html">545 U.

S. 269</a>, 273 (1988) (stating that the negative Commerce Clause \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits economic protectionism\xe2\x80\x94that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Carbone</em>, 511 U. S., at 390 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Toomer</em> v. <em>Witsell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/334/385/index.html">334 U.

But the Constitution vests that fundamentally legislative choice in Congress.  To the extent that Congress does not exercise its authority to make that choice, the Constitution does not limit the States\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate commerce.  In the face of congressional silence, the States are free to set the balance between protectionism and the free market.  Instead of accepting this constitutional reality, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence gives nine Justices of this Court the power to decide the appropriate balance.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the foregoing demonstrates, despite more than 100 years of negative Commerce Clause doctrine, there is no principled way to decide this case under current law.  Notably, the Court cannot and does not consider this case \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n light of the language of the Constitution and the historical context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alden</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a>, 743 (1999).  Likewise, it cannot follow \xe2\x80\x9cthe cardinal rule to construe provisions in context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Balsys</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/666/index.html">524 U. S. 666</a>, 673 (1998).  And with no text to construe, the Court cannot take into account the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate choice of words\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctheir natural meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wright</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/583/index.html">302 U. S. 583</a>, 588 (1938).  Furthermore, as the debate between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and the dissent-\ning opinion reveals, no case law applies to the facts of\nthis case.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Explaining why the ordinances do not discriminate against interstate commerce, the Court states that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  According to the Court, a law favoring in-state business requires rigorous scrutiny because the law \xe2\x80\x9cis often the product of \xe2\x80\x98simple economic protectionism.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11.  A law favoring local government, however, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  This distinction is razor thin: In contrast to today\xe2\x80\x99s deferential approach (apparently based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s trust of local government), the Court has applied the equivalent of strict scrutiny in other cases even where it is unchallenged that the state law discriminated in favor of in-state private entities for a legitimate, nonprotectionist reason.  See <em>Barber</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 319 (striking down the State\xe2\x80\x99s inspection law for livestock even though it did not challenge \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he presumption that this statute was enacted, in good faith, \xe2\x80\xa6 to protect the health of the people of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Carbone</em>, which involved discrimination in favor of private entities, we did not doubt the good faith of the municipality in attempting to deal with waste through a flow-control ordinance.  511 U. S., at 386\xe2\x80\x93389.  But we struck down the ordinance because it did not allow interstate entities to participate in waste disposal.  <em>Id</em>., at 390\xe2\x80\x93395.  The majority distinguishes <em>Carbone</em> by deciding that favoritism of a government monopoly is less suspect than government regulation of private entities.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  I see no basis for drawing such a conclusion, which, if anything, suggests a policy-driven preference for government monopoly over privatization.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwaste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Whatever the reason, the choice is not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s to make.  Like all of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous negative Commerce Clause cases, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision leaves the future of state and local regulation of commerce to the whim of the Federal Judiciary.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite its acceptance of negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, the Court expresses concern about \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  It explains:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition.</p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain through the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11, 13.</p>\n<p align="left">\nI agree that the Commerce Clause is not a \xe2\x80\x9croving license\xe2\x80\x9d and that the Court should not deliver to businesses victories that they failed to obtain through the political process.  I differ with the Court because I believe its powerful rhetoric is completely undermined by the doctrine it\napplies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this regard, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analogy to <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a> (1905), suggests that the Court should reject the negative Commerce Clause, rather than tweak it.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  In <em>Lochner </em>the Court located a \xe2\x80\x9cright of free contract\xe2\x80\x9d in a constitutional provision that says nothing of the sort.  198 U. S., at 57.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, created from whole cloth, is just as illegitimate as the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d it vindicated in <em>Lochner</em>.  Yet today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not repudiate that doctrinal error.  Rather, it further propagates the error by narrowing the negative Commerce Clause for policy reasons\xe2\x80\x94reasons that later majorities of this Court may find to be entirely illegitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so doing, the majority revisits familiar territory: Just three years after <em>Lochner</em>, the Court narrowed the right of contract for policy reasons but did not overrule <em>Lochner</em>.  <em>Muller</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/412/index.html">208 U.

A local law that discriminates against interstate commerce is sustainable only if it serves a legitimate local purpose that could not be served as well by nondiscriminatory means.  <em>Maine</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/index.html">477 U.

S. 353</a>, 359 (1992).  Accordingly, laws that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate against [trash] by reason of its origin or destination out of State,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Carbone</em>, 511 U. S., at 390, are sustainable only if they serve a legitimate local purpose that could not be served as well by nondiscriminatory means.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Carbone, </em>this Court invalidated a local ordinance requiring all nonhazardous solid waste in Clarkstown, New York, to be deposited at a specific local transfer facility.  The Court concluded that the ordinance discriminated against interstate commerce because it \xe2\x80\x9choard[ed] solid waste, and the demand to get rid of it, for the benefit of the preferred processing facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 392.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court explained that the flow-control ordinance did serve a purpose that a nonprotectionist regulation would not: \xe2\x80\x9cIt ensures that the town-sponsored facility will be profitable, so that the local contractor can build it and Clarkstown can buy it back at nominal cost in five years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 393.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn other words \xe2\x80\xa6 the flow control ordinance is a financing measure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court concluded, however, that \xe2\x80\x9crevenue generation is not a local interest that can justify discrimination against interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also held that \xe2\x80\x9cClarkstown has any number of nondiscriminatory alternatives for addressing the health and environmental problems alleged to justify the ordinance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cuniform safety regulations\xe2\x80\x9d that could be enacted to \xe2\x80\x9censure that competitors \xe2\x80\xa6 do not underprice the market by cutting corners on environmental safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, the Court invalidated the ordinance because any legitimate local interests served by the ordinance could be accomplished through nondiscriminatory means.  See <em>id</em>., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case cannot be meaningfully distinguished from <em>Carbone</em>.  As the Court itself acknowledges, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he only salient difference\xe2\x80\x9d between the cases is that the ordinance invalidated in <em>Carbone</em> discriminated in favor of a privately owned facility, whereas the laws at issue here discriminate in favor of \xe2\x80\x9cfacilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  The Court relies on the distinction between public and private ownership to uphold the flow-control laws, even though a straightforward application of <em>Carbone</em> would lead to the opposite result.  See <em>ante,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  The public-private distinction drawn by the Court is both illusory and without precedent.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the flow control laws at issue discriminate in favor of a government-owned enterprise does not meaningfully distinguish this case from <em>Carbone</em>.  The preferred facility in <em>Carbone</em> was, to be sure, nominally owned by a private contractor who had built the facility on the town\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, but it would be misleading to describe the facility as private.  In exchange for the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s promise to build the facility for the town free of charge and then to sell it to the town five years later for $1, the town guaranteed that, during the first five years of the facility\xe2\x80\x99s existence, the contractor would receive \xe2\x80\x9ca minimum waste flow of 120,000 tons per year\xe2\x80\x9d and that the contractor could charge an above-market tipping fee.  511 U. S., at 387.  If the facility \xe2\x80\x9creceived less than 120,000 tons in a year, the town [would] make up the tipping fee deficit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  To prevent residents, businesses, and trash haulers from taking their waste elsewhere in pursuit of lower tipping fees (leaving the town responsible for covering any shortfall in the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s guaranteed revenue stream), the town enacted an ordinance \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] all nonhazardous solid waste within the town to be deposited at\xe2\x80\x9d the preferred facility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he object of this arrangement was to amortize the cost of the transfer station: The town would finance <em>its new facility</em> with the income generated by the tipping fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn other words,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe flow control ordinance [wa]s a financing measure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 393, for what everyone\xe2\x80\x94including the Court\xe2\x80\x94regarded as <em>the town\xe2\x80\x99s</em> new transfer station.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only real difference between the facility at issue in <em>Carbone</em> and its counterpart in this case is that title to the former had not yet formally passed to the municipality.  The Court exalts form over substance in adopting a test that turns on this technical distinction, particularly since, barring any obstacle presented by state law, the transaction in <em>Carbone</em> could have been restructured to provide for the passage of title at the beginning, rather than the end, of the 5-year period.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this very reason, it is not surprising that in <em>Carbone</em> the Court did not dispute the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s observation that the preferred facility was for all practical purposes owned by the municipality.  See <em>id.,</em> at 419 (opinion of Souter,\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cClarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s transfer station is essentially a municipal facility\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 416 (describing the nominal \xe2\x80\x9cproprietor\xe2\x80\x9d of the transfer station as \xe2\x80\x9cessentially an agent of the municipal government\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the contrary, the Court repeatedly referred to the transfer station in terms suggesting that the transfer station did in fact belong to the town.  See <em>id.,</em> at 387 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he town would finance <em>its</em> new facility with the income generated by the tipping fees\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>id</em>., at 393 (observing that the challenged flow-control ordinance was designed to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that the town-sponsored facility will be profitable\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 394 (concluding that, \xe2\x80\x9chaving elected to use the open market to earn revenues for <em>its</em> project, the town may not employ discriminatory regulation to give that project an advantage over rival businesses from out of State\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court dismisses those statements as \xe2\x80\x9cat best inconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa03.  The Court, however, fails to offer any explanation as to what other meaning could possibly attach to <em>Carbone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to Clarkstown\xe2\x80\x99s transfer station as a municipal facility.  It also ignores the fact that the ordinance itself, which was included in its entirety in an appendix to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, repeatedly referred to the station as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Town of Clarkstown solid waste facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 396, 398, 399.  The Court likewise fails to acknowledge that the parties in <em>Carbone</em> openly acknowledged the municipal character of the transfer station.  See Pet. for Cert., O. T. 1993, No. 92\xe2\x80\x931402, p.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>The town\xe2\x80\x99s</em> designated trash disposal facility is operated by a private contractor, under an agreement with the town\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Brief for Petitioner, O.

In suggesting otherwise, the Court relies unduly on <em>Carbone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s passing observation that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98offending local laws hoard a local resource\xe2\x80\x94be it meat, shrimp, or milk\xe2\x80\x94for the benefit of <em>local businesses</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (emphasis in original).  <em>Carbone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cbusinesses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court insists, somehow reveals that <em>Carbone </em>was not \xe2\x80\x9cextending\xe2\x80\x9d our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9cto cover discrimination in favor of local government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But no \xe2\x80\x9cexten[sion]\xe2\x80\x9d was required.  The Court has long subjected discriminatory legislation to strict scrutiny, and has never, until today, recognized an exception for discrimination in favor of a state-owned entity.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court long ago recognized that the Commerce Clause can be violated by a law that discriminates in favor of a state-owned monopoly.  In the 1890\xe2\x80\x99s, South Carolina enacted laws  giving a state agency the exclusive right to operate facilities selling alcoholic beverages within that State, and these laws were challenged under the Commerce Clause in <em>Scott </em>v<em>. Donald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/58/index.html">165 U. S. 58</a> (1897), and <em>Vance</em> v. <em>W.\xc2\xa0A. Vandercook Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/170/438/index.html">170 U. S. 438</a> (1898).  The Court held that the Commerce Clause barred the State from prohibiting its residents from purchasing alcohol from out-of-state vendors, see <em>id</em>., at 442, but that the State could surmount this problem by allowing residents to receive out-of-state shipments for their personal use.  See <em>id</em>., at 452.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding was based on the same fundamental dormant Commerce Clause principle applied in <em>Carbone</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As the Court put it in <em>Vance</em>, a State \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cannot discriminate against the bringing of [lawful] articles in and importing them from other States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because such discrimination is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a hindrance to interstate commerce and an unjust preference of the products of the enacting State as against similar products of other States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  170 U. S., at 443 (quoting <em>Scott</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 101).  Cf., <em>Carbone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 390 (the Commerce Clause bars state and local laws that \xe2\x80\x9cimpose commercial barriers or discriminate against an article of commerce by reason of its origin or destination out of State\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, were it not for the Twenty-first Amendment, laws creating state-owned liquor monopolies\xe2\x80\x94which many States maintain today\xe2\x80\x94would be deemed discriminatory under the dormant Commerce Clause.  See <em>Granholm</em> v. <em>Heald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/460/index.html"></a><a href="/us/544/460/index.html">544 U. S. 460</a>, 489 (2005) (explaining that the Twenty-first Amendment makes it possible for States to \xe2\x80\x9cassume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets\xe2\x80\x9d); see <em>id.,</em> at 517\xe2\x80\x93518 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting that, although laws creating a \xe2\x80\x9cstate monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d in the sale of liquor \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d against interstate commerce, they are \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the ambit of the Twenty-first Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d and are therefore immune from scrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause).  There is, of course, no comparable provision in the Constitution authorizing States to discriminate against out-of-state providers of waste processing and disposal services, either by means of a government-owned monopoly or otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor has this Court ever suggested that discriminatory legislation favoring a state-owned enterprise is entitled to favorable treatment.  To be sure, state-owned entities are accorded special status under the market-participant doctrine.  But that doctrine is not applicable here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the market-participant doctrine, a State is permitted to exercise \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98independent discretion as to parties with whom [it] will deal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reeves, Inc.</em> v. <em>Stake</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/index.html">447 U. S. 429</a>, 438\xe2\x80\x93439 (1980).  The doctrine thus allows States to engage in certain otherwise-discriminatory practices (<em>e.g.</em>, selling exclusively to, or buying exclusively from, the State\xe2\x80\x99s own residents), so long as the State is \xe2\x80\x9cacting as a market participant, <em>rather than as a market regulator</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>South-Central Timber Development, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wunnicke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/82/index.html">467 U. S. 82</a>, 93 (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are doing exactly what the market-participant doctrine says they cannot: While acting as market participants by operating a fee-for-service business enterprise in an area in which there is an established interstate market, respondents are also regulating that market in a discriminatory manner and claiming that their special governmental status somehow insulates them from a dormant Commerce Clause challenge.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents insist that the market-participant doctrine has no application here because they are not asserting a defense under the market-participant doctrine, Brief for Respondents 24\xe2\x80\x9325, but that argument misses the point.  Regardless of whether respondents can assert a defense under the market-participant doctrine, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases make clear that States cannot discriminate against interstate commerce unless they are acting solely as market participants.  Today, however, the Court suggests, contrary to its prior holdings, that States can discriminate in favor of in-state interests while acting both as a market participant <em>and</em> as a market regulator.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite precedent condemning discrimination in favor of government-owned enterprises, the Court attempts to develop a logical justification for the rule it creates today.  That justification rests on three principal assertions.  First, the Court insists that it simply \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not make sense to regard laws favoring local government and laws favoring private industry with equal skepticism,\xe2\x80\x9d because the latter are \xe2\x80\x9coften the product of \xe2\x80\x98simple economic protectionism,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (quoting <em>Wyoming</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/437/index.html">502 U. S. 437</a>, 454 (1992)), while the former \xe2\x80\x9cmay be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 11.  Second, the Court reasons that deference to legislation discriminating in favor of a municipal landfill is especially appropriate considering that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]aste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 12 (quoting 261 F.\xc2\xa03d 245, 264 (CA2 2001) (Calabresi, J., concurring)).  Third, the Court suggests that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 flow-control laws are not discriminatory because they \xe2\x80\x9ctreat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  I find each of these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I see no basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that discrimination in favor of an in-state facility owned by the government is likely to serve \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate goals unrelated to protectionism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Discrimination in favor of an in-state government facility serves \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98local economic interests,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Carbone</em>, 511 U. S., at 404 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Raymond Motor Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/429/index.html">434 U. S. 429</a>, 444, n.\xc2\xa018 (1978)), inuring to the benefit of local residents who are employed at the facility, local businesses that supply the facility with goods and services, and local workers employed by such businesses.  It is therefore surprising to read in the opinion of the Court that state discrimination in favor of a state-owned business is not likely to be motivated by economic protectionism.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Experience in other countries, where state ownership is more common than it is in this country, teaches that governments often discriminate in favor of state-owned businesses (by shielding them from international competition) precisely for the purpose of protecting those who derive economic benefits from those businesses, including their employees.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Such discrimination amounts to economic protectionism in any realistic sense of the term.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the same token, discrimination in favor of an in-state, privately owned facility may serve legitimate ends, such as the promotion of public health and safety.  For example, a State might enact legislation discriminating in favor of produce or livestock grown within the State, reasoning that the State\xe2\x80\x99s inspectors can more easily monitor the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and feed on farms within the State\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  Such legislation would almost certainly be unconstitutional, notwithstanding its potential to promote public health and safety.  See <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/index.html">437 U. S. 617</a>, 627 (1978)<em> </em>(noting that the Court has repeatedly invalidated legislation where \xe2\x80\x9ca presumably legitimate goal was sought to be achieved by the illegitimate means of isolating the State from the national economy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fallacy in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach can be illustrated by comparing a law that discriminates in favor of an in-state facility, owned by a corporation whose shares are publicly held, and a law discriminating in favor of an otherwise identical facility that is owned by the State or municipality.  Those who are favored and disfavored by these two laws are essentially the same with one major exception: The law favoring the corporate facility presumably benefits the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders, most of whom are probably not local residents, whereas the law favoring the government-owned facility presumably benefits the people of the enacting State or municipality.  I cannot understand why only the former law, and not the latter, should be regarded as a tool of economic protectionism.  Nor do I think it is realistic or consistent with our precedents to condemn some discriminatory laws as protectionist while upholding other, equally discriminatory laws as lawful measures designed to serve legitimate local interests unrelated to protectionism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I cannot accept the proposition that laws discriminating in favor of state-owned enterprises are so unlikely to be the product of economic protectionism that they should be exempt from the usual dormant Commerce Clause standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proper analysis under the dormant Commerce Clause involves more than an inquiry into whether the challenged Act is in some sense \xe2\x80\x9cdirected toward\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism\xe2\x80\x9d; equally important are the means by which those goals are realized.  If the chosen means take the form of a statute that discriminates against interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98either on its face or in practical effect\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden falls on [the enacting government] to demonstrate both that the statute \xe2\x80\x98serves a legitimate local purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 and that this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, 477 U. S., at 138 (quoting <em>Hughes</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/index.html">441 U. S. 322</a>, 336 (1979)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, if the legislative <em>means</em> are themselves discriminatory, then regardless of how legitimate and nonprotectionist the underlying legislative <em>goals</em> may be, the legislation is subject to strict scrutiny.  Similarly, the fact that a discriminatory law \xe2\x80\x9cmay [in some sense] be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism\xe2\x80\x9d does not make the law nondiscriminatory.  The existence of such goals is relevant, not to whether the law is discriminatory, but to whether the law can be allowed to stand even though it discriminates against interstate commerce.  And even then, the existence of legitimate goals is not enough; discriminatory legislation can be upheld only where such goals cannot adequately be achieved through nondiscriminatory means.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Philadelphia, supra</em>, at 626\xe2\x80\x93627 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends,\xe2\x80\x9d such that \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever [the State\xe2\x80\x99s] purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/333/index.html">432 U.

S. 349</a> (1951),<em> </em>is instructive on this point.  That case involved a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to an ordinance requiring all milk sold in Madison, Wisconsin, to be processed within five miles of the city\xe2\x80\x99s central square.  See <em>id</em>., at 350.  The ordinance \xe2\x80\x9cprofesse[d] to be a health measure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 354, and may have conferred some benefit on the city and its residents to the extent that it succeeded in guaranteeing the purity and quality of the milk sold in the city.  The Court nevertheless invalidated the ordinance, concluding that any public health benefits it may have conferred could be achieved through \xe2\x80\x9creasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d including a system that would allow a nonlocal dairy to qualify to sell milk in the city upon proving that it was in compliance with applicable health and safety requirements.  <em>Id</em>., at 354\xe2\x80\x93356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court did not inquire whether the real purpose of the ordinance was to benefit public health and safety or to protect local economic interests; nor did the Court make any effort to determine whether or to what extent the ordinance may have succeeded in promoting health and safety.  In fact, the Court apparently assumed that the ordinance could fairly be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9ca health measure.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id</em>., at 354.  The Court nevertheless concluded that the ordinance could not stand because it \xe2\x80\x9cerect[ed] an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the State,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ed] a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d and was \xe2\x80\x9cnot essential for the protection of local health interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 354, 356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The overarching concern expressed by the Court was that the ordinance, if left intact, \xe2\x80\x9cwould invite a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 356<em>.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder the circumstances here presented,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe regulation must yield to the principle that \xe2\x80\x98one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Baldwin</em> v. <em>G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/294/511/index.html"></a><a href="/us/294/511/index.html">294 U. S. 511</a>, 527 (1935)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same reasoning dooms the laws challenged here.  Like the ordinance in <em>Dean Milk</em>, these laws discriminate against interstate commerce (generally favoring local interests over nonlocal interests), but are defended on the ground that they serve legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism (<em>e.g.</em>, health, safety, and protection of the environment).  And while I do not question that the laws at issue in this case serve legitimate goals, the laws offend the dormant Commerce Clause because those goals could be attained effectively through nondiscriminatory means.  Indeed, no less than in <em>Carbone</em>, those goals could be achieved through \xe2\x80\x9cuniform [health and] safety regulations enacted without the object to discriminate\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwould ensure that competitors [to the municipal program] do not underprice the market by cutting corners on environmental safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U.

Respondents would also be free, of course, to \xe2\x80\x9csubsidize the[ir] [program] through general taxes or municipal bonds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 394.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut having elected to use the open market to earn revenues for\xe2\x80\x9d their waste management program, respondents \xe2\x80\x9cmay not employ discriminatory regulation to give that [program] an advantage over rival businesses from out of State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court next suggests that deference to legislation discriminating in favor of a municipal landfill is especially appropriate considering that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]aste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 12 (quoting 261 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 264 (Calabresi, J., concurring)).  I disagree on two grounds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, this Court has previously recognized that any standard \xe2\x80\x9cthat turns on a judicial appraisal of whether a particular governmental function is \xe2\x80\x98integral\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98traditional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Garcia</em> v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/index.html">469 U. S. 528</a>, 546\xe2\x80\x93547 (1985).  Indeed, the Court has <em>twice</em> experimented with such standards\xe2\x80\x94first in the context of intergovernmental tax immunity, see <em>South Carolina</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/199/437/index.html">199 U. S. 437</a> (1905), and more recently in the context of state regulatory immunity under the Commerce Clause, see <em>National League of Cities</em> v. <em>Usery</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/index.html">426 U. S. 833</a> (1976)\xe2\x80\x94only to abandon them later as analytically unsound.  See <em>Garcia, supra</em>, at 547 (overruling <em>National League of Cities</em>); <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/572/index.html">326 U. S. 572</a> (1946) (overruling <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>United States</em>).  Thus, to the extent today\xe2\x80\x99s holding rests on a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d governmental functions and their nontraditional counterparts, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, it cannot be reconciled with prior precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, although many municipalities in this country have long assumed responsibility for disposing of local garbage, see <em>Carbone, supra</em>, at 419\xe2\x80\x93420, and n.\xc2\xa010 (Souter,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting), most of the garbage produced in this country is still managed by the private sector.  See Brief for National Solid Wastes Management Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>22 (\xe2\x80\x9cToday, nearly two-thirds of solid waste received at landfills is received at private sector landfills\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> </em>R.\xc2\xa0W. Beck, Inc. et\xc2\xa0al., Size of the United States Solid Waste Industry, p. ES\xe2\x80\x933 (Apr. 2001) (study sponsored by the Environmental Research and Education Foundation) (noting that in 1999, 69.2% of the solid waste produced in the United States was managed by privately owned businesses).  In that respect, the Court is simply mistaken in concluding that waste disposal is \xe2\x80\x9ctypically\xe2\x80\x9d a local government function.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, especially considering the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>General Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Tracy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/278/index.html">519 U. S. 278</a>, 298 (1997)), a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d municipal landfill is for present purposes entirely different from a monopolistic landfill supported by the kind of discriminatory legislation at issue in this case and in <em>Carbone</em>.  While the former may be rooted in history and tradition, the latter has been deemed unconstitutional until today.  See <em>Carbone, supra</em>, at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.  It is therefore far from clear that the laws at issue here can fairly be described as serving a function \xe2\x80\x9ctypically and traditionally\xe2\x80\x9d performed by local governments.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally unpersuasive is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the flow-control laws do not discriminate against interstate commerce because they \xe2\x80\x9ctreat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Again, the critical issue is whether the challenged legislation discriminates against interstate commerce.  If it does, then regardless of whether those harmed by it reside entirely outside the State in question, the law is subject to strict scrutiny.  Indeed, this Court has long recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a burden imposed by a State upon interstate commerce is not to be sustained simply because the statute imposing it applies alike to the people of all the States, including the people of the State enacting such statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brimmer</em> v. <em>Rebman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/138/78/index.html">138 U.
