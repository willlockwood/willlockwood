Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read \xc2\xa7282 to require a defendant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which claims an improved method for editing computer documents.  After i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the patent was invalid under \xc2\xa7102(b)\xe2\x80\x99s on-sale bar, which precludes patent protection for any \xe2\x80\x9cinvention\xe2\x80\x9d that was \xe2\x80\x9con sale in this country\xe2\x80\x9d more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.  The parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent application, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the invention claimed in i4i\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Microsoft objected to i4i\xe2\x80\x99s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity defense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  The District Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s alternative instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence standard.  The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent and had failed to prove the patent\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity.  The Federal Circuit affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of \xc2\xa7282.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s contention that a defendant need only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof, its choice generally controls.  <em>Steadman</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/index.html">450 U. S. 91</a>, 95.  Congress has made such a choice here.  While \xc2\xa7282 includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Congress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the \xe2\x80\x9cterm \xe2\x80\xa6 comes with a common law meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/47/index.html">551 U. S. 47</a>, 58.  Here, by stating that a patent is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed valid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7282, Congress used a term with a settled common-law meaning.  <em>Radio Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/1/index.html">293 U. S. 1</a> <em>(RCA)</em>, is authoritative.  There, tracing nearly a century of case law, the Court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 2. Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing standard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the absence of those qualifications from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases.  Also unpersuasive is Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation must fail because it renders superfluous \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s additional statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity \xe2\x80\xa6 shall rest on the party asserting\xe2\x80\x9d it.  The canon against superfluity assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to every clause and word of a statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174.  Here, no interpretation of \xc2\xa7282 avoids excess language because, under either of Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s alternative theories\xe2\x80\x94that the presumption only allocates the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of production and persuasion\xe2\x80\x94the presumption itself would be unnecessary in light of \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s additional statement as to the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s burden.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a preponderance standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder was not before the PTO during the examination process.  It is true enough that, in these circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rationale underlying the presumption\xe2\x80\x94that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the claim\xe2\x80\x94seems much diminished,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>KSR Int\xe2\x80\x99l Co.</em> v. <em>Teleflex Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/398/index.html">550 U. S. 398</a>, 426, though other rationales may still animate the presumption.  But the question remains whether Congress has specified the applicable standard of proof.  As established here today, Congress did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent validity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s fluctuating standard of proof.  And they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense.  In fact, the Court indicated to the contrary.  See <em>RCA,</em> 293 U. S., at 8.  Finally, the Court often applied the heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the relevant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/216/index.html">301 U. S. 216</a>, 227, 233.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s text suggests that Congress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case.  Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it presumably would have said so expressly.  Those pre-Act cases where various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weakened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment may lose significant force.  Cf. <em>KSR</em>, 550 U. S., at 427.  Consistent with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp. 14\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.  Congress specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of patent validity.  During the nearly 30 years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted \xc2\xa7282 as the Court does today, Congress has often amended \xc2\xa7282 and other patent laws, but apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard of proof.  Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Government and without.  Accordingly, any recalibration of the standard of proof remains in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 hands.

We hold that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08, Congress has charged the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task of examining patent applications, 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72(a)(1), and issuing patents if \xe2\x80\x9cit appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7131.  Congress has set forth the prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO must evaluate in the examination process.  To receive patent protection a claimed invention must, among other things, fall within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter, \xc2\xa7101, and be novel, \xc2\xa7102, and nonobvious, \xc2\xa7103.  Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of \xc2\xa7102(b) precludes patent protection for any \xe2\x80\x9cinvention\xe2\x80\x9d that was \xe2\x80\x9con sale in this country\xe2\x80\x9d more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.  See generally <em>Pfaff</em> v. <em>Wells Electronics, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/55/index.html">525 U. S. 55</a>, 67\xe2\x80\x9368 (1998).  In evaluating whether these and other statutory conditions have been met, PTO examiners must make various factual determinations\xe2\x80\x94for instance, the state of the prior art in the field and the nature of the advancement embodied in the invention.  See <em>Dickinson</em> v. <em>Zurko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/150/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>50, 153 (1999).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to its holder, including the exclusive right to use the invention during the patent\xe2\x80\x99s duration.  To enforce that right, a patentee can bring a civil action for infringement if another person \xe2\x80\x9cwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(a); see also \xc2\xa7281.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among other defenses under \xc2\xa7282 of the Patent Act of 1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the invalidity of the patent\xe2\x80\x94that is, he may attempt to prove that the patent never should have issued in the first place.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7282(2), (3).  A defendant may argue, for instance, that the claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus that one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.  See \xc2\xa7282(2); see also \xc2\xa7103.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graham</em> v. <em>John Deere Co.\nof Kansas City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/1/index.html">383 U.

Judge Rich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this view for the court in <em>American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co.</em> v. <em>Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, 725 F.\xc2\xa02d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984).  There, the Federal Circuit held that \xc2\xa7282 codified \xe2\x80\x9cthe existing presumption of validity of patents,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1359 (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94what, until that point, had been a common-law presumption based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic proposition that a government agency such as the [PTO] was presumed to do its job,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1952 precedent as to the \xe2\x80\x9cforce of the presumption,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>Radio Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/293/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/293/1/index.html">293 U.

The i4i patent claims an improved method for editing computer documents, which stores a document\xe2\x80\x99s content separately from the metacodes asso-ciated with the document\xe2\x80\x99s structure.  In 2007, i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement, claiming that Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s manufacture and sale of certain Microsoft Word products infringed i4i\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  In addition to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that i4i\xe2\x80\x99s patent was invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that the on-sale bar of \xc2\xa7102(b) rendered the patent invalid, pointing to i4i\xe2\x80\x99s prior sale of a software program known as S4.  The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to the filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4\nin the United States.  They presented opposing arguments to the jury, however, as to whether that software embodied the invention claimed in i4i\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  Because the software\xe2\x80\x99s source code had been destroyed years before the commencement of this litigation, the factual dispute turned largely on trial testimony by S4\xe2\x80\x99s two inventors\xe2\x80\x94also the named inventors on the i4i patent\xe2\x80\x94both of whom testified that S4 did not practice the key invention disclosed in the patent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was never presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected to i4i\xe2\x80\x99s proposed instruction that it was required to prove its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.

There, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court and others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2.  Although the \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d of the presumption found \xe2\x80\x9cvarying expression\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court and elsewhere, <em>id.</em>, at 7, Justice Cardozo explained, one \xe2\x80\x9ccommon core of thought and truth\xe2\x80\x9d unified the decisions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where the assailant connects himself in some way with the title of the true inventor, it is so <em>a fortiori</em> where he is a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of his own.  If it is true where the assailant launches his attack with evidence different, at least in form, from any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent, it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is\neven verbally the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 8 (internal citation omitted).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe common-law presumption, in other words, reflected the universal understanding that a preponderance standard of proof was too \xe2\x80\x9cdubious\xe2\x80\x9d a basis to deem a patent invalid.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id.</em>, at 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] patent \xe2\x80\xa6 is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, by the time Congress enacted \xc2\xa7282 and declared that a patent is \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed valid,\xe2\x80\x9d the presumption of patent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.

That is, the presumption encompassed not only an allocation of the burden of proof but also an imposition of a heightened standard of proof.  Under the general rule that a common-law term comes with its\ncommon-law meaning, we cannot conclude that Congress intended to \xe2\x80\x9cdrop\xe2\x80\x9d the heightened standard proof from\nthe presumption simply because \xc2\xa7282 fails to reiterate it expressly.  <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U.

But given how judges, including Justice Cardozo, repeatedly understood and explained the presumption of patent validity, we cannot accept Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Congress used the words \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed valid\xe2\x80\x9d to adopt only a procedural device for \xe2\x80\x9cshifting the burden of production,\xe2\x80\x9d or for \xe2\x80\x9cshifting both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (emphasis deleted).  Whatever the significance of a presumption in the abstract, basic principles of statutory construction require us to assume that Congress meant to incorporate \xe2\x80\x9cthe cluster of ideas\xe2\x80\x9d attached to the common-law term it adopted.  <em>Beck</em>, 529 U.

First, according to Microsoft, the heightened standard of proof applied in cases \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving oral testimony of prior invention,\xe2\x80\x9d simply to account for the unreliability of such testimony.  Brief for Petitioner 25.  Second, Microsoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof applied to \xe2\x80\x9cinvalidity challenges based on priority of invention,\xe2\x80\x9d where that issue had previously been litigated\nbetween the parties in PTO proceedings.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Squint as we may, we fail to see the qualifications that Microsoft purports to identify in our cases.  They certainly make no appearance in <em>RCA</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the presumption of patent validity.  <em>RCA</em> simply said, without qualification, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.\xe2\x80\x9d  293 U.

Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express limitations on the application of the heightened standard of proof.  Cf., <em>e.g., Smith</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/216/index.html">301 U.

In fact, Microsoft itself admits that our cases \xe2\x80\x9ccould be read as announcing a heightened standard applicable to all invalidity assertions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s proposed limitations are inherent\xe2\x80\x94even if unexpressed\xe2\x80\x94in our\npre-1952 cases.  As early as 1874 we explained that the burden of proving prior inventorship \xe2\x80\x9crests upon [the de-fendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him,\xe2\x80\x9d without tying that rule to the vagaries and manipulability of oral testimony.  <em>Coffin</em> v. <em>Ogden</em>, 18 Wall. 120, 124 (1874).  And, more than 60 years later, we applied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior-use defense included documentary proof\xe2\x80\x94not just oral testimony\xe2\x80\x94in a case presenting no priority issues at all.  See <em>Smith</em>, 301 U. S., at 221, 233.  Thus, even if Congress searched for some unstated limitations on the heightened standard of proof in our cases, it would have found none.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Microsoft also argues that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] patent shall be pre-sumed valid\xe2\x80\x9d must fail because it renders superfluous\nthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s additional statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent \xe2\x80\xa6 shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.\xe2\x80\x9d  We agree that if the presumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on the patent challenger, then it alone suffices to establish that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion.

The question remains, however, whether Congress has specified the applicable standard of proof.  As established, Congress did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent validity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind of fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions.  And they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To the contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in <em>RCA</em>, stating that because the heightened standard of proof applied where the evidence before the court was \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d from that considered by the PTO, it applied even more clearly where the evidence was identical.  293 U.

Likewise, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a \xe2\x80\x9cdubious preponderance\xe2\x80\x9d will never suffice to sustain an invalidity defense, <em>ibid.</em>, admitted of no apparent exceptions.  Finally, this Court often applied the heightened standard of proof without any mention of whether the relevant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Smith</em>, 301 U.

Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO\xe2\x80\x94and thus to take the unusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard of proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf. <em>Santosky</em> v. <em>Kramer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/index.html">455 U.

But we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest that a preponderance standard would apply in such circumstances, and we decline to impute such a reading to Congress.  Instead, we understand these cases to reflect the same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit has recognized throughout its existence\xe2\x80\x94namely, that new evidence supporting an invalidity defense may \xe2\x80\x9ccarry more weight\xe2\x80\x9d in an infringement action than evidence previously considered by the PTO, <em>American Hoist</em>, 725 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1360.  As Judge Rich explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen new evidence touching validity of the patent not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal considering it is not faced with having to disagree with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or with taking its expertise into account.

Cf. <em>KSR</em>, 550 U. S., at 427.  And, concomitantly, the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain.  In this respect, although we have no occasion to endorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury instruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when requested, most often should be given.  When warranted, the jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard evidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate before granting the patent.  When it is disputed whether the evidence presented to the jury differs from that evaluated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider that question.  In either case, the jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mendenhall </em>v.<em> Cedarapids, Inc.</em>, 5 F.\xc2\xa03d 1557, 1563\xe2\x80\x931564 (CA Fed. 1993); see\nalso Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 31\xe2\x80\x9337.

Moreover, Congress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d patents, including by expanding the reexamination process to provide for <em>inter partes</em> proceedings.

Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in \xc2\xa7282 has gone untouched.  Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa7282 in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Government and without.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress specified the applicable standard of proof\nin 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of patent validity.

As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98burden of proof\xe2\x80\x99 is one of the \xe2\x80\x98the slipperiest members of\nthe family of legal terms.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Schaffer</em> v. <em>Weast</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/49/index.html">546 U. S. 49</a>, 56 (2005) (quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \xc2\xa7342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (alteration omitted)).  Historically, the term has encompassed two separate burdens: the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d (specifying which party loses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the \xe2\x80\x9cburden of production\xe2\x80\x9d (specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various stages in the litigation).  <em>Ibid.</em>  Adding more confusion, the term \xe2\x80\x9cburden of proof\xe2\x80\x9d has occasionally been used as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Grogan</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/279/index.html">498 U. S. 279</a>, 286 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\nHere we use \xe2\x80\x9cburden of proof\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably with \xe2\x80\x9cburden of persuasion\xe2\x80\x9d to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to prevail.  We use the term \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of proof\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to the degree of certainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclusion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion.  See <em>Addington</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/index.html">441 U. S. 418</a>, 423 (1979).  In other words, the term \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of proof\xe2\x80\x9d specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing the burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor.  Various standards of proof are familiar\xe2\x80\x94beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence.  See generally 21B C. Wright &amp; K.

In sup-port, it relies on the \xe2\x80\x9cunderstanding\xe2\x80\x9d reflected in Federal Rule of Evidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in federal civil actions.  That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by nearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952 understood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of pat-ent validity.  In any event, the word \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d has often been\nused when another term might be more accurate.  See Thayer 335 (\xe2\x80\x9cOften \xe2\x80\xa6 maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of a presumption perversely and inaccurately\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, to the extent Congress used the words \xe2\x80\x9cpresumed valid\xe2\x80\x9d in an imprecise way, we cannot fault it for following our lead.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled presumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952.  Microsoft points to a handful of district court decisions, which \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[ed] whether any presumption of validity was warranted,\xe2\x80\x9d or which \xe2\x80\x9crequired the patentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e.g., Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc.</em>, 72 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 43, 44 (SDNY 1947) (stating, in dicta, that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t may now well be said that no presumption whatever arises from the grant of patent\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>post, </em>at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  <em>RCA </em>makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent validity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century, <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/293/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/293/1/index.html">293 U.

Microsoft may be correct that Congress enacted \xc2\xa7282 to correct lower courts that required the patentee to prove the validity of a patent.  See <em>American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co.</em> v. <em>Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, 725 F.\xc2\xa02d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).  But the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify that the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that the evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7282 provides additional evidence that Congress meant to codify the judge-made presumption of validity, not to set forth a new presumption of\nits own making.  The accompanying House and Senate Reports both explain that \xc2\xa7282 \xe2\x80\x9cintroduces a declaration of the presumption of va-lidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci-sions, but has had no expression in the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

To the same effect, the Reviser\xe2\x80\x99s Note indicates that \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst paragraph declares the existing presumption of validity of patents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Note following 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7282 (1952 ed.).</p>\n<p>\n\nPrior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum and substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it\xe2\x80\x94that is, they \xe2\x80\x9cassign[ed] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused infringer,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted).  See 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa769 (1946 ed.)

Rep., at 10; S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 9.  Thus, because the only thing missing from \xc2\xa7282\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor was the heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood the presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard of proof attached to it.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Microsoft cites numerous court of appeals decisions as support for its claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that the evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by the PTO.  We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft advocates in these cases.  Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that the court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened standard of proof.
