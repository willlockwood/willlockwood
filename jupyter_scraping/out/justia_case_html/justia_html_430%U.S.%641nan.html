S. 642</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented by our grant of certiorari is whether, under the circumstances of this case, federal criminal statutes violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by subjecting individuals to federal prosecution by virtue of their status as Indians.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>On the night of February 18, 1974, respondents, enrolled Coeur d\'Alene Indians, broke into the home of Emma Johnson, an 81-year-old non-Indian, in Worley, Idaho; they robbed and killed Mrs. Johnson.  Because the crimes were committed by enrolled Indians within the boundaries of the Coeur d\'Alene Indian Reservation, respondents were subject to federal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  They were, accordingly, indicted by a federal grand jury on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 430 U. S. 643</a></p><p> charges of burglary; robbery, and murder. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent William Davison was convicted of second-degree murder only.  Respondents Gabriel Francis Antelope and Leonard Davison were found guilty of all three crimes as charged, including first-degree murder under the felony murder provisions of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] as made applicable to enrolled Indians by 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, respondents contended that their felony murder convictions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 430 U. S. 644</a></p><p> were unlawful as products of invidious racial discrimination.  They argued that a non-Indian charged with precisely the same offense, namely the murder of another non-Indian within Indian country, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] would have been subject to prosecution only under Idaho law, which, in contrast to the federal murder statute, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111, does not contain a felony murder provision. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  To establish the crime of first-degree murder in state court, therefore, Idaho would have had to prove premeditation and deliberation.  No such elements were required under the felony murder component of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111.</p>\n<p>Because of the difference between Idaho and federal law, the Court of Appeals concluded that respondents were "put at a serious racially based disadvantage," 523 F.2d 400, 406 (1975), since the Federal Government was not required to establish premeditation and deliberation in respondents\' federal prosecution.  This disparity, so the Court of Appeals concluded, violated equal protection requirements implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We granted the United States\' petition for certiorari, 424 U.S. 907 (1976), and we reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 430 U. S. 645</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>(3)\n</em></p>\n<p>The decisions of this Court leave no doubt that federal legislation with respect to Indian tribes, although relating to Indians as such, is not based upon impermissible racial classifications.  Quite the contrary, classifications expressly singling out Indian tribes as subjects of legislation are expressly provided for in the Constitution [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and supported by the ensuing history of the Federal Government\'s relations with Indians.</p>\n<p>"Indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v.

If these laws . . . were deemed invidious racial discrimination, an entire Title of the United States Code (25 U.S.C.) would be effectively erased. . . ."</p>\n<p>In light of that result, the Court unanimously concluded in <em>Mancari:</em></p>\n<p>"The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of <em>quasi</em>-sovereign tribal entities. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/case.html#554">417 U.

Unlike <em>Mancari,</em> the Indian plaintiffs in <em>Fisher</em> were being denied a benefit or privilege available to non-Indians; nevertheless, a unanimous Court dismissed the claim of racial discrimination:</p>\n<p>"[W]e reject the argument that denying [the Indian plaintiffs] access to the Montana courts constitutes impermissible racial discrimination.

But the principles reaffirmed in <em>Mancari</em> and <em>Fisher</em> point more broadly to the conclusion that federal regulation of Indian affairs is not based upon impermissible classifications.  Rather, such regulation is rooted in the unique status of Indians as "a separate people," with their own political institutions.  Federal regulation of Indian tribes, therefore, is governance of once-sovereign political communities; it is not to be viewed as legislation of a "<em>racial\' group consisting of </em></p><h3><em>I</em></h3><em>ndians.\' . . ."  <em>Morton v.

Not all crimes committed within Indian country are subject to federal or tribal jurisdiction, however.  Under <em>United States v. McBratney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/104/621/case.html">104 U. S. 621</a></span> (1882), a non-Indian charged with committing crimes against other non-Indians in Indian country is subject to prosecution under state law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111 is the federal murder statute.  It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.  Every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree."</p>\n<p>"Any other murder is murder in the second degree."</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that respondent William Davison was convicted only of second-degree murder, not felony murder, under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  Federal law ostensibly extends federal jurisdiction to all crimes occurring in Indian country, except offenses subject to tribal jurisdiction.  18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1152.  However, under <em>United States v. McBratney, supra,</em> and cases that followed, this Court construed \xc2\xa7 1152 and its predecessors as not applying to crimes by non-Indians against other non-Indians.  Thus, respondents correctly argued that, had the perpetrators of the crimes been non-Indians, the courts of Idaho would have had jurisdiction over these charges.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Idaho statutes contain the following definition of first-degree murder:</p>\n<p>"All murder which is perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing is murder of the first degree.

Moreover, members of tribes whose official status has been terminated by congressional enactment are no longer subject, by virtue of their status, to federal criminal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act.  <em>United States v. Heath,</em> 509 F.2d 16, 19 (CA9 1974) ("While, anthropologically, a Klamath Indian, even after the Termination Act, obviously remains an Indian, his unique status <em>vis-a-vis</em> the Federal Government no longer exists").  In addition, as enrolled tribal members, respondents were subjected to federal jurisdiction only because their crimes were committed within the confines of Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1151.  Crimes occurring elsewhere would not be subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction.  <em>Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/392/case.html">391 U.

Ives,</em> 504 F.2d 935, 953 (CA9 1974) (dicta).  Since respondents are enrolled tribal members, we are not called on to decide whether nonenrolled Indians are subject to 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153, and we therefore intimate no views on the matter.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Other than their argument that the federal statutes create an invidious racial classification, respondents do not seriously contend that application of federal law to Indian tribes is so irrational as to deny equal protection.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, <em>infra.</em>  They do point, however, to Congress\' relinquishment of criminal jurisdiction over Indians in six States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1162.  But \xc2\xa7 1162 is simply one manifestation of Congress\' continuing concern with the welfare of Indian tribes under federal guardianship.  Indeed, in adopting \xc2\xa7 1162, Congress singled out certain reservations to remain subject to federal criminal jurisdiction.  Congress\' selective approach in \xc2\xa7 1162 reinforces, rather than undermines, the conclusion that legislation directed toward Indian tribes is a necessary and appropriate consequence of federal guardianship under the Constitution.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Federal jurisdiction would extend to crimes, regardless of the race of the perpetrator or victim, committed on federal enclaves, such as military installations, or on vessels of the United States on the high seas.</p>\n<p>Congress has provided for federal jurisdiction over the crime of murder on a reservation, much as on other federal enclaves, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1111, 1153.

Federal statutes do not single out Indians as such; non-Indian defendants are also covered if the victim was a member of the tribe.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents base their equal protection claim on the assumption that they have been disadvantaged by being prosecuted under federal law.  In their view, their murder convictions were made more likely by the fact that federal prosecutors were not required to prove premeditation.  However, they do not seriously question that the evidence adduced at their federal trial might well have supported a finding of premeditation and deliberation, since respondents were found to have beaten and kicked Mrs. Johnson to death during the course of a planned robbery.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>It should be noted, however, that this Court has consistently upheld federal regulations aimed solely at tribal Indians, as opposed to all persons subject to federal jurisdiction.  <em>See, e.g.,   <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/407/case.html">70 U.

Indeed, the Constitution itself provides support for legislation directed specifically at the Indian tribes.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F6" name="T6">n</a> 6, <em>supra.</em>  As the Court noted in <em>Morton v. Mancari,</em> the Constitution therefore "singles Indians out as a proper subject for separate legislation."  417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/535/case.html#552">417 U.

Big Crow,</em> 523 F.2d 955 (CA8 1975), <em>cert. denied,</em> 424 U.S. 920 (1976), and <em>United States v. Cleveland,</em> 503 F.2d 1067 (CA9 1974), <em>with United States v. Analla,</em> 490 F.2d 1204 (CA10), <em>vacated and remanded,</em> 419 U.S. 813 (1974).  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153 (1976 ed.) (which provides for uniform penalties for both Indians and non-Indians charged with assault resulting in serious bodily injury).  That issue is not before us, and we intimate no views on it.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, had respondents been prosecuted under state law, they may well have argued, under this Court\'s holding in <em>Seymour v. Superintendent,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/351/case.html">368 U. S. 351</a></span> (1962), that the state conviction was void for want of jurisdiction.  In <em>Seymour,</em> an enrolled member of the Colville Indian Tribe was convicted in state court of attempted burglary within Indian country.  In reversing the state conviction, this Court held:</p>\n<p>"Since the burglary with which petitioner was charged occurred on property . . . within the . . . [Indian] reservation, the courts of Washington had no jurisdiction to try him for that offense."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/351/case.html#359">368 U.

The Constitution does not authorize this kind of gamesmanship.  Indeed, any such rule, even assuming its workability, is flatly inconsistent with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, Art VI, cl. 2.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
