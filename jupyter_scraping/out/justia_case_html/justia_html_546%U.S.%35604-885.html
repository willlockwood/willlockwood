In this case, a proceeding commenced by respondent Bankruptcy Trustee under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7547(b) and 550(a) to avoid and recover alleged preferential transfers by the debtor to petitioner state agencies, the agencies claim that the proceeding is barred by sovereign immunity.  The Bankruptcy Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motions to dismiss on that ground, and the District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed based on the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s prior determination that Congress has abrogated the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A bankruptcy trustee\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding to set aside the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s preferential transfers to state agencies is not barred by sovereign immunity.

Although statements in <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html">517 U. S. 44</a>, reflect an assumption that that case\xe2\x80\x99s holding would apply to the Clause, careful study and reflection convince this Court that that assumption was erroneous.  The Court is not bound to follow its dicta in a prior case in which the point at issue was not fully debated.  <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 399\xe2\x80\x93400.

S., at 448.  Petitioners here, like the state agency parties in <em>Hood</em>, have conceded as much.  See <em>id.</em>, at 449.  The history of discharges in bankruptcy proceedings demonstrates that these concessions, and <em>Hood</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, are correct.  The Framers\xe2\x80\x99 primary goal in adopting the Clause was to prevent competing sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 interference with discharge: The patchwork of wildly divergent and uncoordinated insolvency and bankruptcy laws that existed in the American Colonies resulted in one jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s imprisoning debtors discharged (from prison and of their debts) in and by another jurisdiction.  The absence of extensive debate at the Convention over the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s text or its insertion into the Constitution indicates that there was general agreement on the importance of authorizing a uniform federal response to the problems and injustice that system created.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Bankruptcy jurisdiction, as understood today and at the framing, is principally <em>in rem</em>.  See, <em>e.g., Hood</em>, 541 U. S., at 447.  It thus does not implicate States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty to nearly the same degree as other kinds of jurisdiction.  See <em>id., </em>at 450\xe2\x80\x93451.  The Framers would have understood the Bankruptcy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s grant of power to enact laws on the entire \xe2\x80\x9csubject of Bankruptcies\xe2\x80\x9d to include laws providing, in certain limited respects, for more than simple adjudications of rights in the res.  Courts adjudicating disputes concerning bankrupts\xe2\x80\x99 estates historically have had the power to issue ancillary orders enforcing their <em>in rem</em> adjudications.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 455\xe2\x80\x93456.  The interplay between <em>in rem </em>adjudications and orders ancillary thereto is also evident in this case.  Whether or not actions such as this are properly characterized as <em>in rem, </em>those who crafted the Bankruptcy Clause would have understood it to give Congress the power to authorize courts to avoid preferential transfers and to recover the transferred property.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Insofar as orders ancillary to the bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x99 <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction, like orders directing turnover of preferential transfers, implicate States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity from suit, the States agreed in the plan of the Constitutional Convention not to assert that immunity.  That is evidenced not only by the Bankruptcy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s history, but also by legislation considered and enacted in the immediate wake of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ratification.  For example, the Bankruptcy Act of 1800 specifically granted federal courts habeas authority to release debtors from state prisons at a time when state sovereign immunity was preeminent among the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, yet there appears to be no record of any objection to that grant based on an infringement of sovereign immunity.  This history demonstrates that the power to enact bankruptcy legislation was understood to carry with it the power to subordinate state sovereignty, albeit within a limited sphere.  Pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0The Court need not consider the question <em>Hood </em>left open: whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cabrogat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d state sovereign immunity in 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7106(a) is valid.  The relevant question is not abrogation, but whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that States should be amenable to preferential transfer proceedings is within the scope of its power to enact \xe2\x80\x9cLaws on the subject of Bankruptcies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Beyond peradventure, it is.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power, at its option, either to treat States in the same way as other creditors or exempt them from the operation of bankruptcy laws arises from the Clause itself; the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cabrogation\xe2\x80\x9d is the one effected in the plan of the Convention, not by statute.

Without reaching that question, we upheld the application of the Bankruptcy Code to proceedings initiated by a debtor against a state agency to determine the dischargeability of a student loan debt.  See <em>id.</em>, at 451.  In this case we consider whether a proceeding initiated by a bankruptcy trustee to set aside preferential transfers by the debtor to state agencies is barred by sovereign immunity.

(2000 ed. and Supp. III), in the United\xc2\xa0States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.  Respondent, Bernard Katz, is the court-appointed liquidating supervisor of the bankrupt estate.  He has commenced proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7547(b) and 550(a) to avoid and recover alleged preferential transfers to each of the petitioners made by the debtor when it was insolvent.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motions to dismiss those proceedings on the basis of sovereign immunity were denied by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The denial was affirmed by the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the authority of the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s prior determination that Congress has abrogated the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings.  See <em>Hood </em>v. <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation</em> <em>(In\xc2\xa0re Hood)</em>, 319 F.\xc2\xa03d 755 (2003).  We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. ___ (2005), to consider the question left open by our opinion in <em>Hood:</em>  whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to abrogate state sovereign immunity in 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7106(a)[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] is valid.  As we shall explain, however, we are persuaded that the enactment of that provision was not necessary to authorize the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over these preference avoidance proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bankruptcy jurisdiction, at its core, is <em>in rem</em>.  See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/329/565/index.html"></a><a href="/us/329/565/index.html">329 U.

As we noted in <em>Hood</em>, it does not implicate States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty to nearly the same degree as other kinds of jurisdiction.  See 541 U. S., at 450\xe2\x80\x93451 (citing admiralty and bankruptcy cases).  That was as true in the 18th century as it is today.  Then, as now, the jurisdiction of courts adjudicating rights in the bankrupt estate included the power to issue compulsory orders to facilitate the administration and distribution of the res<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is appropriate to presume that<em> </em>the Framers of the Constitution were familiar with the contemporary legal context when they adopted the Bankruptcy Clause[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]\xe2\x80\x94a provision which, as we explain in Part IV, <em>infra</em>, reflects the States\xe2\x80\x99 acquiescence in a grant of congressional power to subordinate to the pressing goal of harmonizing bankruptcy law sovereign immunity defenses that might have been asserted in bankruptcy proceedings.  The history of the Bankruptcy Clause, the reasons it was inserted in the Constitution, and the legislation both proposed and enacted under its auspices immediately following ratification of the Constitution demonstrate that it was intended not just as a grant of legislative authority to Congress, but also to authorize limited subordination of state sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy arena.  Foremost on the minds of those who adopted the Clause were the intractable problems, not to mention the injustice, created by one State\xe2\x80\x99s imprisoning of debtors who had been discharged (from prison and of their debts) in and by another State.  As discussed below, to remedy this problem, the very first Congresses considered, and the Sixth Congress enacted, bankruptcy legislation authorizing federal courts to, among other things, issue writs of habeas corpus directed at state officials ordering the release of debtors from state prisons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We acknowledge that statements in both the majority and the dissenting opinions in <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html">517 U. S. 44</a> (1996), reflected an assumption that the holding in that case would apply to the Bankruptcy Clause.  See also <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/96/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/96/index.html">492 U. S. 96</a>, 105 (1989) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  Careful study and reflection have convinced us, however, that that assumption was erroneous.   For the reasons stated by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821), we are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated.  See <em>id.</em>, at 399\xe2\x80\x93400 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Local Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/234/index.html">292 U. S. 234</a>, 244 (1934).  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder our longstanding precedent, States, whether or not they choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound by a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s discharge order no less than other creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hood</em>, 541 U. S., at 448.  Petitioners here, like the state agencies that were parties in <em>Hood</em>, have conceded as much.  See <em>id.</em>, at 449 (noting concession that \xe2\x80\x9cStates are generally bound by a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s discharge order\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Oct. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history of discharges in bankruptcy proceedings demonstrates that the state agencies\xe2\x80\x99 concessions, and <em>Hood</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, are correct.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge\xe2\x80\x9d historically had a dual meaning; it referred to both release of debts and release of the debtor from prison.  Indeed, the earliest English statutes governing bankruptcy and insolvency authorized discharges of persons, not debts.  One statute enacted in 1649 was entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAn act for discharging Poor Prisoners unable to satisfy their creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642\xe2\x80\x931660, pp. 240\xe2\x80\x93241 (C. Firth &amp; R. Rait eds. 1911).  The stated purpose of the Act was to \xe2\x80\x9cDischarge\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 the person of [the] Debtor\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cof and from his or her Imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Not until 1705 did the English Parliament extend the discharge (and then only for traders and merchants) to include release of debts.  See 4 Ann., ch. 17, \xc2\xa77 (providing that upon compliance with the statute, \xe2\x80\x9call and every person and persons so becoming bankrupt . . . shall be discharged from all debts by him, her, or them due and owing at the time that he, she, or they did become bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d); see also McCoid, Discharge: The Most Important Development in Bankruptcy History, 70 Am. Bankr. L.\xc2\xa0J. 163, 167 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well into the 18th century, imprisonment for debt was still ubiquitous in England[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and the American Colonies.  Bankruptcy and insolvency laws remained as much concerned with ensuring full satisfaction of creditors (and, relatedly, preventing debtors\xe2\x80\x99 flight to parts unknown[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]) as with securing new beginnings for debtors.  Illustrative of bankruptcy laws\xe2\x80\x99 harsh treatment of debtors during this period was that debtors often fared worse than common criminals in prison; unfortunate insolvents, unlike criminals, were forced to provide their own food, fuel, and clothing while behind bars.  See B. Mann, Republic of Debtors: Bankruptcy in the Age of American Independence 78\xe2\x80\x93108 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Common as imprisonment itself was, the American Colonies, and later the several States, had wildly divergent schemes for discharging debtors and their debts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 79 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe only consistency among debt laws in the eighteenth century was that every colony, and later every state, permitted imprisonment for debt\xe2\x80\x94most on <em>mesne</em> process, and all on execution of a judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  At least four jurisdictions offered relief through private Acts of their legislatures.  See <em>Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn. </em>v. <em>Gibbons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/457/index.html">455 U. S. 457</a>, 472 (1982). Those Acts released debtors from prison upon surrender of their property, and many coupled the release from prison with a discharge of debts.  Other jurisdictions enacted general laws providing for release from prison and, in a few places, discharge of debt.  Others still granted release from prison, but only in exchange for indentured servitude.  Some jurisdictions provided no relief at all for the debtor.  See generally P. Coleman, Debtors and Creditors in America: Insolvency, Imprisonment for Debt, and Bankruptcy, 1607\xe2\x80\x931900 (1999).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The difficulties posed by this patchwork of insolvency and bankruptcy laws were peculiar to the American experience.  In England, where there was only one sovereign, a single discharge could protect the debtor from his jailer and his creditors.  As two cases\xe2\x80\x94one litigated before the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and one litigated after it\xe2\x80\x94demonstrate, however, the uncoordinated actions of multiple sovereigns, each laying claim to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s body and effects according to different rules, rendered impossible so neat a solution on this side of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the first case, <em>James </em>v. <em>Allen</em>, 1 Dall. 188 (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1786), Jared Ingersoll, an attorney who a year later would become a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  represented a Pennsylvania creditor seeking recovery from a debtor who had been released from prison in New Jersey.  Shortly after his release, the debtor traveled to Pennsylvania, where he was arrested for nonpayment of the Pennsylvania debt.  In seeking release from the Pennsylvania prison, he argued that his debt had been discharged by the New Jersey court.  Ingersoll responded that the order granting relief under New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s insolvency laws \xe2\x80\x9conly discharged the person of the debtor from arrest within the State of New Jersey.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  The court agreed: Whatever effect the order might have had in New Jersey, the court said, it \xe2\x80\x9cgoes no further than to discharge [the debtor] from his imprisonment in the Gaol of Essex County in the State of New Jersey; which, if the fullest obedience were paid to it, could not authorize a subsequent discharge from imprisonment in another Gaol, in another State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 192.  The court further observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nsolvent laws subsist in every State in the Union, and are probably all different from each other \xe2\x80\xa6 .\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even the Bankrupt Laws of England, while we were the subjects of that country, were never supposed to extend here, so as to exempt the persons of the Bankrupts from being arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 191.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the second case,<em> Millar </em>v. <em>Hall</em>, 1 Dall. 229 (Pa. 1788), which was decided the year after the Philadelphia Convention, Ingersoll found himself arguing against the principle announced in <em>James</em>.  His client, a debtor named Hall, had been \xe2\x80\x9cdischarged under an insolvent law of the state of Maryland, which is in the nature of a general bankrupt[cy] law.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Dall., at 231.  Prior to his discharge, Hall had incurred a debt to a Pennsylvanian named Millar.  Hall neglected to mention that debt in his schedule of creditors presented to the Maryland court, or to personally notify Millar of the looming discharge.  Following the Maryland court\xe2\x80\x99s order, Hall traveled to Pennsylvania and was promptly arrested for the unpaid debt to Millar.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to Millar\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the holding of <em>James</em> controlled, Ingersoll urged adoption of a rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of the Defendant in one state ought to be sufficient to discharge [a debtor] in every state.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Dall., at 231.  Absent such a rule, Ingersoll continued, \xe2\x80\x9cperpetual imprisonment must be the lot of every man who fails; and all hope of retrieving his losses by honest and industrious pursuits, will be cut off from the unfortunate bankrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court accepted this argument.  Allowing a creditor to execute \xe2\x80\x9cupon [a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] person out of the state in which he has been discharged,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be giving a superiority to some creditors, and affording them a double satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94to wit, a proportionable dividend of his property there, and the imprisonment of his person here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 232.  Indeed, the debtor having already been obliged to surrender all of his effects, \xe2\x80\x9cto permit the taking [of] his person here, would be to attempt to compel him to perform an impossibility, that is, to pay a debt after he has been deprived of every means of payment,\xe2\x80\x94an attempt which would, at least, amount to perpetual imprisonment, unless the benevolence of his friends should interfere to discharge [his] account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These two cases illustrate the backdrop against which the Bankruptcy Clause was adopted.  In both <em>James</em> and <em>Millar</em>, the debtors argued that the earlier discharge should be given preclusive effect pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Articles of Confederation.  See <em>James</em>, 1 Dall., at 190; <em>Millar</em>, 1 Dall., at 231.  That possibility was the subject of discussion at the Constitutional Convention when a proposal to encompass legislative Acts, and insolvency laws in particular, within the coverage of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution was committed to the Committee of Detail[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] together with a proposal \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]o establish uniform laws upon the subject of bankruptcies, and respecting the damages arising on the protest of foreign bills of exchange.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See Nadelmann, On the Origin of the Bankruptcy Clause, 1 Am. J. Legal Hist. 215, 216\xe2\x80\x93217, 219 (1957); see also Plank, The Constitutional Limits of Bankruptcy, 63 Tenn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 487, 527\xe2\x80\x93528 (1996).  A few days after this proposal was taken under advisement, the Committee of Detail reported that it had recommended adding the power \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]o establish uniform laws upon the subject of bankruptcies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the Naturalization Clause of what later became Article I.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Convention adopted the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation with very little debate two days later.  Roger Sherman of Connecticut alone voted against it, apparently because he was concerned that it would authorize Congress to impose upon American citizens the ultimate penalty for debt then in effect in England: death.  See J. Madison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 571 (Ohio Univ. Press ed. 1966).  The absence of extensive debate over the text of the Bankruptcy Clause or its insertion indicates that there was general agreement on the importance of authorizing a uniform federal response to the problems presented in cases like <em>James</em> and <em>Millar</em>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bankruptcy jurisdiction, as understood today and at the time of the framing, is principally <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction.

The first bankruptcy statute, for example, gave bankruptcy commissioners appointed by the district court the power, <em>inter alia</em>, to imprison recalcitrant third parties in possession of the estate\xe2\x80\x99s assets.  See Bankruptcy Act of 1800, \xc2\xa714, 2 Stat. 25 (repealed 1803).  More generally, courts adjudicating disputes concerning bankrupts\xe2\x80\x99 estates historically have had the power to issue ancillary orders enforcing their <em>in rem</em> adjudications.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 486 (1766) (noting that the assignees of the bankrupt\xe2\x80\x99s property\xe2\x80\x94the 18th-century counterparts to today\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy trustees\xe2\x80\x94could \xe2\x80\x9cpursue any <em>legal </em>method of recovering [the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] property so vested in them,\xe2\x80\x9d and could pursue methods in equity with the consent of the creditors); Plank, 63 Tenn.

As the dissenters in that case pointed out, it was at least arguable that the particular procedure that the debtor pursued to establish dischargeability of her student loan could have been characterized as a suit against the State rather than a purely <em>in rem</em> proceeding.  See 541 U. S., at 455\xe2\x80\x93456 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  But because the proceeding was merely ancillary to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction, we held that it did not implicate state sovereign immunity.  The point is also illustrated by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 early grant to federal courts of the power to issue <em>in personam</em> writs of habeas corpus directing States to release debtors from state prisons, discussed in Part IV, <em>infra</em>.  See <em>Braden </em>v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html">410 U. S. 484</a>, 494\xe2\x80\x93495 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the person who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interplay between <em>in rem </em>adjudications and orders ancillary thereto is evident in the case before us.  Respondent first seeks a determination under 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7547 that the various transfers made by the debtor to petitioners qualify as voidable preferences.  The \xc2\xa7547 determination, standing alone, operates as a mere declaration of avoidance.  That declaration may be all that the trustee wants; for example, if the State has a claim against the bankrupt estate, the avoidance determination operates to bar that claim until the preference is turned over.  See \xc2\xa7502(d).  In some cases, though, the trustee, in order to marshal the entirety of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estate, will need to recover the subject of the transfer pursuant to \xc2\xa7550(a).  A court order mandating turnover of the property, although ancillary to and in furtherance of the court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction, might itself involve <em>in personam </em>process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explain in Part IV, <em>infra</em>, it is not necessary to decide whether actions to recover preferential transfers pursuant to \xc2\xa7550(a) are themselves properly characterized as <em>in rem</em>.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Whatever the appropriate appellation, those who crafted the Bankruptcy Clause would have understood it to give Congress the power to authorize courts to avoid preferential transfers and to recover the transferred property.  Petitioners do not dispute that that authority has been a core aspect of the administration of bankrupt estates since at least the 18th century.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Cooper</em>, 2 Cowp. 629, 633\xe2\x80\x93634, 98 Eng. Rep. 1277, 1280 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1777); <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Temple</em>, 1 Black.

And it, like the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus releasing debtors from state prisons, see Part IV, <em>infra</em>, operates free and clear of the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Insofar as orders ancillary to the bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x99 <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction, like orders directing turnover of preferential transfers, implicate States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity from suit, the States agreed in the plan of the Convention not to assert that immunity.  So much is evidenced not only by the history of the Bankruptcy Clause, which shows that the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 primary goal was to prevent competing sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 interference with the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s discharge, see Part II, <em>supra</em>, but also by legislation considered and enacted in the immediate wake of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ratification.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress considered proposed legislation establishing uniform federal bankruptcy laws in the first and each succeeding Congress until 1800, when the first Bankruptcy Act was passed.  See C. Warren, Bankruptcy in United States History 10 (1935) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the very first session of the 1st Congress, during which only the most necessary subjects of legislation were considered, bankruptcy was one of those subjects; and as early as June 1, 1789, a Committee of the House was named to prepare a bankruptcy bill\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Bankruptcy Act of 1800 was in many respects a copy of the English bankruptcy statute then in force.  It was, like the English law, chiefly a measure designed to benefit creditors.  Like the English statute, its principal provisions permitted bankruptcy commissioners, on appointment by a federal district court, to arrest the debtor, see \xc2\xa74, 2 Stat. 22; to \xe2\x80\x9ccause the doors of the dwelling-house of [the] bankrupt to be broken,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74, <em>id.</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324; to seize and collect the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets, \xc2\xa75, <em>id</em>., at 23; to examine the debtor and any individuals who might have possession of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s property, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714, 18, 19, <em>id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9327; and to issue a \xe2\x80\x9ccertificate of discharge\xe2\x80\x9d once the estate had been distributed, \xc2\xa736, <em>id.</em>, at 31.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The American legislation differed slightly from the English, however.  That difference reflects both the uniqueness of a system involving multiple sovereigns and the concerns that lay at the core of the Bankruptcy Clause itself.  The English statute gave a judge sitting on a court where the debtor had obtained his discharge the power to order a sheriff, \xe2\x80\x9cBailiff or Officer, Gaoler or Keeper of any Prison\xe2\x80\x9d to release the \xe2\x80\x9cBankrupt out of Custody\xe2\x80\x9d if he were arrested subsequent to the discharge.  5 Geo. 2, ch. 30, \xc2\xb613 (1732).  The American version of this provision was worded differently; it specifically granted federal courts the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus effective to release debtors from state prisons.  See \xc2\xa738, 2 Stat. 32; see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Comstock</em>, 6 F. Cas. 237, 239 (No. 3,073) (Vt. 1842) (observing that Bankruptcy Act of 1800, then repealed, would have granted a federal court the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus to release a debtor from state prison if he had been arrested following his bankruptcy discharge).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This grant of habeas power is remarkable not least because it would be another 67 years, after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, before the writ would be made generally available to state prisoners.  See <em>Ex parte Royall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/117/241/index.html">117 U. S. 241</a>, 247 (1886).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Moreover, the provision of the 1800 Act granting that power was considered and adopted during a period when state sovereign immunity could hardly have been more prominent among the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.  <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, 2 Dall. 419, the case that had so \xe2\x80\x9cshock[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the country in its lack of regard for state sovereign immunity, <em>Principality of Monaco </em>v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/index.html">292 U. S. 313</a>, 325 (1934), was decided in 1793.  The ensuing five years that culminated in adoption of the Eleventh Amendment were rife with discussion of States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty and their amenability to suit.  Yet there appears to be no record of any objection to the bankruptcy legislation or its grant of habeas power to federal courts based on an infringement of sovereign immunity.  See Haines 184\xe2\x80\x93185.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This history strongly supports the view that the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I, the source of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to effect this intrusion upon state sovereignty, simply did not contravene the norms this Court has understood the Eleventh Amendment to exemplify.  Cf. <em>Blatchford </em>v. <em>Native Village of Noatak</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/index.html">501 U. S. 775</a>, 779 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Petitioners, ignoring this history, contend that nothing in the <em>words</em> of the Bankruptcy Clause evinces an intent on the part of the Framers to alter the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground principle\xe2\x80\x9d of state sovereign immunity.  <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</em>, 517 U. S., at 72.  Specifically, they deny that the word \xe2\x80\x9cuniform\xe2\x80\x9d in the Clause implies anything about pre-existing immunities or Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to interfere with those immunities.  See Brief for Petitioners 32\xe2\x80\x9342.  Whatever the merits of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] it misses the point; text aside, the Framers, in adopting the Bankruptcy Clause, plainly intended to give Congress the power to redress the rampant injustice resulting from States\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to respect one another\xe2\x80\x99s discharge orders.  As demonstrated by the First Congress\xe2\x80\x99 immediate consideration and the Sixth Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of a provision granting federal courts the authority to release debtors from state prisons, the power to enact bankruptcy legislation was understood to carry with it the power to subordinate state sovereignty, albeit within a limited sphere.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ineluctable conclusion, then, is that States agreed in the plan of the Convention not to assert any sovereign immunity defense they might have had in proceedings brought pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9cLaws on the subject of Bankruptcies.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Blatchford</em>, 501 U. S., at 779 (observing that a State is not \xe2\x80\x9csubject to suit in federal court unless it has consented to suit, either expressly or in the \xe2\x80\x98plan of the convention\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Maine</em>, 527 U.

Also, in the interim between 1800 and 1867, Congress authorized limited issuance of the writ in response to two crises it viewed as sufficiently pressing to warrant a federal response: The South Carolina nullification controversy of 1828\xe2\x80\x931833 and the imprisonment of a foreign national by New York State a few years later.  See 4 Stat. 632 (1833); 5 Stat. 539 (1842); see also W. Duker, A Constitutional History of Habeas Corpus 187\xe2\x80\x93189 (1980).  The 1833 statute made the writ available to U.

That section provided that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing contained in this law shall, in any manner, affect the right of preference to prior satisfaction of debts due to the United States as secured or provided by any law heretofore passed, nor shall be construed to lessen or impair any right to, or security for, money due to the United States or to any of them.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 Stat. 36.  That Congress felt the need to carve out an exception for States\xe2\x80\x99 preferences undermines any suggestion that it was operating against a background presumption of state sovereign immunity to bankruptcy laws.  Indeed, one contemporary commentator read this section of the Act as requiring that the protected \xe2\x80\x9cpriorit[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d would have to be \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically given by some act of the Legislature of the Union\xe2\x80\x9d before they would be exempt from operation of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  See T.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gibbons</em>, 455 U. S., at 468 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike the Commerce Clause, the Bankruptcy Clause itself contains an affirmative limitation or restriction upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power: bankruptcy laws must be uniform throughout the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  They also cite Justice Frankfurter\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion in <em>Vanston Bondholders Protective Comm. </em>v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/329/156/index.html">329 U.

Based on these authorities, petitioners argue that the word \xe2\x80\x9cuniform\xe2\x80\x9d in the Bankruptcy Clause cannot be interpreted to confer upon Congress any greater authority to impinge upon state sovereign immunity than is conferred, for example, by the Commerce Clause.  See Brief for Petitioners 33.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 logic is not persuasive.  Although our analysis does not rest on the peculiar text of the Bankruptcy Clause as compared to other Clauses of Article I, we observe that, if anything, the mandate to enact \xe2\x80\x9cuniform\xe2\x80\x9d laws supports the historical evidence showing that the States agreed not to assert their sovereign immunity in proceedings brought pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9cLaws on the subject of Bankruptcies.\xe2\x80\x9d  That Congress is constrained to enact laws that are uniform in application, whether geographically or otherwise, cf. <em>Gibbons</em>, 455 U. S., at 470 (invalidating a bankruptcy law aimed at \xe2\x80\x9cone regional bankrupt railroad\xe2\x80\x9d and no one else), does not imply that it <em>lacks power </em>to enact bankruptcy legislation that is uniform in a more robust sense.  See Haines 158\xe2\x80\x93172.  As our holding today demonstrates, Congress has the power to enact bankruptcy laws the purpose and effect of which are to ensure uniformity in treatment of state and private creditors.  See <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Crowninshield</em>, 4 Wheat. 122, 193\xe2\x80\x93194 (1819) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe peculiar terms of the grant certainly deserve notice.

Indeed, our cases are replete with acknowledgments that there is nothing special about the Bankruptcy Clause in this regard.  See<em> Seminole Tribe</em>, 517 U.

The petitioner in <em>Hoffman</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 99\xe2\x80\x94like respondent Katz here\xe2\x80\x94sought to pursue a preference avoidance action against a state agency pursuant to 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7547(b).  The plurality opinion, joined by four Members of this Court, held that Eleventh Amendment immunity barred suit because Congress had failed to enact legislation sufficient to abrogate that immunity, and expressed no view on whether Congress possessed the constitutional power to do so.  <em>Hoffman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 104.  Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment, arguing that there was no need to examine the statute because the Bankruptcy Clause does not empower Congress to enact legislation abrogating state sovereign immunity.  See <em>id.</em>, at 105; see also<em> ibid.</em> (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with Justice Scalia that Congress may not abrogate the States\xe2\x80\x99 Eleventh Amendment immunity by enacting a statute under the Bankruptcy Clause\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, a majority of the Court in <em>Hoffman</em> agreed: (1) that a preference action in bankruptcy against a state agency is barred by sovereign immunity; and (2) that, at a minimum (and absent the State\xe2\x80\x99s consent), overcoming that immunity would require a clearer statutory abrogation than Congress had provided.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, <em>Hoffman</em> can no longer stand.  For today\xe2\x80\x99s decision makes clear that <em>no action</em> of Congress is needed because the Bankruptcy Clause itself manifests the consent of the States to be sued.  <em>Ante, </em>at 21. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority supports its break from precedent by relying on historical evidence that purportedly reveals the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 intent to eliminate state sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4, 15.  The Framers undoubtedly wanted to give Congress the authority to enact a national law of bankruptcy, as the text of the Bankruptcy Clause confirms.  But the majority goes further, contending that the Framers found it intolerable that bankruptcy laws could vary from State to State, and demanded the enactment of a single, uniform national body of bankruptcy law.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9310.  The majority then concludes that, to achieve a uniform national bankruptcy law, the Framers must have intended to waive the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity against suit.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4.  Both claims are unwarranted.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contending that the States waived their immunity from suit by adopting the Bankruptcy Clause, the majority conflates two distinct attributes of sovereignty: the authority of a sovereign to enact legislation regulating its own citizens, and sovereign immunity against suit by private citizens.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Nothing in the history of the Bankruptcy Clause suggests that, by including that clause in Article I, the founding generation intended to waive the latter aspect of sovereignty.  These two attributes of sovereignty often do not run together\xe2\x80\x94and for purposes of enacting a uniform law of bankruptcy, they need not run together.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, Article I also empowers Congress to regulate interstate commerce and to protect copyrights and patents.  These provisions, no less than the Bankruptcy Clause, were motivated by the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 desire for nationally uniform legislation.  See<em> </em>James Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787, reprinted in<em> </em>3 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 539, 547\xe2\x80\x93548 (1911) (hereinafter Farrand\xe2\x80\x99s Debates) (noting lack of national regulation of commerce and uniform bankruptcy law as defects under the Articles of Confederation); M. Farrand, The Framing of the Constitution of the United States 48 (1913) (noting that the Articles of Confederation failed to provide for uniform national regulation of naturalization, bankruptcy, copyrights, and patents).  Thus, we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he need for uniformity in the construction of patent law is undoubtedly important.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida Prepaid</em>, 527 U. S., at 645.<em> </em>Nonetheless, we have refused, in addressing patent law, to give the need for uniformity the weight the majority today assigns it in the context of bankruptcy, instead recognizing that this need \xe2\x80\x9cis a factor which belongs to the Article I patent-power calculus, rather than to any determination of whether a state plea of sovereign immunity deprives a patentee of property without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the abrogation of state sovereign immunity from suit necessary to the enactment of nationally uniform bankruptcy laws.  The sovereign immunity of the States against suit does not undermine the objective of a uniform national law of bankruptcy, any more than does any differential treatment between different categories of creditors.  Cf.<em> Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn. </em>v.<em> Gibbons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/457/index.html">455 U. S. 457</a>, 469 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe uniformity requirement is not a straightjacket that forbids Congress to distinguish among classes of debtors, nor does it prohibit Congress from recognizing that state laws do not treat commercial transactions in a uniform manner\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also greatly exaggerates the depth of the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 fervor to enact a national bankruptcy regime.  The idea of authorizing Congress to enact a nationally uniform bankruptcy law did not arise until late in the Constitutional Convention, which began in earnest on May 25, 1787.  1 Farrand\xe2\x80\x99s Debates xi.  The Convention charged the Committee of Detail with putting forth a comprehensive draft Constitution, which it did on August 6. \xc2\xa0<em>Ibid.</em>; 2 <em>id.</em>, at 177.  Yet the Convention did not consider the language that eventually became the Bankruptcy Clause until September 1, <em>id.,</em> at 483\xe2\x80\x93485, and it adopted the provision with little debate two days later, <em>id.,</em> at 489.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, which emphasizes the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 zeal to enact a national law of bankruptcy, this timing is difficult to explain.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s premise fares even worse in explaining the postratification period.  The majority correctly notes that the practice of the early Congresses can provide valuable insight into the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the Constitution.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  But early practice undermines, rather than supports, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor over a century after the Constitution, . . . the Bankruptcy Clause [authority] remained largely unexercised by Congress. . . . Thus, states were free to act in bankruptcy matters for all but 16 of the first 109 years after the Constitution was ratified.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tabb, The History of the Bankruptcy Laws in the United States, 3 Am. Bankr. Inst. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 5, 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (1995).  And when Congress did act, it did so only in response to a major financial disaster, and it repealed the legislation in each instance shortly thereafter.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14-21.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  It was not until 1898, well over a century after the adoption of the Bankruptcy Clause, that Congress adopted the first permanent national bankruptcy law.  30 Stat. 544.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The historical record thus refutes, rather than supports, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s premise that the Framers placed paramount importance on the enactment of a nationally uniform bankruptcy law.  In reality, for most of the first century of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the country survived without such a law, relying instead on the laws of the several States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the majority identifies <em>no </em>historical evidence suggesting that the Framers or the early legislatures, even if they were anxious to establish a national bankruptcy law, contemplated that the States would subject themselves to private suit as creditors under that law.  In fact, the historical record establishes that the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 held the opposite view.  To the Framers, it was a particularly grave offense to a State\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty to be hauled into court by a private citizen and forced to make payments on debts.  Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 81, followed his general discussion of state sovereign immunity by emphasizing that the Constitution would be especially solicitous of state sovereignty within the specific context of payment of state debts:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]here is no color to pretend that the state governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith.  The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretension to a compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.  To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe?  How could recoveries be enforced?  It is evident that it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication, and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Hans</em>, 134 U. S., at 13 (quoting The Federalist No. 81, at 549).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to bolster its historical argument by making three additional observations about the bankruptcy power: (1) Congress\xe2\x80\x99 early provision of habeas corpus relief in bankruptcy to forbid the imprisonment of a debtor by one State, in violation of a discharge order issued by the courts of another State, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 16\xe2\x80\x9317; (2) the inability of debtors, first in the American Colonies and then under the Articles of Confederation, to enforce in one state court a discharge order issued by another state court, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311; and (3) the historical understanding that bankruptcy jurisdiction is principally <em>in rem</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9315.  The implication is that, if these specific observations about bankruptcy are correct, then States must necessarily be subject to suit in transfer recovery proceedings, if not also in other bankruptcy settings.  <em>Ante,</em> at 12; <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  But none of these observations comes close to demonstrating that, under the Bankruptcy Clause, the States may be sued by private parties for monetary relief.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The availability of habeas relief in bankruptcy between 1800 and 1803 does not support respondent\xe2\x80\x99s effort to obtain monetary relief in bankruptcy against state agencies today.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The habeas writ was well established by the time of the Framing, and consistent with then-prevailing notions of sovereignty.  In <em>Ex parte Young</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/index.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908), this Court held that a petition for the writ is a suit against a state official, not a suit against a State, and thus does not offend the Eleventh Amendment:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe right to so discharge has not been doubted by this court, and it has never been supposed there was any suit against the state by reason of serving the writ upon one of the officers of the state in whose custody the person was found.  In some of the cases the writ has been refused as matter of discretion; but in others it has been granted, while the power has been fully recognized in all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 168 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has reaffirmed <em>Young</em> repeatedly\xe2\x80\x94including in <em>Seminole Tribe</em>, 517 U.

Although the majority observes that <em>Young</em> was not issued \xe2\x80\x9cuntil over a century after the Framing and the enactment of the first bankruptcy statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa014, this observation does nothing to reconcile the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis with <em>Young, </em>as the majority does not purport to question the historical underpinnings of <em>Young</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>holding.  The availability of federal habeas relief to debtors in state prisons thus has no bearing whatsoever on whether the Bankruptcy Clause authorizes suits against the States for money damages.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s second observation\xe2\x80\x94that the Framers were concerned that, under the Articles of Confederation, debtors were unable to obtain discharge orders issued by the court of one State that would be binding in the court of another State, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x94implicates nothing more than the application of full faith and credit, as is apparent from the majority opinion itself.  Accordingly, it has nothing to do with state sovereign immunity from suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support its observation, the majority describes at length two Pennsylvania court rulings issued under the Articles of Confederation.  See<em> James </em>v.<em> Allen</em>, 1 Dall. 188 (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1786); <em>Millar </em>v.<em> Hall</em>, 1 Dall. 229 (Pa. 1788).  But as the majority\xe2\x80\x99s explanation makes clear, the problem demonstrated by these cases is the need for recognition of sister-state judgments by state courts, not disregard for state sovereign immunity against suit in federal courts.  Both <em>James </em>and <em>Millar</em> involved litigation between a private debtor and a private creditor.  In both cases, the creditor filed suit in a Pennsylvania court to enforce a debt.  And in both cases, the debtor sought but failed to obtain recognition of a judgment of discharge that had previously been entered by a court of another State.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, it is unsurprising that, when the issue of bankruptcy arose at the Constitutional Convention, it was also within the context of full faith and credit.  See<em> ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  As the majority correctly points out, the Framers \xe2\x80\x9cplainly intended to give Congress the power to redress the rampant injustice resulting from States\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to respect one another\xe2\x80\x99s discharge orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  But redress of that \xe2\x80\x9crampant injustice\xe2\x80\x9d turned entirely on binding state courts to respect the discharge orders of their sister States under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, not on the authorization of private suits against the States.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority observes that the bankruptcy power is principally exercised through <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9315.  The fact that certain aspects of the bankruptcy power may be characterized as <em>in rem</em>, however, does not determine whether or not the States enjoy sovereign immunity against such <em>in rem </em>suits.  And it certainly does not answer the question presented in this case: whether the Bankruptcy Clause subjects the States to transfer recovery proceedings\xe2\x80\x94proceedings the majority describes as \xe2\x80\x9cancillary to and in furtherance of the court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d though not necessarily themselves <em>in rem</em>,<em> ante</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two years ago, this Court held that a State is bound by a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s discharge order, notwithstanding the State\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of sovereign immunity, because such actions arise out of <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction.  See <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation </em>v.<em> Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/440/index.html">541 U. S. 440</a>, 448 (2004).  In doing so, however, the Court explicitly distinguished recovery of preferential transfers, noting that the debt discharge proceedings there were \xe2\x80\x9cunlike an adversary proceeding by the bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover property in the hands of the State on the grounds that the transfer was a voidable preference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 454.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that transfer recovery proceedings fall outside any possible <em>in rem</em> exception to sovereign immunity is confirmed by <em>United States </em>v.<em> Nordic Village, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/30/index.html">503 U. S. 30</a> (1992), which involved similar facts.  There, the Bankruptcy Trustee filed a transfer avoidance action against the United States, in order to recover a recent payment the debtor had made to the Internal Revenue Service on a tax debt.  See<em> id.</em>, at 31.  After determining that the United States had not waived its sovereign immunity, the Court rejected the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument based on <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[r]espondent sought to recover a sum of money, not \xe2\x80\x98particular dollars,\xe2\x80\x99 so there was no <em>res</em> to which the court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction could have attached.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 38 (quoting <em>Begier </em>v.<em> IRS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/53/index.html">496 U.

See,<em> e.g., </em>9 Annals of Congress 2671 (1799) (noting that Congress had \xe2\x80\x9cnot . . . passed [bankruptcy legislation] for these ten years past, and the States [have] legislated upon it in their own way\xe2\x80\x9d (statement of Rep. Baldwin)); 3 Farrand\xe2\x80\x99s Debates 380 (same)).  It was not until April 4, 1800, that the Sixth Congress finally adopted our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s first bankruptcy law, ch. 19, 2 Stat. 19, and even that law left an ample role for state law, <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>\xc2\xa761, at 36.  (By contrast, the very first Congress enacted, <em>inter alia</em>, patent and copyright legislation.  1 Stat. 109, 124.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, that first Act was short-lived; Congress repealed it just three years later.  2 Stat. 248.  And over a decade later, this Court confirmed what Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inattention had already communicated\xe2\x80\x94that the Bankruptcy Clause does not vest exclusive power in Congress, but instead leaves an ample role for the States.  See<em> Sturges </em>v.<em> Crowninshield</em>, 4 Wheat. 122 (1819).  It was not until 1841 that Congress would enact another bankruptcy law, ch. 9, 5 Stat. 440, only to repeal it less than two years later, ch. 82, 5 <em>id.</em>, at 614.  The economic upheaval of the Civil War caused Congress to pass another bankruptcy law in 1867, ch. 176, 14 Stat. 517, but that too was repealed after just over a decade, ch. 160, 20 Stat. 99.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be sure, the majority opinion adds, in a footnote, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not mean to suggest that every law labeled a \xe2\x80\x98bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x99 law could, consistent with the Bankruptcy Clause, properly impinge upon state sovereign immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa015.  But the majority offers no explanation of this statement; certainly it offers no principled basis on which to draw distinctions in future cases.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This is particularly so given the absence of any known application of that law (let alone any test of its validity) during that time.  The provision was enacted into law on April 4, 1800, ch. 19, 2 Stat. 19, and repealed on December 19, 1803, ch. 6, 2 <em>id.</em>, at 248.  The sole reference cited by the majority is <em>In re Comstock</em>, 6 F. Cas. 237 (No. 3,073) (Vt. 1842), see<em> ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, but that ruling, issued nearly 40 years after the 1800 Act\xe2\x80\x99s repeal, merely noted in dicta<em> </em>the prior existence of the habeas provision.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority also contends that the provision for habeas relief in the 1800 bankruptcy law is \xe2\x80\x9cremarkable not least because it would be another 67 years, after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, before the writ would be made generally available to state prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  The implication is that the Bankruptcy Clause shares a similar pedigree with the Fourteenth Amendment, which (unlike Article I of the Constitution) authorizes Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity against suit.  See,<em> e.g.</em>,<em> Fitzpatrick </em>v.<em> Bitzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/index.html">427 U. S. 445</a> (1976).  But as the majority recognizes, <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa011, Congress <em>did</em> enact other habeas provisions prior to the Fourteenth Amendment.  See<em> </em>4 Stat. 632; 5 Stat. 539; see generally<em> </em>W. Duker, A Constitutional History of Habeas Corpus<em> </em>187\xe2\x80\x93189 (1980) (discussing the 1833 and 1842 Acts).  The Fourteenth Amendment bears no relevance to this discussion in any event, because as I have explained above, habeas relief simply does not offend the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 view of state sovereign immunity.  See also <em>Young</em>, 209 U. S., at 150 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] decision of this case does not require an examination or decision of the question whether [the] adoption [of the Fourteenth Amendment] in any way altered or limited the effect of the [Eleventh] Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The same point was made in <em>Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn. </em>v.<em> Gibbons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/455/457/index.html">455 U.

Given the sovereign status of the States, questions were raised as to whether one State had to recognize the relief given to a debtor by another State [citing <em>James </em>and <em>Millar</em>].  Uniformity among state debtor insolvency laws was an impossibility and the practice of passing private bankruptcy laws was subject to abuse if the legislators were less than honest.  Thus, it is not surprising that the Bankruptcy Clause was introduced during discussion of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 472 (citations omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0Begier</em> involved funds held by the debtor in statutory trust for the United States\xe2\x80\x94so its analysis of those \xe2\x80\x9cparticular dollars\xe2\x80\x9d does not help the respondent in this case.  496 U.

Furthermore, in <em>Whiting Pools </em>the Government possessed merely a secured interest in the property on the basis of a tax lien, see<em> </em>462 U. S., at 202.  By contrast, here, as in <em>Nordic Village</em>, it is uncontested that the State owns the funds, barring any subsequent transfer by operation of bankruptcy law.  See 503 U.
