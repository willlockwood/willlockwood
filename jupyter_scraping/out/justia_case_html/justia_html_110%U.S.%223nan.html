Case also submitted on the briefs.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We have no jurisdiction in this case.  The suit was brought by Dows &amp; Co. to recover damages for the unlawful conversion of 10,000 bushels of corn, the value of which, according to the findings, did not exceed $6,000.  With interest added to this sum from the date of the alleged conversion until the judgment, the most that could have been recovered, upon the special finding, was $6,360.  A judgment was in fact rendered for $2,430.  The matter in dispute in this Court is the difference between these two sums, or only $3,930.  In <em>Hilton v. Dickinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/108/165/case.html">108 U. S. 165</a></span>, it was settled that our jurisdiction depends on the value of the matter in dispute here, and as that in the present case is less than $5,000, it follows that the suit must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
