JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The first question to be decided is whether the circuit court of the United States lawfully acquired and retained jurisdiction of the case.  The determination of this question really </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 153 U. S. 195</a></p><p> depends upon the construction and effect of the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, as corrected by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, but will be aided by referring to the earlier acts of Congress, and to the construction of those acts by this Court.</p>\n<p>The Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 12, authorized "a suit" commenced in any state court "by a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought against a citizen of another state" to be removed by the defendant into the circuit court of the United States upon a petition filed in the state court.  1 Stat. 79.  Under that statute, it was held to be essential to the jurisdiction of the circuit court that all the defendants should be citizens of a different state from any of the plaintiffs.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/7/267/case.html">Strawbridge v.

It not only amends the act of 1875, but it allows to none but defendants the right to remove any case whatever, and, by new regulations of removals for prejudice or local influence, supersedes and repeals the earlier statutes upon this subject.  24 Stat. 553; 25 Stat. 434; <em>Smith v.

It then takes up the subject of the act of 1867, and enacts that in the case, defining it in the words of that act, "where a suit is now pending or may be hereafter brought, in any state court," a removal may be had, not, as under that act, by "such citizen of another state, whether he be plaintiff or defendant," but only by "any defendant being such citizen of another state," and not upon petition to the state court, and the mere affidavit of the petitioner to his belief in prejudice or local influence, but upon petition to the circuit court of the United States, and "when it shall be made to appear to said circuit court" that prejudice or local influence exists.</p>\n<p>Whether this act permits one of two or more defendants to remove any case which he could not have removed under earlier statutes is a question upon which there have been conflicting decisions in the circuit courts, and upon which we are not now required to express a definitive opinion.</p>\n<p>Beyond doubt, the existing act, like every act which preceded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 153 U. S. 198</a></p><p> it, does not authorize one defendant to remove a suit into the circuit court of the United States from a state court, upon the ground of prejudice or local influence between himself and other defendants.  The whole object of allowing a defendant to remove a suit or controversy into the circuit court of the United States is to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining any advantage against him by reason of prejudice or local influence.  Unless such prejudice or influence in favor of the plaintiff is alleged and proved, he cannot be prevented, under the clause of the existing statute upon this subject, from prosecuting his suit against all the defendants in the court in which he originally brought it.</p>\n<p>The present case was a suit for partition, to which all the plaintiffs and all the defendants were indispensable parties.  <em>Torrence v. Shedd,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/527/case.html">144 U. S. 527</a></span>; <em>De la Vega v. League,</em> 64 Tex. 205; <em>Stark v. Carroll,</em> 66 Tex. 393.  Each and all of the defendants contested the rights which the plaintiffs asserted.  The defendants Brady was a citizen of the same state as some of the plaintiffs, and the only prejudice and local influence which he alleged as a ground of removal was between himself and other defendants.  For this reason, independently of other reasons urged against the validity of the removal, Brady\'s removal of the cause into the circuit court of the United States was not warranted by any of the acts of Congress on which he relied.</p>\n<p>Brady, having wrongfully removed the case into the circuit court, must pay the costs in that court, as well as the costs of the three appeals to this Court.  <em>Mansfield &amp;c. Railway Co. v. Swan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/case.html">111 U. S. 379</a></span>; <em>Torrence v. Shedd,</em> and <em>Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters\' Bank,</em> above cited.</p>\n<p><em>Appeal of the plaintiffs sustained, and decree reversed, with costs of the three appeals against Brady, and case remanded to the circuit court, with directions to render judgment against him for costs in that court, and to remand it to the state court.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
