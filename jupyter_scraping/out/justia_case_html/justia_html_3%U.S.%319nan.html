CHIEF JUSTICE ELLSWORTH.</p>\n<p>Suggestions of policy and convenience cannot be considered in the judicial determination of a question of right.  The treaty with France, whatever that is, must have its effect.  By the 19th article it is declared that French vessels, whether public and of war or private and of merchants, may, on any urgent necessity, enter our ports and be supplied with all things needful for repairs.  In the present case, the privateer only underwent a repair, and the mere replacement of her force cannot be a material augmentation, even if an augmentation of force could be deemed (which we do not decide) a sufficient cause for restitution.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p><em>Let the decree of the circuit court be affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
