JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of the argument in behalf of the turnpike company and which lies at the foundation of the defense is that there is no contract in the charter of the turnpike company that prohibited the legislature from authorizing the construction of the rival railroad.  No exclusive privileges had been conferred upon it either in express terms or by necessary implication, and hence whatever may have been the general injurious effects and consequences to the company from the construction and operation of the rival road, they are simply misfortunes which may excite our sympathies but are not the subject of legal redress.</p>\n<p>It might have been very proper for the state, when chartering the railroad, to have provided for compensation for the prospective loss to the turnpike company, as has frequently been done in other states under similar circumstances, but this was a question resting entirely with the legislature of the state, and their action is conclusive on the subject.</p>\n<p>There is another answer to the defense in this case, even assuming that the charter of the turnpike company contained exclusive privileges that forbade the legislature of the state incorporating the railroad company. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="214">Page 70 U. S. 214</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The remedy was not in neglecting to repair the road and at the same time collect the tolls.  It was in restraining, by the proper proceedings, the railroad company from constructing their road.  The breach of the contract on the part of the state furnished no excuse for the turnpike company in disregarding their part of it which was a burden, to-wit, the repairs, while at the same time insisting upon the observance of the part beneficial, to-wit, the collection of the tolls.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* Under the 25th section, of course, of the Judiciary Act of 1789.  <em>See supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/70/51/case.html#57">70 U.
