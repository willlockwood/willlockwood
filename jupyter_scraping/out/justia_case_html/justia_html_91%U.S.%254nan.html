Groves of Madison Parish, Louisiana, by her will, dated the 27th of January, 1872, among other things bequeathed to the Baptist church in the City of Vicksburg, the plantation on which she lived, except one hundred and fifty acres, which were designated, and expressed a desire that the church should hold it, and not sell it, and that the proceeds should be employed to educate young men for the ministry.  She appointed her brother-in-law, Charles Carpenter her universal legatee and executor, giving him seizure of the estate to carry out the provisions of the will and the purposes of the trust.  The will was admitted to probate on the 16th of March, 1872, by the parish judge, and Carpenter assumed the duties of executor and took possession of the estate.</p>\n<p>The bill in this case was filed in September, 1872, by the appellants as Trustees of the Vicksburg Baptist Church of Vicksburg in Mississippi, a body corporate of that state, alleging that said church was the one intended by the will and charging various matters of complaint upon which relief is sought.  The defendants are first the executor, Charles Carpenter; secondly, one Elias S. Dennis, who claims to have been a partner of testatrix; thirdly, Mary Stout, Julia Trezevant, and others, who claim to be the heirs of the testatrix; fourthly, Richard H. Groves and others, who claim to be the heirs of her deceased husband, George W. Groves; fifthly, John A. Klein and others, legatees named in the will.</p>\n<p>The bill states that Carpenter is unfit and incompetent to manage and control the estate, and that he lets it run to waste, and asks that he be removed and a receiver appointed.</p>\n<p>It further states that Dennis has instituted a suit against the executor in the Thirteenth District Court of Louisiana, claiming to have been a partner of testatrix, and that a large amount is due him as such, with a view of absorbing the succession by a judgment, and that the executor is colluding and combining with him, and asks that they be enjoined from continuing such combination.</p>\n<p>It also states that Mary Stout, Julia Trezevant, and others, claiming to be the testatrix\'s heirs, have instituted a suit in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 91 U.

JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A mere statement of the bill is sufficient to show that it cannot be sustained.  Whilst it undoubtedly presents some matters </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 91 U. S. 257</a></p><p> of equitable consideration, they are so mixed up with others of a different character, or which cannot be entertained by the circuit court of the United States and which constitute the main object and purpose of the suit, as to make the bill essentially bad on demurrer.  In the first place, the great object of the suit is to enjoin and stop litigation in the state courts and to bring all the litigated questions before the circuit court.  This is one of the things which the federal courts are expressly prohibited from doing.  By the Act of March 2, 1793, it was declared that a writ of injunction shall not be granted to stay proceedings in a state court.  This prohibition is repeated in sec. 720 of the Revised Statutes, and extends to all cases except where otherwise provided by the Bankrupt Law.  This objection alone is sufficient ground for sustaining the demurrer to the bill.  In the next place, the claim that the court ought to interfere on account of multiplicity of suits is manifestly unfounded.  Only three suits are specified for this purpose in the bill, and each of these has a distinct object, founded on a distinct ground, and is instituted by a distinct class of claimants who had a perfect right to institute the suit they did.  The state courts have full and ample jurisdiction of the cases, and no sufficient reason appears for interfering with their proceedings.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the circuit court is affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
