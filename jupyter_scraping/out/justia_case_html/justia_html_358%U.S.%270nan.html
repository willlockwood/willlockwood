They all concern the power of the courts of Florida to enjoin organizational picketing at twelve Florida resort hotels.  After a series of decisions in regard to these and related cases, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/270/case.html">*</a></span> the Florida Supreme Court, in identical per curiam opinions, affirmed the issuance of permanent injunctions against the picketing. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="271">Page 358 U. S. 271</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Florida courts were without jurisdiction to enjoin this organizational picketing, whether it was activity protected by \xc2\xa7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C \xc2\xa7 157, <em>Hill v. Florida ex rel. Watson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/538/case.html">325 U. S. 538</a></span>, or prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b)(4), <em>Garner v. Teamsters Union,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html">346 U. S. 485</a></span>.  <em>See Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/468/case.html">348 U. S. 468</a></span>, at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/468/case.html#481">348 U. S. 481</a></span>.  This follows even though the National Labor Relations Board refused to take jurisdiction, <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Fairlawn Meats,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/20/case.html">353 U. S. 20</a></span>.  The record does not disclose violence sufficient to give the State jurisdiction under <em>United Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/266/case.html">351 U. S. 266</a></span>.  In none of the twelve cases did the Florida trial courts make any finding of violence, and, in some, an affirmative finding of no violence was made.</p>\n<p>Since it was stipulated below that a witness would testify that interstate commerce was involved in the Florida resort hotel industry, and since the parties asked that "Final Decree be entered by the Chancellor upon the record as now made in the light of this Stipulation," we find it unnecessary to remand for consideration of that question.  <em>See Hotel Employees Local No. 255 v. Leedom,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/99/case.html">358 U. S. 99</a></span>.  Other questions raised by respondents are either without merit or irrelevant to this disposition of the cases.</p>\n<p>Reversed.</p>\n<p>* <em>Sax Enterprises, Inc. v.
