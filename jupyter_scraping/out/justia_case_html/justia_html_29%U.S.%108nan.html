The circumstance of his having been stricken off the roll of counselors of the District Court of the Northern District of New York by the order of the judge of that court for a contempt is one which the Court does not mean to say was not done for sufficient cause, or that it is not one of a serious character, but this Court does not consider itself authorized to punish here for contempts which may have been committed in that court.</p>\n<p>When, on a former occasion, a mandamus was applied for to restore Mr. Tillinghast to the roll of counselors of the district </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 29 U.
