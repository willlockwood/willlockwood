Provided, however, that the capital stock of any bank shall not be returned or taxed for a less amount than its capital stock paid in."</p>\n<p>"It is further agreed that the plaintiff, the said Mechanics\' and Traders\' Bank, has never accepted the said act, nor any part of the said act passed on the twenty-first day of March, 1851, as an amendment to the charter of said bank, nor in any way assented to the same as a valid law so far as the said act related to the said bank, and to the listing of the capital stock and surplus, and contingent fund of said bank, and to the payment of any tax thereon, different from the tax provided for in the said sixtieth section of the said act passed on the 24th day of February, 1845, and it is agreed that the said first section of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 59 U.

If the court shall decide the said question in the negative, then judgment is to be entered against the plaintiff for costs.  It is agreed that all other questions are waived, and that the judgment to be entered herein shall be subject to review and reversal as in other cases.</p>\n<p>Upon this state of facts, the court of common pleas rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant, and gave a certificate that the controversy depended upon the question whether the act passed by the General Assembly of Ohio on the 21st of March, 1851, was contrary to the Constitution of the United States so far as the said act related to the Mechanics\' and Traders\' Bank.  The certificate further stated that the Supreme Court of Ohio decided the said act to be valid, and not contrary to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>A writ of error brought this judgment before this Court for review.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1964037">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Mechanics\' &amp; Traders\' Bank v.
