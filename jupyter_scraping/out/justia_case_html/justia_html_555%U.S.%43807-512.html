LINKLINE COMMUNICATIONS, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93512.\xe2\x80\x83Argued December 8, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 25, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioners (hereinafter AT&amp;T) own infrastructure and facilities needed to provide \xe2\x80\x9cDSL\xe2\x80\x9d service, a method of connecting to the Internet at high speeds over telephone lines.  As a condition for a recent merger, the Federal Communications Commission requires AT&amp;T to provide wholesale DSL transport service to independent firms at a price no greater than the retail price of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s DSL service.  The plaintiffs in this case, respondents here, are independent Internet service providers that compete with AT&amp;T in the retail DSL market in California.  The plaintiffs do not own all the facilities needed to supply DSL service, and must lease wholesale DSL transport service from AT&amp;T.  They filed suit under \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act, asserting that AT&amp;T unlawfully \xe2\x80\x9csqueezed\xe2\x80\x9d their profit margins by setting a high price for the wholesale DSL transport service it sells and a low price for its own retail DSL service.  This maneuver allegedly placed the plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage, allowing AT&amp;T to maintain monopoly power in the DSL market.  AT&amp;T moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were foreclosed by <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/398/index.html">540 U. S. 398</a>, 410, in which this Court held that a firm with no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals has no obligation to provide those rivals with a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d level of service.  The District Court found that AT&amp;T had no antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiffs, but nonetheless denied the motion, holding that <em>Trinko </em>did not address price-squeeze claims.  The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal on the question whether <em>Trinko</em> bars price-squeeze claims when the parties are required to deal by federal communications law, but not antitrust law.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that <em>Trinko </em>did not address the viability of price-squeeze claims, and thus the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint stated a potentially valid \xc2\xa72 claim.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The case is not moot.  The plaintiffs now agree that their claims must meet the Brooke Group</em> test for<em> </em>predatory pricing, apparently apart from their price-squeeze theory.  That test established two requirements for predatory pricing: below-cost retail pricing and a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dangerous probability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant will recoup any lost profits, see <em>Brooke Group Ltd.</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/209/index.html">509 U. S. 209</a>, 222\xe2\x80\x93224.  Despite the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 new position, the parties continue to seek different relief: AT&amp;T seeks reversal of the decision below and dismissal of the complaint, while the plaintiffs seek leave to amend their complaint to allege a <em>Brooke Group </em>claim.  It is also not clear that the plaintiffs have unequivocally abandoned their price-squeeze claims.  Prudential concerns favor answering the question presented; absent a decision on the merits, the Circuit conflict that this Court granted certiorari to resolve would persist.

See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Colgate &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/250/300/index.html">250 U. S. 300</a>, 307.  But in rare circumstances, a dominant firm may incur antitrust liability for purely unilateral conduct, such as charging \xe2\x80\x9cpredatory\xe2\x80\x9d prices.  <em>Brooke Group</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 222\xe2\x80\x93224.  There are also limited circumstances in which a firm\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral refusal to deal with its rivals can give rise to antitrust liability.  See <em>Aspen Skiing Co.</em> v. <em>Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/585/index.html">472 U. S. 585</a>, 608\xe2\x80\x93611.  Here, plaintiffs do not allege predatory pricing, and the District Court concluded that there was no antitrust duty to deal.  Plaintiffs challenge a different type of unilateral conduct in which a firm \xe2\x80\x9csqueezes\xe2\x80\x9d its competitors\xe2\x80\x99 profit margins.  This requires the defendant to operate in both the wholesale (\xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d) and retail (\xe2\x80\x9cdownstream\xe2\x80\x9d) markets.  By raising the wholesale price of inputs while cutting its own retail prices, the defendant can raise competitors\xe2\x80\x99 costs while putting downward pressure on their revenues.  Price-squeeze plaintiffs assert that defendants must leave them a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d margin between wholesale and retail prices.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Where there is no duty to deal at the wholesale level and no predatory pricing at the retail level, a firm is not required to price both of these services in a manner that preserves its rivals\xe2\x80\x99 profit margins.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Any challenge to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s <em>wholesale</em> prices is foreclosed by a straightforward application of <em>Trinko</em>.  The claim in <em>Trinko </em>addressed the quality of Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s support services, while the claims in this case challenge AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s pricing structure.  But for antitrust purposes, there is no meaningful distinction between price and nonprice components of a transaction.  The nub of the complaint in both cases is identical\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants (upstream monopolists) abused their power in the wholesale market to prevent rival firms from competing effectively in the retail market.  But a firm with no antitrust duty to deal in the wholesale market has no obligation to deal under terms and conditions favorable to its competitors.  See <em>Trinko, supra, </em>at 410.  Had AT&amp;T simply stopped providing DSL transport service to the plaintiffs, it would not have run afoul of the Sherman Act.  Thus, it was not required to offer this service at the wholesale prices the plaintiffs would have preferred.

Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/574/index.html">475 U. S. 574</a>, 594.  To avoid chilling aggressive price competition, the Court has carefully limited the circumstances under which plaintiffs can state a Sherman Act claim by alleging that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prices are too low.  See <em>Brooke Group, supra, </em>at 222\xe2\x80\x93224.  The complaint at issue here has no allegation that AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s conduct met either <em>Brooke Group</em> requirement.  Recognizing a price-squeeze claim where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retail price remains above cost would invite the precise harm the Court sought to avoid in <em>Brooke Group</em>: Firms might raise retail prices or refrain from aggressive price competition to avoid potential antitrust liability.  See 509 U. S., at 223.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Institutional concerns also counsel against recognizing such claims.  This Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of clear rules in antitrust law.  Recognizing price-squeeze claims would require courts simultaneously to police both the wholesale and<em> </em>retail prices to ensure that rival firms are not being squeezed.  Courts would be aiming at a moving target, since it is the <em>interaction </em>between these two prices that may result in a squeeze.  Moreover, firms seeking to avoid price-squeeze liability will have no safe harbor for their pricing practices.  The most commonly articulated standard for price squeezes is that the defendant must leave its rivals a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d margin between wholesale and retail prices; this test is nearly impossible for courts to apply without conducting complex proceedings like rate-setting agencies.  Some amici argue that a price squeeze should be presumed if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale price exceeds its retail price.  But if both the wholesale price and the retail price are independently lawful, there is no basis for imposing antitrust liability simply because a vertically integrated firm\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale price is greater than or equal to its retail price.

They assert that such a claim can arise when a vertically integrated firm sells inputs at wholesale and also sells finished goods or services at retail.  If that firm has power in the wholesale market, it can simultaneously raise the wholesale price of inputs and cut the retail price of the finished good.  This will have the effect of \xe2\x80\x9csqueezing\xe2\x80\x9d the profit margins of any competitors in the retail market.  Those firms will have to pay more for the inputs they need; at the same time, they will have to cut their retail prices to match the other firm\xe2\x80\x99s prices.  The question before us is whether such a price-squeeze claim may be brought under \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act when the defendant is under no antitrust obligation to sell the inputs to the plaintiff in the first place.  We hold that no such claim may be brought.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case involves the market for digital subscriber line (DSL) service, which is a method of connecting to the Internet at high speeds over telephone lines.  AT&amp;T[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] owns much of the infrastructure and facilities needed to provide DSL service in California.  In particular, AT&amp;T controls most of what is known as the \xe2\x80\x9clast mile\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lines that connect homes and businesses to the telephone network.  Competing DSL providers must generally obtain access to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s facilities in order to serve their customers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required incumbent phone companies such as AT&amp;T to sell transmission service to independent DSL providers, under the theory that this would spur competition.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to Internet over Wireline Facilities</em>, 20 FCC Rcd. 14853, 14868 (2005).  In 2005, the Commission largely abandoned this forced-sharing requirement in light of the emergence of a competitive market beyond DSL for high-speed Internet service; DSL now faces robust competition from cable companies and wireless and satellite services.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14879\xe2\x80\x9314887.  As a condition for a recent merger, however, AT&amp;T remains bound by the mandatory interconnection requirements, and is obligated to provide wholesale \xe2\x80\x9cDSL transport\xe2\x80\x9d service to independent firms at a price no greater than the retail price of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s DSL service.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re AT&amp;T Inc. and BellSouth Corp.</em>, 22 FCC Rcd. 5662, 5814 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs are four independent Internet service providers (ISPs) that compete with AT&amp;T in the retail DSL market.  Plaintiffs do not own all the facilities needed to supply their customers with this service.  They instead lease DSL transport service from AT&amp;T pursuant to the merger conditions described above.  AT&amp;T thus participates in the DSL market at both the wholesale and retail levels; it provides plaintiffs and other independent ISPs with wholesale DSL transport service, and it also sells DSL service directly to consumers at retail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 2003, the plaintiffs brought suit in District Court, alleging that AT&amp;T violated \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72, by monopolizing the DSL market in California.  The complaint alleges that AT&amp;T refused to deal with the plaintiffs, denied the plaintiffs access to essential facilities, and engaged in a \xe2\x80\x9cprice squeeze.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Specifically, plaintiffs contend that AT&amp;T squeezed their profit margins by setting a high wholesale price for DSL transport and a low retail price for DSL Internet service.  This maneuver allegedly \xe2\x80\x9cexclude[d] and unreasonably impede[d] competition,\xe2\x80\x9d thus allowing AT&amp;T to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve and maintain its monopoly control of DSL access to the Internet.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Verizon Communications Inc.</em> v. <em>Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/398/index.html">540 U. S. 398</a>, 410 (2004), we held that a firm with no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals at all is under no obligation to provide those rivals with a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d level of service.  Shortly after we issued that decision, AT&amp;T moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims in this case were foreclosed by <em>Trinko</em>.  The District Court held that AT&amp;T had no antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiffs, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a\xe2\x80\x9385a, but it denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the price-squeeze claims, <em>id.</em>, at 86a\xe2\x80\x9390a.<em> </em>The court acknowledged that AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\x9chas a certain logic to it,\xe2\x80\x9d but held that <em>Trinko </em>\xe2\x80\x9csimply does not involve price-squeeze claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 86a.  The District Court also noted that price-squeeze claims have been recognized by several Circuits and \xe2\x80\x9care cognizable under existing antitrust standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 89a, and n. 27.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s request, plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint providing greater detail about their price-squeeze claims.  AT&amp;T again moved to dismiss, arguing that price-squeeze claims could only proceed if they met the two established requirements for predatory pricing: below-cost retail pricing and a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dangerous probability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant will recoup any lost profits.

The District Court did not reach the issue whether <em>all</em> price-squeeze claims must meet the <em>Brooke Group</em> requirements, because it concluded that the amended complaint, \xe2\x80\x9cgenerously construed,\xe2\x80\x9d satisfied those criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a\xe2\x80\x9349a, 56a.  The court also certified its earlier order for interlocutory appeal on the question whether \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Trinko</em> bars price squeeze claims where the parties are compelled to deal under the federal communications laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 56a\xe2\x80\x9357a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the price-squeeze claims.  503 F.\xc2\xa03d 876 (2007).  The court emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Trinko </em>did not involve a price squeezing theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 883.  Because \xe2\x80\x9ca price squeeze theory formed part of the fabric of traditional antitrust law prior to <em>Trinko</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthose claims should remain viable notwithstanding either the telecommunications statutes or <em>Trinko</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Based on the record before it, the court held that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 original complaint stated a potentially valid claim under \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Gould dissented, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe notion of a \xe2\x80\x98price squeeze\xe2\x80\x99 is itself in a squeeze between two recent Supreme Court precedents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 886.<em> </em>A price-squeeze claim involves allegations of both a high wholesale price and a low retail price, so Judge Gould analyzed each component separately.  He concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Trinko</em> insulates from antitrust review the setting of the upstream price.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 886\xe2\x80\x93887.  With respect to the downstream price, he argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe retail side of a price squeeze cannot be considered to create an antitrust violation if the retail pricing does not satisfy the requirements of <em>Brooke Group</em>, which set unmistakable limits on what can be considered to be predatory within the meaning of the antitrust laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 887 (citing <em>Brooke Group</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 222\xe2\x80\x93224).  Judge Gould concluded that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint did not satisfy these requirements because it contained no allegations that the retail price was set below cost and that those losses could later be recouped.  503 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 887.  Judge Gould would have allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint if they could, in good faith, raise predatory pricing claims meeting the <em>Brooke Group </em>requirements.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve a conflict over whether a plaintiff can bring price-squeeze claims under \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act when the defendant has no antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiff.  See<em> Covad Communications Co. </em>v. <em>Bell Atlantic Co.</em>, 398 F.\xc2\xa03d 666, 673\xe2\x80\x93674 (CADC 2005) (holding that <em>Trinko </em>bars such claims).  We reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case has assumed an unusual posture.  The plaintiffs now assert that they agree with Judge Gould\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting position that price-squeeze claims must meet the <em>Brooke Group </em>requirements for predatory pricing.  They ask us to vacate the decision below in their favor and remand with instructions that they be given leave to amend their complaint to allege a <em>Brooke Group </em>claim.  In other words, plaintiffs are no longer pleased with their initial theory of the case, and ask for a mulligan to try again under a different theory.  Some amici argue that the case is moot in light of this confession of error.  They contend that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith both petitioners and respondents now aligned on [the same] side of the question presented, <em>no party </em>with a concrete stake in this case\xe2\x80\x99s outcome is advocating for the contrary position.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for COMPTEL 6.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not think this case is moot.  First, the parties continue to seek different relief.  AT&amp;T asks us to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to dismiss the complaint at issue.  The plaintiffs ask that we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions that they be given leave to amend their complaint.  The parties thus continue to be adverse not only in the litigation as a whole, but in the specific proceedings before this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, it is not clear that the plaintiffs have unequivocally abandoned their price-squeeze claims.  In their brief and at oral argument, the plaintiffs continue to refer to their \xe2\x80\x9cpricing squeeze claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondents 13.  They appear to acknowledge that those claims must meet the <em>Brooke Group</em> requirements, but it is not clear whether they believe the necessary showing can be made in at least partial reliance on the sort of price squeeze theory accepted by the Court of Appeals.  At one point, for example, the plaintiffs suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cthe DSL transport price\xe2\x80\x9d may be pertinent to their claims going forward under the theory of Judge Gould\xe2\x80\x99s dissent; that opinion, however, concluded that <em>Trinko </em>\xe2\x80\x9cin essence takes the issu[e] of wholesale pricing out of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 886.

Here, however, the District Court held that AT&amp;T had no such antitrust duty to deal with its competitors, App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a\xe2\x80\x9385a, and this holding was not challenged on appeal.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The challenge here focuses on retail prices\xe2\x80\x94where there is no predatory pricing\xe2\x80\x94and the terms of dealing\xe2\x80\x94where there is no duty to deal.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 price-squeeze claims challenge a different type of unilateral conduct in which a firm \xe2\x80\x9csqueezes\xe2\x80\x9d the profit margins of its competitors.  This requires the defendant to be operating in two markets, a wholesale (\xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d) market and a retail (\xe2\x80\x9cdownstream\xe2\x80\x9d) market.  A firm with market power in the upstream market can squeeze its downstream competitors by raising the wholesale price of inputs while cutting its own retail prices.  This will raise competitors\xe2\x80\x99 costs (because they will have to pay more for their inputs) and lower their revenues (because they will have to match the dominant firm\xe2\x80\x99s low retail price).  Price-squeeze plaintiffs assert that defendants must leave them a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d margin between the wholesale price and the retail price.  In this case, we consider whether a plaintiff can state a price-squeeze claim when the defendant has no obligation under the antitrust laws to deal with the plaintiff at wholesale.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x82A straightforward application of our recent decision in <em>Trinko</em> forecloses any challenge to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s <em>wholesale</em> prices.  In <em>Trinko</em>, Verizon was required by statute to lease its network elements to competing firms at wholesale rates.  540 U. S., at 402\xe2\x80\x93403.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x94a customer of one of Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s rivals\xe2\x80\x94asserted that Verizon denied its competitors access to interconnection support services, making it difficult for those competitors to fill their customers\xe2\x80\x99 orders.  <em>Id.</em>, at 404\xe2\x80\x93405.  The complaint alleged that this conduct in the upstream market violated \xc2\xa72 of the Sherman Act by impeding the ability of independent carriers to compete in the downstream market for local telephone service.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We held that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims were not actionable under \xc2\xa72.  Given that Verizon had no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals at all, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cVerizon\xe2\x80\x99s alleged insufficient assistance in the provision of service to rivals\xe2\x80\x9d did not violate the Sherman Act.  Id.</em>, at 410.  <em>Trinko</em> thus makes clear that if a firm has no antitrust duty to deal with its competitors at wholesale, it certainly has no duty to deal under terms and conditions that the rivals find commercially advantageous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, as in <em>Trinko</em>, the defendant has no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals at wholesale; any such duty arises only from FCC regulations, not from the Sherman Act.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8.  There is no meaningful distinction between the \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient assistance\xe2\x80\x9d claims we rejected in <em>Trinko</em> and the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 price-squeeze claims in the instant case.  The <em>Trinko</em> plaintiffs challenged the quality of Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s interconnection service, while this case involves a challenge to AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s pricing structure.  But for antitrust purposes, there is no reason to distinguish between price and nonprice components of a transaction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</em> v. <em>Central Office Telephone, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/214/index.html">524 U. S. 214</a>, 223 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny claim for excessive rates can be couched as a claim for inadequate services and vice versa\xe2\x80\x9d).  The nub of the complaint in both <em>Trinko </em>and this case is identical\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants (upstream monopolists) abused their power in the wholesale market to prevent rival firms from competing effectively in the retail market.  <em>Trinko </em>holds that such claims are not cognizable under the Sherman Act in the absence of an antitrust duty to deal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court and the Court of Appeals did not regard <em>Trinko </em>as controlling because that case did not directly address price-squeeze claims.  503 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 883; App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a; see also Brief for COMPTEL 27\xe2\x80\x9330.  This is technically true, but the reasoning of <em>Trinko </em>applies with equal force to price-squeeze claims.  AT&amp;T could have squeezed its competitors\xe2\x80\x99 profits just as effectively by providing poor-quality interconnection service to the plaintiffs, as Verizon allegedly did in <em>Trinko</em>.  But a firm with no duty to deal in the wholesale market has no obligation to deal under terms and conditions favorable to its competitors.  If AT&amp;T had simply stopped providing DSL transport service to the plaintiffs, it would not have run afoul of the Sherman Act.  Under these circumstances, AT&amp;T was not required to offer this service at the wholesale prices the plaintiffs would have preferred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xe2\x80\x82The other component of a price-squeeze claim is the assertion that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>retail</em> prices are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo low.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here too plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims find no support in our existing antitrust doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[C]utting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/574/index.html">475 U. S. 574</a>, 594 (1986).  In cases seeking to impose antitrust liability for prices that are too low, mistaken inferences are \xe2\x80\x9cespecially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>Brooke Group</em>, 509 U. S., at 226; <em>Cargill, Inc.</em> v. <em>Monfort of Colo., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/104/index.html">479 U. S. 104</a>, 121\xe2\x80\x93122, n. 17 (1986).  To avoid chilling aggressive price competition, we have carefully limited the circumstances under which plaintiffs can state a Sherman Act claim by alleging that prices are too low.  Specifically, to prevail on a predatory pricing claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival\xe2\x80\x99s costs\xe2\x80\x9d; and (2) there is a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant will be able to recoup its \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment\xe2\x80\x9d in below-cost prices.  <em>Brooke Group</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 222\xe2\x80\x93224.  \xe2\x80\x9cLow prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Richfield Co.</em> v. <em>USA Petroleum Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/328/index.html">495 U. S. 328</a>, 340 (1990).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the complaint at issue in this interlocutory appeal, App. 10\xe2\x80\x9324, there is no allegation that AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s conduct met either of the <em>Brooke Group</em> requirements.  Recognizing a price-squeeze claim where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retail price remains above cost would invite the precise harm we sought to avoid in <em>Brooke Group</em>: Firms might raise their retail prices or refrain from aggressive price competition to avoid potential antitrust liability.  See 509 U. S., at 223 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule, the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant measure of cost either reflects the lower cost structure of the alleged predator, and so represents competition on the merits, or is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control without courting intolerable risks of chilling legitimate price cutting\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xe2\x80\x82Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 price-squeeze claim, looking to the relation between retail and wholesale prices, is thus nothing more than an amalgamation of a meritless claim at the retail level and a meritless claim at the wholesale level.  If there is no duty to deal at the wholesale level and no predatory pricing at the retail level, then a firm is certainly not required to price <em>both</em> of these services in a manner that preserves its rivals\xe2\x80\x99 profit margins.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xe2\x80\x82Institutional concerns also counsel against recognition of such claims.  We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of clear rules in antitrust law.  Courts are ill suited \xe2\x80\x9cto act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trinko</em>, 540 U. S., at 408.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98No court should impose a duty to deal that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise.  The problem should be deemed irremedia[ble] by antitrust law when compulsory access requires the court to assume the day-to-day controls characteristic of a regulatory agency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 415 (quoting Areeda, Essential Facilities: An Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles, 58 Antitrust L.\xc2\xa0J. 841, 853 (1989)); see also <em>Town of Concord </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co.</em>, 915 F.\xc2\xa02d 17, 25 (CA1 1990) (Breyer, C. J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ntitrust courts normally avoid direct price administration, relying on rules and remedies . . . that are easier to administer\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult enough for courts to identify and remedy an alleged anticompetitive practice at one level, such as predatory pricing in retail markets or a violation of the duty-to-deal doctrine at the wholesale level.  See <em>Brooke Group</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 225 (predation claims \xe2\x80\x9crequir[e] an understanding of the extent and duration of the alleged predation, the relative financial strength of the predator and its intended victim, and their respective incentives and will\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Trinko</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 408.  Recognizing price-squeeze claims would require courts simultaneously to police both the wholesale and<em> </em>retail prices to ensure that rival firms are not being squeezed.  And courts would be aiming at a moving target, since it is the <em>interaction </em>between these two prices that may result in a squeeze.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps most troubling, firms that seek to avoid price-squeeze liability will have no safe harbor for their pricing practices.  See <em>Town of Concord</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 22 (antitrust rules \xe2\x80\x9cmust be clear enough for lawyers to explain them to clients\xe2\x80\x9d).  At least in the predatory pricing context, firms know they will not incur liability as long as their retail prices are above cost.  <em>Brooke Group</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 223.  No such guidance is available for price-squeeze claims.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 3B P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law \xc2\xb6767c, p. 138 (3d ed. 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ntitrust faces a severe problem not only in recognizing any \xc2\xa72 [price-squeeze] offense, but also in formulating a suitable remedy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most commonly articulated standard for price squeezes is that the defendant must leave its rivals a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d margin between the wholesale price and the retail price.  See <em>Town of Concord</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9325; <em>Alcoa</em>, 148 F.\xc2\xa02d 416, 437\xe2\x80\x93438 (CA2 1945).  One of our colleagues has highlighted the flaws of this test in Socratic fashion:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[H]ow is a judge or jury to determine a \xe2\x80\x98fair price?\xe2\x80\x99  Is it the price charged by other suppliers of the primary product?  None exist.  Is it the price that competition \xe2\x80\x98would have set\xe2\x80\x99 were the primary level not monopolized?  How can the court determine this price without examining costs and demands, indeed without acting like a rate-setting regulatory agency, the rate-setting proceedings of which often last for several years?  Further, how is the court to decide the proper size of the price \xe2\x80\x98gap?\xe2\x80\x99  Must it be large enough for all independent competing firms to make a \xe2\x80\x98living profit,\xe2\x80\x99 no matter how inefficient they may be? . . . And how should the court respond when costs or demands change over time, as they inevitably will?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Town of Concord</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 25.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some amici respond to these concerns by proposing a \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer price test\xe2\x80\x9d for identifying an unlawful price squeeze: A price squeeze should be presumed if the upstream monopolist could not have made a profit by selling at its retail rates if it purchased inputs at its own wholesale rates.  Brief for American Antitrust Institute (AAI) 30; Brief for COMPTEL 16\xe2\x80\x9319; see <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Indiana &amp; Mich. Elec. Co.</em>, 606 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 757, 776\xe2\x80\x93777 (ND Ill. 1984).  Whether or not that test is administrable, it lacks any grounding in our antitrust jurisprudence.  An upstream monopolist with no duty to deal is free to charge whatever wholesale price it would like; antitrust law does not forbid lawfully obtained monopolies from charging monopoly prices.  <em>Trinko</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 407 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, the Sherman Act does not forbid\xe2\x80\x94indeed, it <em>encourages</em>\xe2\x80\x94aggressive price competition at the retail level, as long as the prices being charged are not predatory.  <em>Brooke Group</em>, 509 U. S., at 223\xe2\x80\x93224.  If both the wholesale price and the retail price are independently lawful, there is no basis for imposing antitrust liability simply because a vertically integrated firm\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale price happens to be greater than or equal to its retail price.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>2.\xe2\x80\x82Amici assert that there are circumstances in which price squeezes may harm competition.  For example, they assert that price squeezes may raise entry barriers that fortify the upstream monopolist\xe2\x80\x99s position; they also contend that price squeezes may impair nonprice competition and innovation in the downstream market by driving independent firms out of business.  See Brief for AAI 11\xe2\x80\x9315; <em>Town of Concord</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem, however, is that amici<em> </em>have not identified any independent<em> </em>competitive harm caused by price squeezes above and beyond the harm that would result from a duty-to-deal violation at the wholesale level or predatory pricing at the retail level.  See 3A P. Areeda &amp; H.

We need not decide whether leave to amend should be granted.  Our grant of certiorari was limited to the question whether price-squeeze claims are cognizable in the absence of an antitrust duty to deal.  The Court of Appeals addressed only AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 <em>original</em> complaint.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  For the reasons stated, we hold that the price-squeeze claims set forth in that complaint are not cognizable under the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs have also filed an amended complaint, and the District Court concluded that this complaint, generously construed, could be read as alleging conduct that met the <em>Brooke Group </em>requirements for predatory pricing.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a\xe2\x80\x9352a, 56a.  That order, however, applied the \xe2\x80\x9cno set of facts\xe2\x80\x9d pleading standard that we have since rejected as too lenient.  See <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html">550 U. S. 544</a>, 561\xe2\x80\x93563 (2007).  It is for the District Court on remand to consider whether the amended complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted in light of the new pleading standard we articulated in <em>Twombly</em>, whether plaintiffs should be given leave to amend their complaint to bring a claim under <em>Brooke Group</em>, and such other matters properly before it.  Even if the amended complaint is further amended to add a <em>Brooke Group </em>claim, it may not survive a motion to dismiss.  For if AT&amp;T can bankrupt the plaintiffs by refusing to deal altogether, the plaintiffs must demonstrate why the law prevents AT&amp;T from putting them out of business by pricing them out of the market.  Nevertheless, such questions are for the District Court to decide in the first instance.  We do not address these issues here, as they are outside the scope of the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals in the decision below.

Such a duty requires a showing of monopoly power, but\xe2\x80\x94as the FCC has recognized, 20 FCC Rcd., at 14879\xe2\x80\x9314887\xe2\x80\x94the market for high-speed Internet service is now quite competitive; DSL providers face stiff competition from cable companies and wireless and satellite providers.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, 503 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 880, amici<em> </em>argue that price-squeeze claims have been recognized by Circuit Courts for many years, beginning with Judge Hand\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aluminum Co. of America</em>, 148 F.\xc2\xa02d 416 (CA2 1945) (<em>Alcoa</em>).  In that case, the Government alleged that Alcoa was using its monopoly power in the upstream aluminum ingot market to squeeze the profits of downstream aluminum sheet fabricators.  The court concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cThat it was unlawful to set the price of \xe2\x80\x98sheet\xe2\x80\x99 so low and hold the price of ingot so high, seems to us unquestionable, provided, as we have held, that on this record the price of ingot must be regarded as higher than a \xe2\x80\x98fair price.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 438.  Given developments in economic theory and antitrust jurisprudence since <em>Alcoa</em>, we find our recent decisions in <em>Trinko</em> and <em>Brooke Group</em> more pertinent to the question before us.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We note a procedural irregularity with this case: Normally, an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint.  See 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \xc2\xa71476, pp. 556\xe2\x80\x93557 (2d ed. 1990).  Here, the District Court addressed the amended complaint in its 2005 order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a\xe2\x80\x9352a, but the court only certified its 2004 order\xe2\x80\x94addressing the <em>original</em> complaint\xe2\x80\x94for interlocutory appeal, <em>id.</em>, at 56a\xe2\x80\x9357a.  Both parties, as well as the Solicitor General, have expressed confusion about whether the amended complaint and the 2005 order are properly before this Court.  See Brief for Petitioners 9, n.\xc2\xa06 (noting \xe2\x80\x9csome ambiguity\xe2\x80\x9d about which order was certified); Brief for United States 17 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is unclear whether the 2005 Order and the amended complaint are properly at issue in this interlocutory appeal\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Respondents 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  The Court of Appeals majority did not address any of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings from the 2005 order, so we decline to consider those issues at this time.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962806">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nPACIFIC BELL TELEPHONE CO.

They may involve a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of dealing\xe2\x80\x9d that, even if profitable, indicates a \xe2\x80\x9cwillingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trinko</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 409.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Aspen Skiing Co.</em> v. <em>Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/585/index.html">472 U. S. 585</a>, 610\xe2\x80\x93611 (1985); Complaint in <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, Civil Action No. 69 Civ. 200 (SDNY, filed Jan. 17, 1969), \xc2\xb620(c), reprinted in F. Fisher, J. McGowan, &amp; J. Greenwood, Folded, Spindled, and Mutilated: Economic Analysis and <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>IBM</em> 357 (1983).  And, as Judge Hand wrote many years ago, a \xe2\x80\x9cprice squeeze\xe2\x80\x9d may fall within that latter category.  <em>Alcoa</em>, <em>supra</em>, at<em> </em>437\xe2\x80\x93438<em>.</em> <em> </em>As a matter of logic, it may be that a particular price squeeze can only be exclusionary if a refusal by the monopolist to sell to the \xe2\x80\x9csqueezed customer\xe2\x80\x9d would also be exclusionary.  But a court, faced with a price squeeze rather than a refusal to deal, is unlikely to find the latter (hypothetical) question any easier to answer than the former.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     I would try neither to answer these hypothetical questions here nor to foreshadow their answer.  We have before us a regulated firm.  During the time covered by the complaint, petitioners were required to provide wholesale digital subscriber line (DSL) transport service as a common carrier, charging \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d rates that were not \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonabl[y] discriminat[ory].\xe2\x80\x9d  47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b), 202(a) (2000 ed.).  And, in my view, a purchaser from a regulated firm (which, if a natural monopolist, is lawfully such) cannot win an antitrust case simply by showing that it is \xe2\x80\x9csqueezed\xe2\x80\x9d between the regulated firm\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale price (to the plaintiff) and its retail price (to customers for whose business both firms compete).  When a regulatory structure exists to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm, the costs of antitrust enforcement are likely to be greater than the benefits.  See <em>Town of Concord</em> v. <em>Boston Edison Co.</em>, 915 F.\xc2\xa02d 17, 26\xe2\x80\x9329 (CA1 1990)<em>.  </em>Cf. 3 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6834\xe2\x80\x93836, pp. 344\xe2\x80\x93355 (1978) (whether a particular course of conduct counts as \xe2\x80\x9cexclusionary\xe2\x80\x9d for antitrust purposes depends upon a host of factors, including, for example, the market position of the defendant, the nature of the market, and the nature of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct).    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike <em>Town of Concord, </em>the regulators here controlled prices only at the wholesale level.  See 915 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 29.  But respondents do not claim that that regulatory fact makes any difference; and rightly so, for as far as I can tell, respondents could have gone to the regulators and asked for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 wholesale prices to be lowered in light of the alleged price squeeze.  Cf. <em>FPC</em> v. <em>Conway Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/271/index.html">426 U. S. 271</a>, 279 (1976); 3 Areeda &amp; Turner, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xb6726e, at 219\xe2\x80\x93220.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents now seek to show only that the defendant engaged in predatory pricing, within the terms of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Brooke Group Ltd.</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/209/index.html">509 U. S. 209</a> (1993).  The District Court can determine whether there is anything in the procedural history of this case that bars respondents from asserting their predatory pricing claim.  And if not, it can decide the merits of that claim.  As I said, I would remand the case so that it can do so. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
