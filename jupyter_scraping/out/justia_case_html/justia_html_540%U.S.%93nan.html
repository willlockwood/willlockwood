S. 567</a>, 572.  In enacting BCRA, Congress sought to address three important developments in the years since this Court\xe2\x80\x99s landmark decision in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> <em>(per curiam):</em>\xc2\xa0the increased importance of \xe2\x80\x9csoft money,\xe2\x80\x9d the proliferation of \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to the first development, prior to BCRA, FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations extended only to so-called \xe2\x80\x9chard money\xe2\x80\x9d contributions made for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office.  Political parties and candidates were able to circumvent FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations by contributing \xe2\x80\x9csoft money\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94money as yet unregulated under FECA\xe2\x80\x94to be used for activities intended to influence state or local elections; for mixed-purpose activities such as get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives and generic party advertising; and for legislative advocacy advertisements, even if they mentioned a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x99s name, so long as the ads did not expressly advocate the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s election or defeat.  With regard to the second development, parties and candidates circumvented FECA by using \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads\xe2\x80\x9d that were specifically intended to affect election results, but did not contain \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words,\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cVote Against Jane Doe,\xe2\x80\x9d which would have subjected the ads to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions.  Those developments were detailed in a 1998 Senate Committee Report summarizing an investigation into the 1996 federal elections, which concluded that the soft-money loophole had led to a meltdown of the campaign finance system; and discussed potential reforms, including a soft-money ban and restrictions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted many of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s proposals in BCRA: Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates; Title II primarily prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for communications that are intended to, or have the effect of, influencing federal election outcomes; and Titles III, IV, and V set out other requirements.  Eleven actions challenging BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality were filed.  A three-judge District Court held some parts of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others.  The parties challenging the law are referred to here as plaintiffs, and those who intervened in support of the law are intervenor-defendants.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  </p>\n<p align="left">251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 948, affirmed in part and reversed in part.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens and Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor delivered the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with respect to BCRA Titles I and II, concluding that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s two principal, complementary features\xe2\x80\x94Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to plug the soft-money loophole and its regulation of electioneering communications\xe2\x80\x94must be upheld in the main.

Such limits are subject only to \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny, see 424  U. S., at 25, rather than to strict scrutiny, because, unlike restrictions on campaign expenditures, contribution limits \xe2\x80\x9centai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in free communication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., id., </em>at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Moreover, contribution limits are grounded in the important governmental interests in preventing \xe2\x80\x9cboth the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g., Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>National Right to Work Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/197/index.html">459 U. S. 197</a>, 208.  The less rigorous review standard shows proper deference to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise, and provides it with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the political process\xe2\x80\x99 integrity.  Finally, because Congress, in its lengthy deliberations leading to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, properly relied on <em>Buckley </em>and its progeny, <em>stare decisis</em> considerations, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits the Court has consistently followed since <em>Buckley.  </em>The Court rejects<em> </em>plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the type of speech and associational burdens that \xc2\xa7323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.

That interest is not limited to the elimination of <em>quid pro quo,</em> cash-for-votes exchanges, see <em>Buckley, supra</em>, at 28, but extends also to \xe2\x80\x9cundue influence on an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and the appearance of such influence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>, 441 <em>(Colorado II)</em>.  These interests are sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves, but also laws preventing the circumvention of such limits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 456.  While the quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments varies with the novelty or plausibility of the justification raised, <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 391, the idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible, see, <em>e.g., Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 38.  There is substantial evidence in these cases to support Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that such contributions of soft money give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.  For instance, the record is replete with examples of national party committees\xe2\x80\x99 peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations.  Pp. 32\xe2\x80\x9345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa7323(a) is not impermissibly overbroad because it subjects <em>all</em> funds raised and spent by national parties to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s hard-money source and amount limits, including, <em>e.g.,</em> funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.  The record demonstrates that the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship, have made all large soft-money contributions to national parties suspect, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s strong interests in preventing corruption, and particularly its appearance, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source, amount, and disclosure limitations.  Pp. 45\xe2\x80\x9347.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Nor is \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on national parties\xe2\x80\x99 soliciting or directing soft-money contributions substantially overbroad.  That prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s reach is limited, in that it bars only soft-money solicitations by national party committees and party officers acting in their official capacities; the committees themselves remain free to solicit hard money on their own behalf or that of state committees and state and local candidates and to contribute hard money to state committees and candidates.  Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that the solicitation ban\xe2\x80\x99s overbreadth is demonstrated by \xc2\xa7323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited amounts of soft money from individual donors under certain circumstances.  The differences between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a) and 323(e) are without constitutional significance, see <em>National Right to Work</em>, 459 U. S., at 210, reflecting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable and expert judgments about national committees\xe2\x80\x99 functions and their interactions with officeholders.

It is reasonable to require that all parties and candidates follow the same rules designed to protect the electoral process\xe2\x80\x99s integrity.  <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7431(20)(A)(i\xe2\x80\x93iv).  All activities that fall within this definition must be funded with hard money.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(1).  The Levin Amendment carves out an exception to this general rule, allowing state and local party committees to pay for certain federal election activities\xe2\x80\x94namely, activities falling within categories (1) and (2) above that either do not refer to \xe2\x80\x9ca clearly identified candidate for Federal office,\xe2\x80\x9d or, if they involve broadcast communications, refer \xe2\x80\x9csolely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii)\xe2\x80\x94with an allocated ratio of hard money and so-called \xe2\x80\x9cLevin funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Levin funds are subject only to state regulation, but for two additional restrictions.  First, no contributor can donate more than $10,000 per year to a single committee\xe2\x80\x99s Levin account.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(iii).  Second, both Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money to pay for such activities must be raised by the state or local committee that spends them, though the committee can team up with other national, state, or local committees to solicit the hard-money portion.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv), 441i(b)(2)(C).

It concluded from the record that soft money\xe2\x80\x99s corrupting influence insinuates itself into the political process not only through national party committees, but also through state committees, which function as an alternate avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.  Indeed, the evidence shows that both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached their direct contribution limit to donate to state committees.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable prediction, based on the history of campaign finance regulation, was that donors would react to \xc2\xa7323(a) by directing soft-money contributions to state committees for the purpose of influencing federal candidates and elections, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties.  Preventing corrupting activity from shifting wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating FECA clearly qualifies as an important governmental interest.

Pp. 57\xe2\x80\x9366.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Section 323(b) is not substantially overbroad.  Although \xc2\xa7323(b) captures some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices, these are the same activities that were covered by the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s pre-BCRA allocation rules, and so had to be funded in part by hard money because they affected <em>both</em> federal and state elections.  As a practical matter, BCRA merely codifies the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s allocation regime principles while justifiably adjusting the applicable formulas in order to restore the efficacy of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding restriction on contributions to state and local committees for the purpose of influencing federal elections.  By limiting its reach to \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that directly benefit federal candidates and thus pose the greatest risk of corruption or its appearance.  The first two categories of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94voter registration efforts and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal election\xe2\x80\x94clearly capture activities that confer a substantial benefit on federal candidates by getting like-minded voters to the polls.  If a voter registration drive does not specifically mention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions.  Moreover, because the record demonstrates abundantly that the third category of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that promote or attack a federal candidate, directly affects the election in which that candidate is participating, application of \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s contribution caps to such communications is closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.  Finally, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in preventing circumvention of \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s other restrictions justifies the requirement of the fourth category of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity\xe2\x80\x9d that federal funds be used to pay any state or local party employee who spends more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities connected with a federal election.

While preserving parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational freedom is important, not every minor restriction on parties\xe2\x80\x99 otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension.  See <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.

The history of campaign finance regulation proves that political parties are extraordinarily flexible in adapting to new restrictions on their fundraising abilities.  Moreover, the mere fact that \xc2\xa7323(b) may reduce the money available to state and local parties to fund federal election activities is largely inconsequential.  The question is not whether the amount available over previous election cycles is reduced, but whether the reduction is so radical as to drive the sound of the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s voice below the level of notice.  <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U.

Absent this provision, national, state, and local party committees would have significant incentives to mobilize their formidable fundraising apparatuses, including the peddling of access to federal officeholders, into the service of like-minded tax-exempt organizations that conduct activities benefiting their candidates.  All of the corruption and the appearance of corruption attendant on the operation of those fundraising apparatuses would follow.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitations ban cannot be squared with \xc2\xa7323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations engaged in federal election activities, is not persuasive.  If \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation restriction is otherwise valid, it is not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have.  See <em>National Right to Work,</em> 459 U. S., at 210.  Furthermore, the difference between the two provisions is explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, remain free to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities.  Given \xc2\xa7323(e)\xe2\x80\x99s tight content, source, and amount restrictions on soft-money solicitations by federal candidates and officeholders, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, \xc2\xa7323(e)\xe2\x80\x99s greater solicitation allowances do not render \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation restriction facially invalid.

Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectly\xe2\x80\x94raising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities.  Although the ban raises overbreadth concerns if read to restrict donations from a party\xe2\x80\x99s federal account\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, funds already raised in compliance with FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source, amount, and disclosure limitations\xe2\x80\x94these concerns do not require that the facial challenge be sustained, given this Court\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to construe a statute, if possible, in such a way as to avoid constitutional questions, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a>, 62.  Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cdonations\xe2\x80\x9d to include donations from a party\xe2\x80\x99s hard-money account, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, the Court narrowly construes \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.

No party seriously questions the constitutionality of the general ban on soft-money donations directly to federal candidates and officeholders and their agents.  By severing the most direct link to the soft-money donor, the ban is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  The solicitation restrictions are valid anticircumvention measures.  Even before BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, federal candidates and officeholders solicited donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their party\xe2\x80\x99s, electoral cause.  See <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 458.  The incentives to do so will only increase with Title I\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money by national, state, and local parties.  Section 323(e) addresses these concerns while accommodating the individual speech and associational rights of federal candidates and officeholders.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7442i(f)\xe2\x80\x94is a valid anticircumvention provision.  The section places no cap on the funds that such candidates can spend on any activity, but, rather, limits only the source and amount of contributions that they can draw on to fund expenditures that directly impact federal elections.  And, by regulating only contributions used to fund \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communications,\xe2\x80\x9d the section focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 principal arguments against the section\xe2\x80\x94(1) that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communications\xe2\x80\x9d as communications that support or attack a clearly identified federal candidate is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) that soft-money contributions to state and local candidates for \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communications\xe2\x80\x9d do not corrupt or appear to corrupt federal candidates\xe2\x80\x94are rejected.  Pp. 77\xe2\x80\x9378.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Several plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that BCRA Title I exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Election Clause authority to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or alter\xe2\x80\x9d rules governing federal elections, U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa74, and violates constitutional federalism principles by impairing the States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate their own elections.  In examining federal Acts for Tenth Amendment infirmity, the Court focuses on whether States and state officials are commandeered to carry out federal regulatory schemes.  See, <em>e.g., Printz </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a>.  By contrast, Title I only regulates private parties\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, imposing no requirements upon States or state officials.  And, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, Title I leaves States free to enforce their own restrictions on state electoral campaign financing.  Moreover, while this Court has policed the absolute boundaries of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Article I power, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a>, plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA.  Indeed, as already found, Title I is closely drawn to match Congress\xe2\x80\x99 important interest in preventing the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  That interest is sufficient to ground Congress\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of its Elections Clause power.  Pp. 79\xe2\x80\x9380.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Also rejected is the argument that BCRA Title I violates equal protection by discriminating against political parties in favor of special interest groups, which remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications).  First, BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways, <em>e.g.,</em> by allowing party committees to receive individual contributions substantially exceeding FECA limits on contributions to nonparty political committees.  More importantly, Congress is fully entitled to consider the salient, real-world differences between parties and interest groups when crafting a campaign finance regulation system, see <em>National Right to Work</em>, 459 U. S., at 210, including the fact that parties have influence and power in the legislature vastly exceeding any interest group\xe2\x80\x99s.  Taken seriously, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection arguments would call into question not just BCRA Title I, but much of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing structure.

The narrowing construction adopted in <em>Buckley</em> limited FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.  BCRA adopts a new term, \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication,\xe2\x80\x9d which encompasses any \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication\xe2\x80\x9d that clearly identifies a candidate for federal office, airs within a specific time period (<em>e.g.,</em> within 60 days of a general election and 30 days of a primary), and is targeted to the relevant electorate.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A)(i).  BCRA also amends \xc2\xa7304 to provide disclosure requirements for persons who fund electioneering communications (and BCRA \xc2\xa7203 amends FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2) to extend those requirements to corporations and labor unions).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs challenge the new term\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality as it applies to both disclosures and expenditures, arguing primarily that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers have an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.  However, a plain reading of <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html">479 U. S. 238</a> <em>(MCFL),</em> shows that the express advocacy restriction is a product of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional command.  Both the concept of express advocacy and the class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional problems of vagueness and overbreadth in the statute before the <em>Buckley</em> Court.  Consistent with the principle that a constitutional rule should never be formulated more broadly than required by the facts to which it is to be applied, <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before the Court and in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.  The notion that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express and issue advocacy also cannot be squared with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.  <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express advocacy line has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found.  Finally, because the components of new FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d are both easily understood and objectively determinable, the vagueness objection that persuaded the <em>Buckley</em> Court to limit FECA\xe2\x80\x99s reach to express advocacy is inapposite here.  Pp. 82\xe2\x80\x9388.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0With regard to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 other concerns about the use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court correctly rejected their submission that new FECA \xc2\xa7304 unnecessarily requires disclosure of the names of persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the individual or group paying for the communication, but erred in finding \xc2\xa7304(f)(5) invalid because it mandates disclosure of executory contracts for communications that have not yet aired.  Because the important state interests identified in <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x94providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding its appearance, and gathering data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions\xe2\x80\x94apply in full to BCRA, <em>Buckley</em> amply supports application of FECA \xc2\xa7304\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements to the entire range of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em> also forecloses a facial attack on the new \xc2\xa7304 provision that requires disclosure of the names of persons who contribute $1,000 or more to segregated funds or spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications.  Under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard of proof, the evidence here did not establish the requisite reasonable probability of harm to any plaintiff group or its members resulting from compelled disclosure.  However,<em> </em>the rejection of this facial challenge does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that disclosure requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court is also unpersuaded by plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to new FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(5)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement regarding the disclosure of executory contracts.  The new provision mandates disclosure only when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.  Given the relatively short time frames in which such communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made in time to provide relevant information to voters is significant.  Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole without the advance disclosure requirement, for political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures about ads slated to run during a campaign\xe2\x80\x99s final weeks simply by making a preelection downpayment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election.  The record contains little evidence of any harm that might flow from the requirement\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement, and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s speculation about such harm cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place.  Pp. 88\xe2\x80\x9395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa06.\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is affirmed insofar as it held that plaintiffs advanced no basis for finding unconstitutional BCRA \xc2\xa7202, which amends FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for electioneering communications that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(7)(C).  That provision clarifies the scope of \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B), which provides that expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or party constitute contributions.  BCRA pre-empts a possible claim that the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B) is limited to spending for express advocacy.  Because <em>Buckley\xe2\x80\x99</em>s narrow interpretation of that term was only a statutory limitation on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate federal elections, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats other coordinated expenditures.  Pp. 96\xe2\x80\x9397.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of new FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2), and reversed to the extent that it invalidated any part of that section.  BCRA \xc2\xa7203 extends to all \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2).  Because those entities may still organize and administer segregated funds, or PACs, for such communications, the provision is a regulation of, not a ban on, expression.  <em>Beaumont, </em>539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the expanded regulation is both overinclusive and underinclusive is informed by the conclusion that the distinction between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled.  Thus, the Court examines the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluates whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden.  Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving that new FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2) is overbroad.  They argue that the justifications that adequately support regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the electioneering communications definition.  That argument fails to the extent that issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for regulating express advocacy apply equally to those ads if they have an electioneering purpose, which the vast majority do.  Also rejected is plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that new FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive because it does not apply to print or Internet advertising.  The record here reflects that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the relevant period.  Congress justifiably concluded that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money.  Finally, \xc2\xa7304(f)(3)(B)(i), which excludes news items and commentary from the electioneering communications definition, is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles as applied to the media.

BCRA \xc2\xa7204, which adds \xc2\xa7316(c)(6), 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441b(c)(2), extends to nonprofit corporations the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications.  This Court upheld a similar restriction in <em>Beaumont</em>, <em>supra, </em>except as it applied to organizations that are formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, have no shareholders, are not established by a business corporation or labor union, and do not accept contributions from those entities, <em>MCFL,</em> 479 U. S., at 264.  The same constitutional objection to applying the pre-BCRA restrictions to such organizations necessarily applies with equal force to FECA \xc2\xa7316(c)(6).  That \xc2\xa7316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt <em>MCFL</em> organizations is not a sufficient reason to invalidate it.  This Court presumes that the legislators were fully aware that the provision could not apply to <em>MCFL</em>-type entities, and the Government concedes that it does not.  As so construed, the provision is plainly valid.  Pp. 103\xe2\x80\x93106.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa09.\xc2\xa0Because this Court has already found BCRA \xc2\xa7201\xe2\x80\x99s executory contract disclosure requirement constitutional, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to a similar disclosure requirement in BCRA \xc2\xa7212, which added FECA \xc2\xa7304(g), 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434, is essentially moot.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(d)(4).  That provision places an unconstitutional burden on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 right to make unlimited independent expenditures.  Although the category of burdened speech is limited to independent expenditures for express advocacy\xe2\x80\x94and therefore is relatively small\xe2\x80\x94it plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection.  The governmental interest in requiring parties to avoid using magic words is not sufficient to support the burden imposed by \xc2\xa7315(d)(4).  The fact that the provision is cast as a choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures does not make it constitutional.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(7)(b)(ii).  FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(i) long has provided that expenditures that are controlled by or coordinated with a candidate will be treated as contributions to the candidate.  BCRA \xc2\xa7214(a) extends that rule to expenditures coordinated with political parties; and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7214 (b) and (c) direct the FEC to promulgate new regulations that do not \xe2\x80\x9crequire agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(a) note.  FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is not overbroad simply because it permits a finding of coordination in the absence of a pre-existing agreement.  Congress has always treated expenditures made after a wink or nod as coordinated.  Nor does the absence of an agreement requirement render \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague.  An agreement has never been required under \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(i), which uses precisely the same language as the new provision to address coordination with candidates, and which has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades.  Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that that the definition has chilled political speech, and have made no attempt to explain how an agreement requirement would prevent the FEC from engaging in what they fear will be intrusive and politically motivated investigations.  Finally, in this facial challenge to BCRA, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that they allege constitutional infirmities in the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s new regulations rather than the statute.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7315(b).  Section 305\xe2\x80\x99s amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that charge in specified circumstances.  47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(b)(2)(A), (C).  Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that he plans to run ads critical of his opponents and had run them in the past is too remote temporally to satisfy the Article III standing requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate an \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d that is \xe2\x80\x9cactual or imminent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Whitmore</em> v. <em>Arkansas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/149/index.html">495 U. S. 149</a>, 155, 158, given that the lowest unit charge requirement is not available until 45 days before a primary, that Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s current term does not expire until 2009, and that, therefore, the earliest day he could be affected by \xc2\xa7305 is 45 days before the 2008 Republican primary election.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Adams and Paul plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA \xc2\xa7307, which amends FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(1) to increase and index for inflation certain contribution limits.  Neither injury alleged by the Adams plaintiffs, a group of voters, voter organizations, and candidates, is sufficient to confer standing.  First, their assertion that \xc2\xa7307 deprives them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status does not satisfy the standing requirement that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s alleged injury be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest, <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560, since political \xe2\x80\x9cfree trade\xe2\x80\x9d does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources, <em>e.g., MCFL, </em>479 U. S., at 257<em>.</em>  Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates\xe2\x80\x99 contention that \xc2\xa7307 puts them at a \xe2\x80\x9cfundraising disadvantage\xe2\x80\x9d compared to their opponents because they do not wish to solicit or accept the large campaign contributions BCRA permits does not meet the standing requirement that their alleged injury be \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7307, see <em>Lujan, supra,</em> at 562, since their alleged inability to compete stems not from \xc2\xa7307\xe2\x80\x99s operation, but from their own personal choice not to solicit or accept large contributions.  Also inadequate for standing purposes is the Paul plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 contention that their congressional campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities, such that \xc2\xa7307\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits, together with FECA \xc2\xa7315\xe2\x80\x99s individual and PAC contribution limitations, impose unconstitutional editorial control on them in violation of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom of the Press Clause.  These plaintiffs cannot show the requisite substantial likelihood their requested relief will remedy their alleged injury in fact, see <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/765/index.html">529 U. S. 765</a>, 771, since, even if the Court were to strike down BCRA \xc2\xa7307\xe2\x80\x99s increases and indexes, as they ask, both FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits and an exemption for institutional news media would remain unchanged.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Adams plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaire provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7304, 315, and 316, which provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s opponent spends a triggering amount of his personal funds, and eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances.  Because these plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA \xc2\xa7307, they fail to state a cognizable injury that is fairly traceable to BCRA.  Additionally, none of them is a candidate in an election affected by the millionaire provisions, and it would be purely conjectural to assume that any of them ever will be.  P.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding BCRA \xc2\xa7311\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of FECA \xc2\xa7318(a) to include mandatory electioneering-communications-disbursements disclosure is affirmed because such inclusion bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of \xe2\x80\x9cshed[ding] the light of publicity\xe2\x80\x9d on campaign financing, <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 81<em>.  </em>Assuming, as the Court must, that FECA \xc2\xa7318 is valid both to begin with and as amended by BCRA \xc2\xa7311\xe2\x80\x99s amendments other than the electioneering-communications inclusion, the latter inclusion is not itself unconstitutional.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441k\xe2\x80\x94violates the First Amendment rights of minors, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Tinker</em> v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/index.html">393 U. S. 503</a>, 511\xe2\x80\x93513.  Because limitations on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s political contributions impinge on the freedoms of expression and association, see <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9322, the Court applies heightened scrutiny to such a limitation, asking whether it is justified by a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid unnecessary abridgment of the First Amendment, see <em>e.g.,</em> <em>post,</em> at 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (joint opinion of Stevens<em> </em>and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, JJ.).  The Government offers scant evidence for its assertion that \xc2\xa7318 protects against corruption by conduit\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> donations by parents through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents.  Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for \xc2\xa7318 to withstand heightened scrutiny.  See <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 391.  Even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive, as shown by the States\xe2\x80\x99 adoption of more tailored approaches.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0Because the FEC clearly has standing, the Court need not address whether the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s, were properly granted intervention pursuant to, <em>inter alia</em>, BCRA \xc2\xa7403(b).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>City of New York, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/417/index.html">524 U. S. 417</a>, 431\xe2\x80\x93432, n.\xc2\xa019.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7315(e)\xe2\x80\x94concluding that the portion of the judgment below invalidating \xc2\xa7504 as facially violative of the First Amendment must be reversed.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94are upheld.  They are virtually identical to those contained in a longstanding FCC regulation.  The McConnell plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the requirements are intolerably burdensome and invasive is rejected.  The FCC has consistently estimated that its regulation imposes upon a licensee a comparatively small additional administrative burden.  Moreover, the \xc2\xa7504 requirement is supported by significant governmental interests in verifying that licensees comply with their obligations to allow political candidates \xe2\x80\x9cequal time,\xe2\x80\x9d 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7315(a), and to sell such time at the \xe2\x80\x9clowest unit charge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7315(b); in evaluating whether they are processing candidate requests in an evenhanded fashion to help assure broadcasting fairness, \xc2\xa7315(a); in making the public aware of how much candidates spend on broadcast messages; 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434; and in providing an independently compiled set of data for verifying candidates\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s and FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements and source limitations, <em>ibid.</em>  Because the Court cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, it cannot strike down BCRA \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate request\xe2\x80\x9d provision, which simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate request\xe2\x80\x9d requirements are constitutional, its \xe2\x80\x9celection message\xe2\x80\x9d requirements\xe2\x80\x94which serve similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden in requiring broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast \xe2\x80\x9cmessage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that refer either to a \xe2\x80\x9clegally qualified candidate\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cany election to Federal office,\xe2\x80\x9d 47 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical matter of national importance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x94survive the McConnell plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge.  These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help determine whether broadcasters are fulfilling their obligations under the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on important public issues or whether they too heavily favor entertainment, discriminating against public affairs broadcasts.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the above-quoted statutory language is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad is unpersuasive, given that it is no more general than language Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters and is roughly comparable to other BCRA language upheld in this litigation.  Whether the \xe2\x80\x9cissue request\xe2\x80\x9d requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies them.  The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Without the greater information any such challenge will likely provide, the Court cannot say that the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 administrative burdens are so great, or their justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding them facially unconstitutional.  Similarly, the argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cissue request\xe2\x80\x9d requirement will force the purchasers to disclose information revealing their political strategies to opponents does not show that BCRA \xc2\xa7504 is facially unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when \xc2\xa7504 is applied.

We have noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contention that particular conduct is illegal, \xe2\x80\xa6 it often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Warth</em> v. <em>Seldin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/490/index.html">422 U.

Their reliance on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s voting rights cases is misplaced.  They rely on cases requiring nondiscriminatory access to the ballot and a single, equal vote for each voter.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lubin</em> v. <em>Panish,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/709/index.html">415 U.

Instead, the plaintiffs allege a curtailment of the scope of their participation in the electoral process.  But we have noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]olitical \xe2\x80\x98free trade\xe2\x80\x99 does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html">479 U.

This claim of injury by the Adams plaintiffs is, therefore, not to a legally cognizable right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates contend that they have suffered a competitive injury.  Their candidates \xe2\x80\x9cdo not wish to solicit or accept large campaign contributions as permitted by BCRA\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hey believe such contributions create the appearance of unequal access and influence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adams Complaint \xc2\xb6  ;53.  As a result, they claim that BCRA \xc2\xa7307 puts them at a \xe2\x80\x9cfundraising disadvantage,\xe2\x80\x9d making it more difficult for them to compete in elections.  See <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6  ;56.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second claimed injury is based on the same premise as the first: BCRA \xc2\xa7307\xe2\x80\x99s increased hard money limits allow plaintiffs-candidates\xe2\x80\x99 opponents to raise more money, and, consequently, the plaintiffs-candidates\xe2\x80\x99 ability to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished.  But they cannot show that their alleged injury is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable\xe2\x80\x9d to BCRA \xc2\xa7307.  See <em>Lujan, supra,</em> at 562.  Their alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of \xc2\xa7307, but from their own personal \xe2\x80\x9cwish\xe2\x80\x9d not to solicit or accept large contributions, <em>i.e</em>.,<em> </em>their personal choice.  Accordingly, the Adams plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable\xe2\x80\x9d to BCRA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Paul plaintiffs maintain that BCRA \xc2\xa7307 violates the Freedom of Press Clause of the First Amendment.  They contend that their political campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities and that, therefore, they are protected by the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of the freedom of press.  The Paul plaintiffs argue that the contribution limits imposed by BCRA \xc2\xa7307, together with the individual and political action committee contribution limitations of FECA \xc2\xa7315, impose unconstitutional editorial control upon candidates and their campaigns.  The Paul plaintiffs argue that by imposing economic burdens upon them, but not upon the institutional media, see 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431(9)(B)(i) (exempting \xe2\x80\x9cany news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate\xe2\x80\x9d from the definition of expenditure), BCRA \xc2\xa7307 and FECA \xc2\xa7315 violate the freedom of the press.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Paul plaintiffs cannot show the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial likelihood\xe2\x80\x99 that the requested relief will remedy [their] alleged injury in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Stevens</em>, 529 U. S., at 771.  The relief the Paul plaintiffs seek is for this Court to strike down the contribution limits, removing the alleged disparate editorial controls and economic burdens imposed on them.  But \xc2\xa7307 merely increased and indexed for inflation certain FECA contribution limits.  This Court has no power to adjudicate a challenge to the FECA limits in this case because challenges to the constitutionality of FECA provisions are subject to direct review before an appropriate en banc court of appeals, as provided in 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437h, not in the three-judge District Court convened pursuant to BCRA \xc2\xa7403(a).  Although the Court has jurisdiction to hear a challenge to \xc2\xa7307, if the Court were to strike down the increases and indexes established by BCRA \xc2\xa7307, it would not remedy the Paul plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injury because both the limitations imposed by FECA and the exemption for news media would remain unchanged.  A ruling in the Paul plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 favor, therefore, would not redress their alleged injury, and they accordingly lack standing.

As first enacted, that statute required disclosure of all contributions exceeding $100 and of expenditures by candidates and political committees that spent more than $1,000 per year.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9319.  It also prohibited contributions made in the name of another person, <em>id.,</em> at 19, and by Government contractors, <em>id.,</em> at 10.  The law ratified the earlier prohibition on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds for political contributions and expenditures, but it expressly permitted corporations and unions to establish and administer separate segregated funds (commonly known as political action committees, or PACs) for election-related contributions and expenditures.  <em>Id</em>., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See <em>Pipefitters </em>v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/385/index.html">407 U.

Evidence of those practices persuaded Congress to enact the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 1263.  Reviewing a constitutional challenge to the amendments, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit described them as \xe2\x80\x9cby far the most comprehensive \xe2\x80\xa6 reform legislation [ever] passed by Congress concerning the election of the President, Vice-President and members of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 821, 831 (1975) (en banc) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1974 amendments closed the loophole that had allowed candidates to use an unlimited number of political committees for fundraising purposes and thereby to circumvent the limits on individual committees\xe2\x80\x99 receipts and disbursements.  They also limited individual political contributions to any single candidate to $1,000 per election, with an overall annual limitation of $25,000 by any contributor; imposed ceilings on spending by candidates and political parties for national conventions; required reporting and public disclosure of contributions and expenditures exceeding certain limits; and established the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to administer and enforce the legislation.  <em>Id</em>., at 831\xe2\x80\x93834<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals upheld the 1974 amendments almost in their entirety.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It concluded that the clear and compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process provided a sufficient basis for sustaining the substantive provisions of the Act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 841.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion relied heavily on findings that large contributions facilitated access to public officials[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and described methods of evading the contribution limits that had enabled contributors of massive sums to avoid disclosure.  <em>Id.</em>, at 837\xe2\x80\x93841.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals upheld the provisions establishing contribution and expenditure limitations on the theory that they should be viewed as regulations of conduct rather than speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 840\xe2\x80\x93841 (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U.

This Court, however, concluded that each set of limitations raised serious\xe2\x80\x94though different\xe2\x80\x94concerns under the First Amendment.  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 14\xe2\x80\x9323 (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We treated the limitations on candidate and individual expenditures as direct restraints on speech, but we observed that the contribution limitations, in contrast, imposed only \xe2\x80\x9ca marginal restriction upon the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in free communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Considering the \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply disturbing examples\xe2\x80\x9d of corruption related to candidate contributions discussed in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion, we determined that limiting contributions served an interest in protecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of our system of representative democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  In the end, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94provided \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We prefaced our analysis of the $1,000 limitation on expenditures by observing that it broadly encompassed every expenditure \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relative to a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 39 (quoting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV)).  To avoid vagueness concerns we construed that phrase to apply only to \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 42\xe2\x80\x93\n44.  We concluded, however, that as so narrowed, the provision would not provide effective protection against the dangers of <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements, because persons and groups could eschew expenditures that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate while remaining \xe2\x80\x9cfree to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 45.  We also rejected the argument that the expenditure limits were necessary to prevent attempts to circumvent the Act\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits, because FECA already treated expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate as contributions, and we were not persuaded that independent expenditures posed the same risk of real or apparent corruption as coordinated expenditures.  <em>Id.</em>, at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  We therefore held that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in preventing real or apparent corruption was inadequate to justify the heavy burdens on the freedoms of expression and association that the expenditure limits imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We upheld all of the disclosure and reporting requirements in the Act that were challenged on appeal to this Court after finding that they vindicated three important interests: providing the electorate with relevant information about the candidates and their supporters; deterring actual corruption and discouraging the use of money for improper purposes; and facilitating enforcement of the prohibitions in the Act.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 66\xe2\x80\x9368.  In order to avoid an overbreadth problem, however, we placed the same narrowing construction on the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure\xe2\x80\x9d in the disclosure context that we had adopted in the context of the expenditure limitations.  Thus, we construed the reporting requirement for persons making expenditures of more than $100 in a year \xe2\x80\x9cto reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at<em> </em>80 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our opinion in <em>Buckley</em> addressed issues that primarily<em> </em>related to contributions and expenditures by individuals, since none of the parties challenged the prohibition on contributions by corporations and labor unions.  We noted, however, that the statute authorized the use of corporate and union resources to form and administer segregated funds that could be used for political purposes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329, n.\xc2\xa031; see also n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three important developments in the years after our decision in <em>Buckley </em>persuaded Congress that further legislation was necessary to regulate the role that corporations, unions, and wealthy contributors play in the electoral process.  As a preface to our discussion of the specific provisions of BCRA, we comment briefly on the increased importance of \xe2\x80\x9csoft money,\xe2\x80\x9d the proliferation of \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads,\xe2\x80\x9d and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Soft Money</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under FECA, \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions\xe2\x80\x9d must be made with funds that are subject to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations.

Donations made solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections are therefore unaffected by FECA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements and prohibitions.  As a result, prior to the enactment of BCRA, federal law permitted corporations and unions, as well as individuals who had already made the maximum permissible contributions to federal candidates, to contribute \xe2\x80\x9cnonfederal money\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94also known as \xe2\x80\x9csoft money\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to political parties for activities intended to influence state or local elections.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after <em>Buckley </em>was decided, questions arose concerning the treatment of contributions intended to influence both federal and state elections.  Although a literal reading of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d would have required such activities to be funded with hard money, the<em> </em>FEC ruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activities\xe2\x80\x94including get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising\xe2\x80\x94in part with soft money.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In 1995 the FEC concluded that the parties could also use soft money to defray the costs of \xe2\x80\x9clegislative advocacy media advertisements,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the ads mentioned the name of a federal candidate, so long as they did not expressly advocate the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s election or defeat.  FEC Advisory Op. 1995\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the permissible uses of soft money expanded, the amount of soft money raised and spent by the national political parties increased exponentially.  Of the two major parties\xe2\x80\x99 total spending, soft money accounted for 5% ($21.6 million) in 1984, 11% ($45 million) in 1988, 16% ($80 million) in 1992, 30% ($272 million) in 1996, and 42% ($498 million) in 2000.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The national parties transferred large amounts of their soft money to the state parties, which were allowed to use a larger percentage of soft money to finance mixed-purpose activities under FEC rules.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In the year 2000, for example, the national parties diverted $280 million\xe2\x80\x94more than half of their soft money\xe2\x80\x94to state parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many contributions of soft money were dramatically larger than the contributions of hard money permitted by FECA.  For example, in 1996 the top five corporate soft-money donors gave, in total, more than $9 million in nonfederal funds to the two national party committees.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In the most recent election cycle the political parties raised almost $300 million\xe2\x80\x9460% of their total soft-money fundraising\xe2\x80\x94from just 800 donors, each of which contributed a minimum of $120,000.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Moreover, the largest corporate donors often made substantial contributions to both parties.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Such practices corroborate evidence indicating that many corporate contributions were motivated by a desire for access to candidates and a fear of being placed at a disadvantage in the legislative process relative to other contributors, rather than by ideological support for the candidates and parties.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only were such soft-money contributions often designed to gain access to federal candidates, but they were in many cases solicited by the candidates themselves.  Candidates often directed potential donors to party committees and tax-exempt organizations that could legally accept soft money.  For example, a federal legislator running for reelection solicited soft money from a supporter by advising him that even though he had already \xe2\x80\x9ccontributed the legal maximum\xe2\x80\x9d to the campaign committee, he could still make an additional contribution to a joint program supporting federal, state, and local candidates of his party.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Such solicitations were not uncommon.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The solicitation, transfer, and use of soft money thus enabled parties and candidates to circumvent FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on the source and amount of contributions in connection with federal elections.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Issue Advertising</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Buckley</em> we construed FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as its expenditure limitations, \xe2\x80\x9cto reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 80 (footnote omitted).  As a result of that strict reading of the statute, the use or omission of \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9cElect John Smith\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cVote Against Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x9d marked a bright statutory line separating \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cissue advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 44, n. 52.  Express advocacy was subject to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations and could be financed only using hard money.  The political parties, in other words, could not use soft money to sponsor ads that used any magic words, and corporations and unions could not fund such ads out of their general treasuries.  So-called issue ads, on the other hand, not only could be financed with soft money, but could be aired without disclosing the identity of, or any other information about, their sponsors.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d and express advocacy seemed neat in theory, the two categories of advertisements proved functionally identical in important respects.  Both were used to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates, even though the so-called issue ads eschewed the use of magic words.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Little difference existed, for example, between an ad that urged viewers to \xe2\x80\x9cvote against Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x9d and one that condemned Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to \xe2\x80\x9ccall Jane Doe and tell her what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Indeed, campaign professionals testified that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products such as Coca-Cola, should, and did, avoid the use of the magic words.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Moreover, the conclusion that such ads were specifically intended to affect election results was confirmed by the fact that almost all of them aired in the 60 days immediately preceding a federal election.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Corporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] and those expenditures, like soft-money donations to the political parties, were unregulated under FECA.  Indeed, the ads were attractive to organizations and candidates precisely because they were beyond FECA\xe2\x80\x99s reach, enabling candidates and their parties to work closely with friendly interest groups to sponsor so-called issue ads when the candidates themselves were running out of money.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements did not apply to so-called issue ads, sponsors of such ads often used misleading names to conceal their identity.  \xe2\x80\x9cCitizens for Better Medicare,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, was not a grassroots organization of citizens, as its name might suggest, but was instead a platform for an association of drug manufacturers.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  And \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans for Clean Air,\xe2\x80\x9d which ran ads in the 2000 Republican Presidential primary, was actually an organization consisting of just two individuals\xe2\x80\x94brothers who together spent $25 million on ads supporting their favored candidate.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads, the record indicates that candidates and officeholders often were.  A former Senator confirmed that candidates and officials knew who their friends were and \xe2\x80\x9csometimes suggest[ed] that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups that run \xe2\x80\x98issue ads.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  As with soft-money contributions, political parties and candidates used the availability of so-called issue ads to circumvent FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations, asking donors who contributed their permitted quota of hard money to give money to nonprofit corporations to spend on \xe2\x80\x9cissue\xe2\x80\x9d advocacy.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Senate Committee Investigation</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998 the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a six-volume report summarizing the results of an extensive investigation into the campaign practices in the 1996 federal elections.

The two reports reached consensus, however, on certain central propositions.  They agreed that the \xe2\x80\x9csoft money loophole\xe2\x80\x9d had led to a \xe2\x80\x9cmeltdown\xe2\x80\x9d of the campaign finance system that had been intended \xe2\x80\x9cto keep corporate, union and large individual contributions from influencing the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  One Senator stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe hearings provided overwhelming evi-\ndence that the twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue advertising have virtually destroyed our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The report was critical of both parties\xe2\x80\x99 methods of raising soft money, as well as their use of those funds.  It concluded that both parties promised and provided special access to candidates and senior Government officials in exchange for large soft-money contributions.  The Committee majority described the White House coffees that rewarded major donors with access to President Clinton,[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and the courtesies extended to an international businessman named Roger Tamraz, who candidly acknowledged that his donations of about $300,000 to the DNC and to state parties were motivated by his interest in gaining the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s support for an oil-line project in the Caucasus.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The minority described the promotional materials used by the RNC\xe2\x80\x99s two principal donor programs, \xe2\x80\x9cTeam 100\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican Eagles,\xe2\x80\x9d which promised \xe2\x80\x9cspecial access to high-ranking Republican elected officials, including governors, senators, and representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  </em>One fundraising letter recited that the chairman of the RNC had personally escorted a donor on appointments that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98turned out to be very significant in legislation affecting public utility holding companies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and made the donor \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a hero in his industry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996 both parties began to use large amounts of soft money to pay for issue advertising designed to influence federal elections.  The Committee found such ads highly problematic for two reasons.  Since they accomplished the same purposes as express advocacy (which could lawfully be funded only with hard money), the ads enabled unions, corporations, and wealthy contributors to circumvent protections that FECA was intended to provide.  Moreover, though ostensibly independent of the candidates, the ads were often actually coordinated with, and controlled by, the campaigns.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  The ads thus provided a means for evading FECA\xe2\x80\x99s candidate contribution limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The report also emphasized the role of state and local parties.  While the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s allocation regime permitted national parties to use soft money to pay for up to 40% of the costs of both generic voter activities and issue advertising, they allowed state and local parties to use larger percentages of soft money for those purposes.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  For that reason, national parties often made substantial transfers of soft money to \xe2\x80\x9cstate and local political parties for \xe2\x80\x98generic voter activities\xe2\x80\x99 that in fact ultimately benefit[ed] federal candidates because the funds for all practical purposes remain[ed] under the control of the national committees.\xe2\x80\x9d  The report concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he use of such soft money thus allow[ed] more corporate, union treasury, and large contributions from wealthy individuals into the system.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The report discussed potential reforms, including a ban on soft money at the national and state party levels and restrictions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  The majority expressed the view that a ban on the raising of soft money by national party committees would effectively address the use of union and corporate general treasury funds in the federal political process only if it required that candidate-specific ads be funded with hard money.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  The minority similarly recommended the elimination of soft-money contributions to political parties from individuals, corporations, and unions, as well as \xe2\x80\x9creforms addressing candidate advertisements masquerading as issue ads.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In BCRA, Congress enacted many of the committee\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reforms.  BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s central provisions are designed to address Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about the increasing use of soft money and issue advertising to influence federal elections.  Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates.

Mindful of \xc2\xa7403\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that we expedite our disposition of these appeals to the greatest extent possible, we also consider each of the issues in order.

These \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activit[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d defined in new FECA \xc2\xa7301(20)(A), are almost identical to the mixed-purpose activities that have long been regulated under the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s pre-BCRA allocation regime.  2 U.

New FECA \xc2\xa7323(e) restricts federal candidates and officeholders from receiving, spending, or soliciting soft money in connection with federal elections and limits their ability to do so in connection with state and local elections.  2 U.

In these cases we have recognized that contribution limits, unlike limits on expenditures, \xe2\x80\x9centai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in free communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 20; see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Beaumont</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 14); <em>Shrink Missouri</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 386\xe2\x80\x93388.  In <em>Buckley </em>we said that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.  The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of the contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing.  At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s support for the candidate.  A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to discuss candidates and issues.  While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\xe2\x80\x9d  424  U. S., at 21 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBecause the communicative value of large contributions inheres mainly in their ability to facilitate the speech of their recipients, we have said that contribution limits impose serious burdens on free speech only if they are so low as to \xe2\x80\x9cpreven[t] candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have recognized that contribution limits may bear \xe2\x80\x9cmore heavily on the associational right than on freedom to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 388, since contributions serve \xe2\x80\x9cto affiliate a person with a candidate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cenabl[e] like-minded persons to pool their resources,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

Because the electoral process is the very \xe2\x80\x9cmeans through which a free society democratically translates political speech into concrete governmental action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 401 (Breyer, J., concurring), contribution limits, like other measures aimed at protecting the integrity of the process, tangibly benefit public participation in political debate.  For that reason, when reviewing Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to enact contribution limits, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no place for a strong presumption against constitutionality, of the sort often thought to accompany the words \xe2\x80\x98strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 400 (Breyer, J., concurring).  The less rigorous standard of review we have applied to contribution limits (<em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny) shows proper deference to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise.  It also provides Congress with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the integrity of the political process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our application of this less rigorous degree of scrutiny has given rise to significant criticism in the past from our dissenting colleagues.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U.

We are also mindful of the fact that in its lengthy deliberations leading to the enactment of BCRA, Congress properly relied on the recognition of its authority contained in <em>Buckley </em>and its progeny.  Considerations of <em>stare decisis</em>, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe to one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits that the Court has consistently followed since <em>Buckley</em> was decided.  See <em>Hilton</em> v. <em>South Carolina Public Railways Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/197/index.html">502 U. S. 197</a>, 202 (1991).[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the contribution limits we upheld in <em>Buckley</em>, \xc2\xa7323\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions have only a marginal impact on the ability of contributors, candidates, officeholders, and parties to engage in effective political speech.  <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Complex as its provisions may be, \xc2\xa7323, in the main, does little more than regulate the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs contend that we must apply strict scrutiny to \xc2\xa7323 because many of its provisions restrict not only contributions but also the spending and solicitation of funds raised outside of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits.  But for purposes of determining the level of scrutiny, it is irrelevant that Congress chose in \xc2\xa7323 to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>National Right to Work, supra,</em> at 206\xe2\x80\x93211 (upholding a provision restricting PACs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to solicit funds).  The relevant inquiry is whether the mechanism adopted to implement the contribution limit, or to prevent circumvention of that limit, burdens speech in a way that a direct restriction on the contribution itself would not.  That is not the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, while \xc2\xa7323(a) prohibits national parties from receiving or spending nonfederal money, and \xc2\xa7323(b) prohibits state party committees from spending nonfederal money on federal election activities, neither provision in any way limits the total amount of money parties can spend.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(a), (b) (Supp. 2003).  Rather, they simply limit the source and individual amount of donations.  That they do so by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render them expenditure limitations.[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, the solicitation provisions of \xc2\xa7323(a) and \xc2\xa7323(e), which restrict the ability of national party committees, federal candidates, and federal officeholders to solicit nonfederal funds, leave open ample opportunities for soliciting federal funds on behalf of entities subject to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source and amount restrictions.  Even \xc2\xa7323(d), which on its face enacts a blanket ban on party solicitations of funds to certain tax-exempt organizations, nevertheless allows parties to solicit funds to the organizations\xe2\x80\x99 federal PACs.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(d).  As for those organizations that cannot or do not administer PACs, parties remain free to donate federal funds directly to such organizations, and may solicit funds expressly for that purpose.  See <em>infra</em>, at 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (construing \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on donations by parties to apply only to donations from a party committee\xe2\x80\x99s nonfederal or soft-money account).  And as with \xc2\xa7323(a), \xc2\xa7323(d) places no limits on other means of endorsing tax-exempt organizations or any restrictions on solicitations by party officers acting in their individual capacities.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(a), (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323 thus shows \xe2\x80\x9cdue regard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schaumburg</em> v. <em>Citizens for a Better Environment,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/620/index.html">444 U. S. 620</a>, 632 (1980).  The fact that party committees and federal candidates and officeholders must now ask only for limited dollar amounts or request that a corporation or union contribute money through its PAC in no way alters or impairs the political message \xe2\x80\x9cintertwined\xe2\x80\x9d with the solicitation.  Cf. <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 795 (1988) (treating solicitation restriction that required fundraisers to disclose particular information as a content-based regulation subject to strict scrutiny because it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily alter[ed] the content of the speech\xe2\x80\x9d).  And rather than chill such solicitations, as was the case in <em>Schaumburg</em>, the restriction here tends to increase the dissemination of information by forcing parties, candidates, and officeholders to solicit from a wider array of potential donors.  As with direct limits on contributions, therefore, \xc2\xa7323\xe2\x80\x99s spending and solicitation restrictions have only a marginal impact on political speech.[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, plaintiffs contend that the type of associational burdens that \xc2\xa7323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits, and merit the type of strict scrutiny we have applied to attempts to regulate the internal processes of political parties.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>California Democratic Party</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>, 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (2000).  In making this argument, plaintiffs greatly exaggerate the effect of \xc2\xa7323, contending that it precludes <em>any </em>collaboration among national, state, and local committees of the same party in fundraising and electioneering activities.  We do not read the provisions in that way.  See <em>infra</em>, at 51\xe2\x80\x9352.  Section 323 merely subjects a greater percentage of contributions to parties and candidates to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source and amount limitations.  <em>Buckley</em> has already acknowledged that such limitations \xe2\x80\x9cleave the contributor free to become a member of any political association and to assist personally in the association\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on behalf of candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 22.  The modest impact that \xc2\xa7323 has on the ability of committees within a party to associate with each other does not independently occasion strict scrutiny.  None of this is to suggest that the alleged associational burdens imposed on parties by \xc2\xa7323 have no place in the First Amendment analysis; it is only that we account for them in the application, rather than the choice, of the appropriate level of scrutiny.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these principles in mind, we apply the less rigorous scrutiny applicable to contribution limits to evaluate the constitutionality of new FECA \xc2\xa7323.  Because the five challenged provisions of \xc2\xa7323 implicate different First Amendment concerns, we discuss them separately.  We are mindful, however, that Congress enacted \xc2\xa7323 as an integrated whole to vindicate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s important interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>New FECA \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s Restrictions on National Party Committees</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The core of Title I is new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cnational committee[s] of a political party \xe2\x80\xa6 may not solicit, receive, or direct to another person a contribution, donation, or transfer of funds or any other thing of value, or spend any funds, that are not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U.

The idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or, at the very least, create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible.  For nearly 30 years, FECA has placed strict dollar limits and source restrictions on contributions that individuals and other entities can give to national, state, and local party committees for the purpose of influencing a federal election.  The premise behind these restrictions has been, and continues to be, that contributions to a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party in aid of that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign threaten to create\xe2\x80\x94no less than would a direct contribution to the candidate\xe2\x80\x94a sense of obligation.  See <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 38 (upholding FECA\xe2\x80\x99s $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to a candidate, political committee, and political party committee as a \xe2\x80\x9cquite modest restraint \xe2\x80\xa6 to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation\xe2\x80\x9d by, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9chuge contributions to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s political party\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is particularly true of contributions to national parties, with which federal candidates and officeholders enjoy a special relationship and unity of interest.  This close affiliation has placed national parties in a unique position, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether they like it or not,\xe2\x80\x9d to serve as \xe2\x80\x9cagents for spending on behalf of those who seek to produce obligated officeholders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado II</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 452; see also <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 406 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Respondent] asks us to evaluate his speech claim in the context of a system which favors candidates and officeholders whose campaigns are supported by <em>soft money, usually funneled through political parties</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  As discussed below, rather than resist that role, the national parties have actively embraced it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question for present purposes is whether large <em>soft-money </em>contributions to national party committees have a corrupting influence or give rise to the appearance of corruption.  Both common sense and the ample record in these cases confirm Congress\xe2\x80\x99 belief that they do.  As set forth above, <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313, and n.\xc2\xa07, the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s allocation regime has invited widespread circumvention of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limits on contributions to parties for the purpose of influencing federal elections.  Under this system, corporate, union, and wealthy individual donors have been free to contribute substantial sums of soft money to the national parties, which the parties can spend for the specific purpose of influencing a particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s federal election.  It is not only plausible, but likely, that candidates would feel grateful for such donations and that donors would seek to exploit that gratitude.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing intermediaries.  Thus, despite FECA\xe2\x80\x99s hard-money limits on direct contributions to candidates, federal officeholders have commonly asked donors to make soft-money donations to national and state committees \xe2\x80\x9csolely in order to assist federal campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d including the officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s own.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 472 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.)

The evidence connects soft money to manipulations of the legislative calendar, leading to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enact, among other things, generic drug legislation, tort reform, and tobacco legislation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 482 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id</em>., at 852 (Leon, J.); App. 390\xe2\x80\x93394 (declaration of Sen.

To claim that such actions do not change legislative outcomes surely misunderstands the legislative process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, plaintiffs conceive of corruption too narrowly.

These are not idle chit-chats about the philosophy of democracy\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

(same).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSo pervasive is this practice that the six national party committees actually furnish their own menus of opportunities for access to would-be soft-money donors, with increased prices reflecting an increased level of access.  For example, the DCCC offers a range of donor options, starting with the $10,000-per-year Business Forum program, and going up to the $100,000-per-year National Finance Board program.  The latter entitles the donor to bimonthly conference calls with the Democratic House leadership and chair of the DCCC, complimentary invitations to all DCCC fundraising events, two private dinners with the Democratic House leadership and ranking members, and two retreats with the Democratic House leader and DCCC chair in Telluride, Colorado, and Hyannisport, Massachusetts.  <em>Id</em>., at 504\xe2\x80\x93505 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); see also <em>id</em>., at 506 (describing records indicating that DNC offered meetings with President in return for large donations); <em>id</em>., at 502\xe2\x80\x93503 (describing RNC\xe2\x80\x99s various donor programs); <em>id</em>., at 503\xe2\x80\x93504 (same for NRSC); <em>id</em>., at 500\xe2\x80\x93503 (same for DSCC); <em>id</em>., at 504 (same for NRCC).  Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe RNC\xe2\x80\x99s donor programs offer greater access to federal office holders as the donations grow larger, with the highest level and most personal access offered to the largest soft money donors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 500\xe2\x80\x93503 (finding, further, that the RNC holds out the prospect of access to officeholders to attract soft-money donations and encourages officeholders to meet with large soft-money donors); accord, <em>id</em>., at 860\xe2\x80\x93861 (Leon, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this evidence and the close ties that candidates and officeholders have with their parties, Justice Kennedy would limit Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory interest <em>only </em>to the prevention of the actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption \xe2\x80\x9cinherent in\xe2\x80\x9d contributions made directly to, contributions made at the express behest of, and expenditures made in coordination with, a federal officeholder or candidate.  <em>Post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, 15.

This crabbed view of corruption, and particularly of the appearance of corruption, ignores precedent, common sense, and the realities of political fundraising exposed by the record in this litigation.[<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the First Amendment would render Congress powerless to address more subtle but equally dispiriting forms of corruption.  Just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the merits or the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder.  Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest.  And unlike  straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.  The best means of prevention is to identify and to remove the temptation.  The evidence set forth above, which is but a sampling of the reams of disquieting evidence contained in the record, convincingly demonstrates that soft-money contributions to political parties carry with them just such temptation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy likewise takes too narrow a view of the appearance of corruption.  He asserts that only those transactions with \xe2\x80\x9cinherent corruption potential,\xe2\x80\x9d which he again limits to contributions directly to candidates, justify the inference \xe2\x80\x9cthat regulating the conduct will stem the appearance of real corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 14.[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]  In our view, however, Congress is not required to ignore historical evidence regarding a particular practice or to view conduct in isolation from its context.  To be sure, mere political favoritism or opportunity for influence alone is insufficient to justify regulation.  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  As the record demonstrates, it is the manner in which parties have <em>sold </em>access to federal candidates and officeholders that has given rise to the appearance of undue influence.  Implicit (and, as the record shows, sometimes explicit) in the sale of access is the suggestion that money buys influence.  It is no surprise then that purchasers of such access unabashedly admit that they are seeking to purchase just such influence.  It was not unwarranted for Congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, there is substantial evidence to support Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination that large soft-money contributions to national political parties give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">2.<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New FECA \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s Restriction on Spending and \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Receiving Soft Money</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs and The</em> Chief Justice contend that \xc2\xa7323(a) is impermissibly overbroad because it subjects <em>all</em> funds raised and spent by national parties to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s hard-money source and amount limits, including, for example, funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.[<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  <em>Post</em>, 2\xe2\x80\x935 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).

This observation is beside the point.  Section 323(a), like the remainder of \xc2\xa7323, regulates <em>contributions,</em> not activities.

(quoting Mann Expert Report 29).  The national committees of the two major parties are both run by, and largely composed of, federal officeholders and candidates.  Indeed, of the six national committees of the two major parties, four are composed entirely of federal officeholders.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The nexus between national parties and federal officeholders prompted one of Title I\xe2\x80\x99s framers to conclude:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the national parties operate at the national level, and are inextricably intertwined with federal officeholders and candidates, who raise the money for the national party committees, there is a close connection between the funding of the national parties and the corrupting dangers of soft money on the federal political process.  The only effective way to address this [soft-money] problem of corruption is to ban entirely all raising and spending of soft money by the national parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. H409 (Feb. 13, 2002) (statement of Rep. Shays).</p>\n<p align="left">\nGiven this close connection and alignment of interests, large soft-money contributions to national parties are likely to create actual or apparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This close affiliation has also placed national parties in a position to sell access to federal officeholders in exchange for soft-money contributions that the party can then use for its own purposes.  Access to federal officeholders is the most valuable favor the national party committees are able to give in exchange for large donations.  The fact that officeholders comply by donating their valuable time indicates either that officeholders place substantial value on the soft-money contribution themselves, without regard to their end use, or that national committees are able to exert considerable control over federal officeholders.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 1196\xe2\x80\x931198 (Expert Report of Donald P. Green, Yale University) (\xe2\x80\x9cOnce elected to legislative office, public officials enter an environment in which political parties-in-government control the resources crucial to subsequent electoral success and legislative power.  Political parties organize the legislative caucuses that make committee assignments\xe2\x80\x9d); App. 1298 (Krasno &amp; Sorauf Expert Report) (indicating that officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 re-election prospects are significantly influenced by attitudes of party leadership).  Either way, large soft-money donations to national party committees are likely to buy donors preferential access to federal officeholders no matter the ends to which their contributions are eventually put.  As discussed above, Congress had sufficient grounds to regulate the appearance of undue influence associated with this practice.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s strong interests in preventing corruption, and in particular the appearance of corruption, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to the source, amount, and disclosure limitations of FECA.[<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3.<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New FECA \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s Restriction on Soliciting or \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Directing Soft Money</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also contend that \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on national parties\xe2\x80\x99 soliciting or directing soft-money contributions is substantially overbroad.

All activities that fall within the statutory definition must be funded with hard money.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(b)(2), the so-called Levin Amendment, carves out an exception to this general rule.  A refinement on the pre-BCRA regime that permitted parties to pay for certain activities with a mix of federal and nonfederal funds, the Levin Amendment allows state and local party committees to pay for certain types of federal election activity with an allocated ratio of hard money and \xe2\x80\x9cLevin funds\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, funds raised within an annual limit of $10,000 per person.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2).  Except for the $10,000 cap and certain related restrictions to prevent circumvention of that limit, \xc2\xa7323(b)(2) leaves regulation of such contributions to the States.[<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The scope of the Levin Amendment is limited in two ways.  First, state and local parties can use Levin money to fund only activities that fall within categories (1) and (2) of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of federal election activity\xe2\x80\x94namely, voter registration activity, voter identification drives, GOTV drives, and generic campaign activities.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(A).  And not all of these activities qualify: Levin funds cannot be used to pay for any activities that refer to \xe2\x80\x9ca clearly identified candidate for Federal office\xe2\x80\x9d; they likewise cannot be used to fund broadcast communications unless they refer \xe2\x80\x9csolely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, both the Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money used to pay for such activities must be raised entirely by the state or local committee that spends them.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv).  This means that a state party committee cannot use Levin funds transferred from other party committees to cover the Levin funds portion of a Levin Amendment expenditure.  It also means that a state party committee cannot use hard money transferred from other party committees to cover the hard-money portion of a Levin Amendment expenditure.  Furthermore, national committees, federal candidates, and federal officeholders generally may not solicit Levin funds on behalf of\nstate committees, and state committees may not team up to raise Levin funds.  \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(C).  They can, however, jointly raise the hard money used to make Levin expenditures.</p>\n<p align="left">1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Governmental Interests Underlying New FECA\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa7323(b)</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin by noting that, in addressing the problem of soft-money contributions to state committees, Congress both drew a conclusion and made a prediction.  Its conclusion, based on the evidence before it, was that the corrupting influence of soft money does not insinuate itself into the political process solely through national party committees.  Rather, state committees function as an alternate avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.[<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  Indeed, both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached the limit on their direct contributions to donate to state committees.[<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>]  There is at least as much evidence as there was in Buckley</em> that such donations have been made with the intent\xe2\x80\x94and in at least some cases the effect\xe2\x80\x94of gaining influence over federal officeholders.[<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>]  Section 323(b) thus promotes an important governmental interest by confronting the corrupting influence that soft-money donations to political parties already have.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress also made a prediction.  Having been taught the hard lesson of circumvention by the entire history of campaign finance regulation, Congress knew that soft-money donors would react to \xc2\xa7323(a) by scrambling to find another way to purchase influence.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cneither novel nor implausible,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 391, for Congress to conclude that political parties would react to \xc2\xa7323(a) by directing soft-money contributors to the state committees, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties.  We \xe2\x80\x9cmust accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 665 (1994), particularly when, as here, those predictions are so firmly rooted in relevant history and common sense.

They advance three main contentions in support of this proposition.  First, they argue that the provision is substantially overbroad because it federalizes activities that pose no conceivable risk of corrupting or appearing to corrupt federal officeholders.

As we explain below, \xc2\xa7323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that pose the greatest risk of this kind of corruption: those contributions to state and local parties that can be used to benefit federal candidates directly.  Further, these regulations all are reasonably tailored, with various temporal and substantive limitations designed to focus the regulations on the important anti-corruption interests to be served.  We conclude that \xc2\xa7323(b) is a closely-drawn means of countering both corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two categories of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity,\xe2\x80\x9d voter registration efforts, \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(i), and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal election, \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(ii), clearly capture activity that benefits federal candidates.  Common sense dictates, and it was \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed\xe2\x80\x9d below, that a party\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to register voters sympathetic to that party directly assist the party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates for federal office.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 460 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  It is equally clear that federal candidates reap substantial rewards from any efforts that increase the number of like-minded registered voters who actually go to the polls.[<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 459 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[The evidence] shows quite clearly that a campaign that mobilizes residents of a highly Republican precinct will produce a harvest of votes for Republican candidates for both state and federal offices.

[G]eneric campaign activity has a direct effect on federal elections\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Green Expert Report 14)).

See <em>id.</em>, at 459 (quoting a letter thanking a California Democratic Party donor and noting that CDP\xe2\x80\x99s voter registration and GOTV efforts would help \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98increase the number of Californian Democrats in the United States Congress\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliver California\xe2\x80\x99s 54 electoral votes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the Democratic presidential candidate).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because voter registration, voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity all confer substantial benefits on federal candidates, the funding of such activities creates a significant risk of actual and apparent corruption.  Section 323(b) is a reasonable response to that risk.  Its contribution limitations are focused on the subset of voter registration activity that is most likely to affect the election prospects of federal candidates: activity that occurs within 120 days before a federal election.  And if the voter registration drive does not specifically\nmention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii) (Supp. 2003).  Similarly, the contribution limits applicable to \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(ii) activities target only those voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign efforts that occur \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with an election in which a candidate for a Federal office appears on the ballot.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7431(20)(A)(ii).  Appropriately, in implementing this subsection, the FEC has categorically excluded all activity that takes place during the run-up to elections when no federal office is at stake.[<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]  Furthermore, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s higher contribution limits to fund any \xc2\xa7301(A)(20)(i) and \xc2\xa7301(A)(20)(ii) activities that do not specifically mention a federal candidate.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).  The prohibition on the use of soft money in connection with these activities is therefore closely drawn to meet the sufficiently important governmental interests of avoiding corruption and its appearance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPublic communications\xe2\x80\x9d that promote or attack a candidate for federal office\xe2\x80\x94the third category of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(iii)\xe2\x80\x94also undoubtedly have a dramatic effect on federal elections.  Such ads were a prime motivating force behind BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  See 3 1998 Senate Report 4535 (additional views of Sen. Collins) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he hearings provided overwhelming evidence that the twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue advertising have virtually destroyed our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble\xe2\x80\x9d).  As explained below, any public communication that promotes or attacks a clearly identified federal candidate directly affects the election in which he is participating.  The record on this score could scarcely be more abundant.  Given the overwhelming tendency of public communications, as carefully defined in \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(iii), to benefit directly federal candidates, we hold that application of \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s contribution caps to such communications is also closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.[<a href="#F64" name="T64">Footnote 64</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the final category of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal election activity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(iv), we find that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in preventing circumvention of \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s other restrictions justifies the requirement that state and local parties spend federal funds to pay the salary of any employee spending more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities in connection with a federal election.  In the absence of this provision, a party might use soft money to pay for the equivalent of a full-time employee engaged in federal electioneering, by the simple expedient of dividing the federal workload among multiple employees.  Plaintiffs have suggested no reason for us to strike down this provision.  Accordingly, we give \xe2\x80\x9cdeference to [the] congressional determination of the need for [this] prophylactic rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.</em>, 470 U.

We recognize, as we have in the past, the importance of preserving the associational freedom of parties.

But not every minor restriction on parties\xe2\x80\x99 otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension.  See <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, we note that state and local parties can avoid these associational burdens altogether by forgoing the Levin Amendment option and electing to pay for federal election activities entirely with hard money.  But in any event, the restrictions on the use, transfer, and raising of Levin funds are justifiable anticircumvention measures.  Without the ban on transfers of Levin funds among state committees, donors could readily circumvent the $10,000 limit on contributions to a committee\xe2\x80\x99s Levin account by making multiple $10,000 donations to various committees that could then transfer the donations to the committee of choice.[<a href="#F65" name="T65">Footnote 65</a>]  The same anticircumvention goal undergirds the ban on joint solicitation of Levin funds.  Without this restriction, state and local committees could organize \xe2\x80\x9call hands\xe2\x80\x9d fundraisers at which individual, corporate, or union donors could make large soft-money donations to be divided between the committees.  In that case, the purpose, if not the letter, of \xc2\xa7323(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s $10,000 limit would be thwarted: Donors could make large, visible contributions at fundraisers, which would provide ready means for corrupting federal officeholders.  Given the delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme at issue here, any associational burdens imposed by the Levin Amendment restrictions are far outweighed by the need to prevent circumvention of the entire scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(b)(2)(B)(iv)\xe2\x80\x99s apparent prohibition on the transfer of hard money by a national, state, or local committee to help fund the allocable hard-money portion of a separate state or local committee\xe2\x80\x99s Levin expenditures presents a closer question.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(b)(2)(B)(iv) (Supp. 2003).  The Government defends the restriction as necessary to prevent the donor committee, particularly a national committee, from leveraging the transfer of federal money to wrest control over the spending of the recipient committee\xe2\x80\x99s Levin funds.  This purported interest is weak, particularly given the fact that \xc2\xa7323(a) already polices attempts by national parties to engage in such behavior.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(a)(2) (extending \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions to entities <em>controlled</em> by national party committees).  However, the associational burdens posed by the hard-money transfer restriction are so insubstantial as to be <em>de minimis</em>.  Party committees, including national party committees, remain free to transfer unlimited hard money so long as it is not used to fund Levin expenditures.  State and local party committees can thus dedicate all \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown\xe2\x80\x9d hard money to their Levin activities while relying on outside transfers to defray the costs of other hard-money expenditures.  Given the strong anticircumvention interest vindicated by \xc2\xa7323(b)(2)(B)(iv)\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on the transfer of Levin funds, we will not strike down the entire provision based upon such an attenuated claim of associational infringement.</p>\n<p align="left">c.<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New FECA \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s Impact on Parties\xe2\x80\x99 Ability\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0to Engage in Effective Advocacy</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, plaintiffs contend that \xc2\xa7323(b) is unconstitutional because its restrictions on soft-money contributions to state and local party committees will prevent them from engaging in effective advocacy.

Yet, by soliciting the donations to third-party organizations, the parties would avoid FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source-and-amount limitations, as well as its disclosure restrictions.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 348 (Henderson, J.) (citing various declarations demonstrating that, prior to BCRA, most tax-exempt organizations did not disclose the source or amount of contributions); <em>id</em>., at 521 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Experience under the current law demonstrates that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about circumvention are not merely hypothetical.  Even without the added incentives created by Title I, national, state, and local parties already solicit unregulated soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations for the purpose of supporting federal electioneering activity.  See<em>, e.g.,</em> 3 1998 Senate Report 4013 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to direct contributions from the RNC to nonprofit groups, the senior leadership of the RNC helped to raise funds for many of the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s nonprofit organizations\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 5983 (minority views) (\xe2\x80\x9cTax-exempt \xe2\x80\x98issue advocacy\xe2\x80\x99 groups and other conduits were systematically used to circumvent federal campaign finance laws\xe2\x80\x9d); 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 517 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id</em>., at 848 (Leon, J.).  Parties and candidates have also begun to take advantage of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpolitician 527s,\xe2\x80\x9d which are little more than soft-money fronts for the promotion of particular federal officeholders and their interests.  See <em>id.,</em> at 519 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Virtually every member of Congress in a formal leadership position has his or her own 527 group\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. In all, Public Citizen found 63 current members of Congress who have their own 527s\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Public Citizen Congress Watch, Congressional Leaders\xe2\x80\x99 Soft Money Accounts Show Need for Campaign Finance Reform Bills, Feb. 26, 2002, p. 6)); 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 849\xe2\x80\x93850 (Leon, J.).  These 527s have been quite successful at raising substantial sums of soft money from corporate interests, as well as from the national parties themselves.  See <em>id.</em>, at 519\xe2\x80\x93520 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding that 27 industries had each donated over $100,000 in a single year to the top 25 politician 527 groups and that the DNC was the single largest contributor to politician 527 groups (citing Public Citizen Congress Watch, <em>supra,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311)); 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 850 (Leon, J.) (same).  Given BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives for parties to exploit such organizations will only increase.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation restriction is closely drawn to prevent political parties from using tax-exempt organizations as soft-money surrogates.  Though phrased as an absolute prohibition, the restriction does nothing more than subject contributions solicited by parties to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory regime, leaving open substantial opportunities for solicitation and other expressive activity in support of these organizations.  First, and most obviously, \xc2\xa7323(d) restricts solicitations only to those \xc2\xa7501(c) groups \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] expenditures or disbursements in connection with an election for Federal office,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(d)(1) (Supp. 2003), and to \xc2\xa7527 organizations, which by definition engage in partisan political activity, \xc2\xa7441i(d)(2); 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7527(e).  Second, parties remain free to solicit hard-money contributions to a \xc2\xa7501(c)\xe2\x80\x99s federal PAC, as well as to \xc2\xa7527 organizations that already qualify as federal PACs.[<a href="#F69" name="T69">Footnote 69</a>]  Third, \xc2\xa7323(d) allows parties to endorse qualifying organizations in ways other than direct solicitations of unregulated donations.  For example, with respect to \xc2\xa7501(c) organizations that are prohibited from administering PACs, parties can solicit hard-money donations to themselves for the express purpose of donating to these organizations.  See <em>supra</em>, at 72\xe2\x80\x9373.  Finally, as with \xc2\xa7323(a), \xc2\xa7323(d) in no way restricts solicitations by party officers acting in their individual capacities.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(d) (extending restrictions to solicitations and donations made by \xe2\x80\x9can officer or agent acting <em>on behalf of </em>any such party committee\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In challenging \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on solicitations, plaintiffs renew the argument they made with respect to \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation restrictions: that it cannot be squared with \xc2\xa7323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited donations of soft money to tax-exempt organizations that engage in federal election activities.  Compare 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(d) with \xc2\xa7441i(e)(4).  But if \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on solicitations are otherwise valid, they are not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have.  See <em>National Right to Work</em>, 459 U. S., at 210; see also <em>Katzenbach</em> v. <em>Morgan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/641/index.html">384 U. S. 641</a>, 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (1966).  In any event, the difference between the two provisions is fully explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, are able to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities.  Section 323(e), which is designed to accommodate the individual associational and speech interests of candidates and officeholders in lending personal support to nonprofit organizations, also places tight content, source, and amount restrictions on solicitations of soft money by federal candidates and officeholders.  Given those limits, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, the greater allowances of \xc2\xa7323(e) do not render \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation restriction facially invalid.</p>\n<p align="left">2.<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New FECA \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s Regulation of Donations</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(d) also prohibits national, state, and local party committees from making or directing \xe2\x80\x9cany donatio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d to qualifying \xc2\xa7501(c) or \xc2\xa7527 organizations.  2 U.

Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectly\xe2\x80\x94\nnamely, raising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities.

Parties have many valid reasons for giving to tax-exempt organizations, not the least of which is to associate themselves with certain causes and, in so doing, to demonstrate the values espoused by the party.  A complete ban on donations prevents parties from making even the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral expression of support\xe2\x80\x9d that a contribution represents.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 21.  At the same time, prohibiting parties from donating funds already raised in compliance with FECA does little to further Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government asserts that the restriction is necessary to prevent parties from leveraging their hard money to gain control over a tax-exempt group\xe2\x80\x99s soft money.  Even if we accepted that rationale, it would at most justify a dollar limit, not a flat ban.  Moreover, any legitimate concerns over capture are diminished by the fact that the restrictions set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a) and (b) apply not only to party committees, but to entities under their control.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(a)(2) (extending prohibitions on national party committees to \xe2\x80\x9cany entity that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, <em>or controlled</em> by such a national committee\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa7441i(b)(1) (same for state and local party committees).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These observations do not, however, require us to sustain plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge to \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s donation restriction.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and \xe2\x80\xa6 a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U.

Given our obligation to avoid constitutional problems, we narrowly construe \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.  This construction is consistent with the concerns animating Title I, whose purpose is to plug the soft-money loophole.  Though there is little legislative history regarding BCRA generally, and almost nothing on \xc2\xa7323(d) specifically, the abuses identified in the 1998 Senate report regarding campaign finance practices involve the use of nonprofit organizations as conduits for large <em>soft-money </em>donations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 3 1998 Senate Report 4565 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe evidence indicates that the soft-money loophole is fueling many of the campaign abuses investigated by the Committee\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Soft money also supplied the funds parties used to make contributions to tax-exempt groups, which in turn used the funds to pay for election-related activities\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 4568\xe2\x80\x934569 (describing as an \xe2\x80\x9cegregious exampl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of misuse a $4.6 million donation of nonfederal funds by the RNC to Americans for Tax Reform, which the organization spent on \xe2\x80\x9cdirect mail and phone bank operations to counter anti-Republican advertising\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have found no evidence that Congress was concerned about, much less that it intended to prohibit, donations of money already fully regulated by FECA.  Given Title I\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive focus on abuses related to soft money, we would expect that if Congress meant \xc2\xa7323(d)\xe2\x80\x99s restriction to have this dramatic and constitutionally questionable effect, it would say so explicitly.  Because there is nothing that compels us to conclude that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cdonations\xe2\x80\x9d to include transfers of federal money, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, we decline to read \xc2\xa7323(d) in that way.  Thus, political parties remain free to make or direct donations of money to any tax-exempt organization that has otherwise been raised in compliance with FECA.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>New FECA \xc2\xa7323(e)\xe2\x80\x99s Restrictions on Federal Candidates and Officeholders</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New FECA \xc2\xa7323(e) regulates the raising and soliciting of soft money by federal candidates and officeholders.  2 U.

Even on the narrowest reading of <em>Buckley</em>, a regulation restricting donations to a federal candidate, regardless of the ends to which those funds are ultimately put, qualifies as a contribution limit subject to less rigorous scrutiny.  Such donations have only marginal speech and associational value, but at the same time pose a substantial threat of corruption.  By severing the most direct link between the soft-money donor and the federal candidate, \xc2\xa7323(e)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on donations of soft money is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(e)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on solicitations are justified as valid anticircumvention measures.  Large soft-money donations at a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s or officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder.  Though the candidate may not ultimately control how the funds are spent, the value of the donation to the candidate or officeholder is evident from the fact of the solicitation itself.  Without some restriction on solicitations, federal candidates and officeholders could easily avoid FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits by soliciting funds from large donors and restricted sources to like-minded organizations engaging in federal election activities.  As the record demonstrates, even before the passage of BCRA, federal candidates and officeholders had already begun soliciting donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their party\xe2\x80\x99s, electoral cause.  See <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 458 (quoting fundraising letter from a Congressman explaining to contributor that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98you are at the limit of what you can directly contribute to my campaign,\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98you can further help my campaign by assisting the Colorado Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 479\xe2\x80\x93480 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.)

Rather than place an outright ban on solicitations to tax-exempt organizations, \xc2\xa7323(e)(4) permits limited solicitations of soft money.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(e)(4).  This allowance accommodates individuals who have long served as active members of nonprofit organizations in both their official and individual capacities.  Similarly, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(e)(1)(B) and 323(e)(3) preserve the traditional fundraising role of federal officeholders by providing limited opportunities for federal candidates and officeholders to associate with their state and local colleagues through joint fundraising activities.  2 U.

And, by regulating only contributions used to fund \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communications,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7323(f) focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs advance two principal arguments against \xc2\xa7323(f).  We have already rejected the first argument, that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communications\xe2\x80\x9d in new FECA \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(iii) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

The proliferation of sham issue ads has driven the soft-money explosion.  Parties have sought out every possible way to fund and produce these ads with soft money: They have labored to bring them under the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s allocation regime; they have raised and transferred soft money from national to state party committees to take advantage of favorable allocation ratios; and they have transferred and solicited funds to tax-exempt organizations for production of such ads.  We will not upset Congress\xe2\x80\x99 eminently reasonable prediction that, with these other avenues no longer available, state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding of sham issue advertising.

S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa74, and, by impairing the authority of the States to regulate their own elections, violates constitutional principles of federalism.  In examining congressional enactments for infirmity under the Tenth Amendment, this Court has focused its attention on laws that commandeer the States and state officials in carrying out federal regulatory schemes. See<em> Printz </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U.

By contrast, Title I of BCRA only regulates the conduct of private parties.  It imposes no requirements whatsoever upon States or state officials, and, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, it leaves the States free to enforce their own restrictions on the financing of state electoral campaigns.  It is true that Title I, as amended, prohibits some fundraising tactics that would otherwise be permitted under the laws of various States, and that it may therefore have an indirect effect on the financing of state electoral campaigns.  But these indirect effects do not render BCRA unconstitutional.  It is not uncommon for federal law to prohibit private conduct that is legal in some States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/483/index.html">532 U. S. 483</a> (2001).  Indeed, such conflict is inevitable in areas of law that involve both state and federal concerns.  It is not in and of itself a marker of constitutional infirmity.

S. 598</a> (2000); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U. S. 549</a> (1995).  But plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA.  Congress has a fully legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of federal officeholders and preventing corruption of federal electoral processes through the means it has chosen.  Indeed, our above analysis turns on our finding that those interests are sufficient to satisfy First Amendment scrutiny.  Given that finding, we cannot conclude that those interests are insufficient to ground Congress\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of its Elections Clause power.  See <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 607 (respect owed to coordinate branches \xe2\x80\x9cdemands that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, plaintiffs argue that Title I violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it discriminates against political parties in favor of special interest groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Sierra Club.  As explained earlier, BCRA imposes numerous restrictions on the fundraising abilities of political parties, of which the soft-money ban is only the most prominent.  Interest groups, however, remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications).  We conclude that this disparate treatment does not offend the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, we note that BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways.  Most obviously, party committees are entitled to receive individual contributions that substantially exceed FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limits on contributions to nonparty political committees; individuals can give $25,000 to political party committees whereas they can give a maximum of $5,000 to nonparty political committees.  In addition, party committees are entitled in effect to contribute to candidates by making coordinated expenditures, and those expenditures may greatly exceed the contribution limits that apply to other donors.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(d) (Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, however, Congress is fully entitled to consider the real-world differences between political parties and interest groups when crafting a system of campaign finance regulation.  See <em>National Right to Work</em>, 459 U. S., at 210.  Interest groups do not select slates of candidates for elections.  Interest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative committees, elect congressional leadership, or organize legislative caucuses.  Political parties have influence and power in the legislature that vastly exceeds that of any interest group.  As a result, it is hardly surprising that party affiliation is the primary way by which voters identify candidates, or that parties in turn have special access to and relationships with federal officeholders.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts at campaign finance regulation may account for these salient differences.  Taken seriously, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection arguments would call into question not just Title I of BCRA, but much of the pre-existing structure of FECA as well.  We therefore reject those arguments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it upheld \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(e) and 323(f).  We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it invalidated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a), 323(b), and 323(d).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title II of BCRA, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cNoncandidate Campaign Expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d is divided into two subtitles: \xe2\x80\x9cElectioneering Communications\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIndependent and Coordinated Expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  We consider each challenged section of these subtitles in turn.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>BCRA \xc2\xa7201\xe2\x80\x99s Definition of \xe2\x80\x9cElectioneering Communication\xe2\x80\x9d</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first section of Title II, \xc2\xa7201, comprehensively amends FECA \xc2\xa7304, which requires political committees to file detailed periodic financial reports with the FEC.

As discussed further below, that construction limited the coverage of FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.  By contrast, the term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d is not so limited, but is defined to encompass any \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication\xe2\x80\x9d that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(I) refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(II) is made within\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(aa) 60 days before a general, special, or runoff election for the office sought by the candidate; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(bb) 30 days before a primary or preference election, or a convention or caucus of a political party that has authority to nominate a candidate, for the office sought by the candidate; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(III) in the case of a communication which refers to a candidate other than President or Vice President, is targeted to the relevant electorate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U.

BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s use of this new term is not, however, limited to the disclosure context: A later section of the Act (BCRA \xc2\xa7203, which amends FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2)) restricts corporations\xe2\x80\x99 and labor unions\xe2\x80\x99 funding of electioneering communications.  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the new term as it applies in both the disclosure and the expenditure contexts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The major premise of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d is that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers possess an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.  Thus, plaintiffs maintain, Congress cannot constitutionally require disclosure of, or regulate expenditures for, \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d without making an exception for those \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications\xe2\x80\x9d that do not meet <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s definition of express advocacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That position misapprehends our prior decisions, for the express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.  In <em>Buckley</em> we began by examining then-18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which restricted expenditures \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relative to a clearly identified candidate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and we found that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relative to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was impermissibly vague.  424 U. S., at 40\xe2\x80\x9342<em>.  </em>We concluded that the vagueness deficiencies could \xe2\x80\x9cbe avoided only by reading \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) as limited to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F74" name="T74">Footnote 74</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 43.  We provided examples of words of express advocacy, such as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98vote for,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98elect,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98support,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98defeat,\xe2\x80\x99 [and] \xe2\x80\x98reject,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 44, n. 52, and those examples eventually gave rise to what is now known as the \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We then considered FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure provisions, including 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431(f) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which defined \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expenditur[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to include the use of money or other assets \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for the purpose of \xe2\x80\xa6 influencing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a federal election.  <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.

Finding that the \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity of this phrase\xe2\x80\x9d posed \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional problems,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> we noted our \xe2\x80\x9cobligation to construe the statute, if that can be done consistent with the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, to avoid the shoals of vagueness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 77\xe2\x80\x9378 (citations omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cTo insure that the reach\xe2\x80\x9d of the disclosure requirement was \xe2\x80\x9cnot impermissibly broad, we construe[d] \xe2\x80\x98expenditure\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of that section in the same way we construed the terms of \xc2\xa7608(e)\xe2\x80\x94to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 80 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, a plain reading of <em>Buckley</em> makes clear that the express advocacy limitation, in both the expenditure and the disclosure contexts, was the product of statutory interpretation rather than a constitutional command.[<a href="#F75" name="T75">Footnote 75</a>]  In narrowly reading the FECA provisions in <em>Buckley</em> to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth, we nowhere suggested that a statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line.  Nor did we suggest as much in <em>MCFL,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html">479 U. S. 238</a> (1986), in which we addressed the scope of another FECA expenditure limitation and confirmed the understanding that <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express advocacy category was a product of statutory construction.[<a href="#F76" name="T76">Footnote 76</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the concept of express advocacy and the concomitant class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional infirmities.  See <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/490/index.html">440 U. S. 490</a>, 500 (1979) (citing <em>Murray</em> v. <em>Schooner Charming Betsy</em>, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804)).  We have long \xe2\x80\x9crigidly adhered\xe2\x80\x9d to the tenet \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U.

Beam Distilling Co.</em> v. <em>Georgia,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/529/index.html">501 U. S. 529</a>, 547 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Consistent with that principle, our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we persuaded, independent of our precedents, that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy.  That notion cannot be squared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.  See <em>Buckley, supra</em>, at 45.  Indeed, the unmistakable lesson from the record in this litigation, as all three judges on the District Court agreed, is that <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s magic-words requirement is functionally meaningless.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (Henderson, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 534 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 875\xe2\x80\x93879 (Leon, J.).  Not only can advertisers easily evade the line by eschewing the use of magic words, but they would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted.[<a href="#F77" name="T77">Footnote 77</a>]  And although the resulting advertisements do not urge the viewer to vote for or against a candidate in so many words, they are no less clearly intended to influence the election.[<a href="#F78" name="T78">Footnote 78</a>]  <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express advocacy line, in short, has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found in the existing system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally we observe that new FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d raises none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis in <em>Buckley</em>.  The term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d applies only (1) to a broadcast (2) clearly identifying a candidate for federal office, (3) aired within a specific time period, and (4) targeted to an identified audience of at least 50,000 viewers or listeners.  These components are both easily understood and objectively determinable.  See <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/104/index.html">408 U. S. 104</a>, 108\xe2\x80\x93114 (1972).  Thus, the constitutional objection that persuaded the Court in <em>Buckley</em> to limit FECA\xe2\x80\x99s reach to express advocacy is simply inapposite here.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>BCRA \xc2\xa7201\xe2\x80\x99s Disclosure Requirements</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having rejected the notion that the First Amendment requires Congress to treat so-called issue advocacy differently from express advocacy, we turn to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 other concerns about the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d in amended FECA \xc2\xa7304\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure provisions.  Under those provisions, whenever any person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 during any calendar year for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications, he must file a statement with the FEC identifying the pertinent elections and all persons sharing the costs of the disbursements.  2 U.

The District Court rejected the former submission but accepted the latter, finding invalid new FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(5), which governs executory contracts.  Relying on BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s severability provision,[<a href="#F80" name="T80">Footnote 80</a>] the court held that invalidation of the executory contracts subsection did not render the balance of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to FECA \xc2\xa7304 unconstitutional.  251 F.

Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 disdain for BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure pro-visions is nothing short of surprising.  Plaintiffs chal-lenge BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on electioneering communications on the premise that they should be permitted to spend corporate and labor union general treasury funds in the sixty days before the federal elections on broadcast advertisements, which refer to federal candidates, because speech needs to be \xe2\x80\x98uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\xe2\x80\x99  McConnell Br. at 44 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U.

Curiously, Plaintiffs want to preserve the ability to run these advertisements while hiding behind dubious and misleading names like:  \xe2\x80\x98The Coalition-Americans Working for Real Change\xe2\x80\x99 (funded by business organizations opposed to organized labor), \xe2\x80\x98Citizens for Better Medicare\xe2\x80\x99 (funded by the pharmaceutical industry), \xe2\x80\x98Republicans for Clean Air\xe2\x80\x99 (funded by brothers Charles and Sam Wyly).

McConnell Br. at 44.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument for striking down BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure provisions does not reinforce the precious First Amendment values that Plaintiffs argue are trampled by BCRA, but ignores the competing First Amendment interests of individual citizens seeking to make informed choices in the political marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 237.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court was also correct that <em>Buckley</em> forecloses a facial attack on the new provision in \xc2\xa7304 that requires disclosure of the names of persons contributing $1,000 or more to segregated funds or individuals that spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications.  Like our earlier decision in <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Patterson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/index.html">357 U.

The District Court noted that some parties had expressed such concerns, but it found a \xe2\x80\x9clack of specific evidence about the basis for these concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 247 <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We agree, but we note that, like our refusal to recognize a blanket exception for minor parties in <em>Buckley,</em> our rejection of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge to the requirement to disclose individual donors does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also are unpersuaded by plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to new FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(5), which requires disclosure of executory contracts for electioneering communications:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cContracts to disburse</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of this subsection, a person shall be treated as having made a disbursement if the person has executed a contract to make the disbursement.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434(f)(5) (Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn our view, this provision serves an important purpose the District Court did not advance.  BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to FECA \xc2\xa7304 mandate disclosure only if and when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.  Plaintiffs do not take issue with the use of a dollar amount, rather than the number or dates of the ads, to identify the time when a person paying for electioneering communications must make disclosures to the FEC.  Nor do they question the need to make the contents of parties\xe2\x80\x99 disclosure statements available to curious voters in advance of elections.  Given the relatively short time frames in which electioneering communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made promptly and in time to provide relevant information to voters is unquestionably significant.  Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole if advertisers were not required to disclose executory contracts.  In the absence of that requirement, political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures concerning ads slated to run during the final week of a campaign simply by making a preelection downpayment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election.  Indeed, if the advertiser waited to pay that balance until the next calendar year then, as long as the balance did not itself exceed $10,000, the advertiser might avoid the disclosure requirements completely.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record contains little evidence identifying any harm that might flow from the enforcement of \xc2\xa7304(f)(5)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadvance\xe2\x80\x9d disclosure requirement.  The District Court speculated that disclosing information about contracts \xe2\x80\x9cthat have not been performed, and may never be performed, may lead to confusion and an unclear record upon which the public will evaluate the forces operating in the political marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 241 <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Without evidence relating to the frequency of nonperformance of executed contracts, such speculation cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place.  It is no doubt true that \xc2\xa7304(f)(5) will sometimes require the filing of disclosure statements in advance of the actual broadcast of an advertisement.[<a href="#F84" name="T84">Footnote 84</a>]  But the same would be true in the absence of an advance disclosure requirement, if a television station insisted on advance payment for all of the ads covered by a contract.  Thus, the possibility that amended \xc2\xa7304 may sometimes require disclosures prior to the airing of an ad is as much a function of the use of disbursements (rather than the date of an ad) to trigger the disclosure requirement as it is a function of \xc2\xa7304(f)(5)\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of executory contracts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the District Court observed, amended FECA \xc2\xa7304\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements are constitutional because they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98d[o] not prevent anyone from speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting Brief for FEC in Opposition in No. 02\xe2\x80\x93582 et\xc2\xa0al. (DC), p.\xc2\xa0112).  Moreover, the required disclosures \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would not have to reveal the specific content of the advertisements, yet they would perform an important function in informing the public about various candidates\xe2\x80\x99 supporters <em>before </em>election day.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 241 (quoting Brief for FEC in Opposition, <em>supra</em>, at 112) (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it upheld the disclosure requirements in amended FECA \xc2\xa7304 and rejected the facial attack on the provisions relating to donors of $1,000 or more, and reverse that judgment insofar as it invalidated FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(5).</p>\n<p align="left"><em>BCRA \xc2\xa7202\xe2\x80\x99s Treatment of \xe2\x80\x9cCoordinated Communications\xe2\x80\x9d as Contributions</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 202 of BCRA amends FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party.  2 U.

BCRA \xc2\xa7202 pre-empts a possible claim that \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B) is similarly limited, such that coordinated expenditures for communications that avoid express advocacy cannot be counted as contributions.  As we explained above, see <em>supra</em>, at 83\xe2\x80\x9386, <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrow interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditure\xe2\x80\x9d was not a constitutional limitation on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate federal elections.  Accordingly, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats all other coordinated expenditures.  We affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it held that plaintiffs had advanced \xe2\x80\x9cno basis for finding Section 202 unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 250.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>BCRA \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x99s Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements for Electioneering Communications</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since our decision in Buckley</em>, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.  The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds authorized by FECA \xc2\xa7316, 2 U.

Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is \xe2\x80\x9csimply wrong\xe2\x80\x9d to view the provision as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete ban\xe2\x80\x9d on expression rather than a regulation.  <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U.

Our consideration of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is informed by our earlier conclusion that the distinction between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled.  In that light, we must examine the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluate whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden.  <em>Id., </em>at 657.  The latter question\xe2\x80\x94whether the state interest is compelling\xe2\x80\x94is easily answered by our prior decisions regarding campaign finance regulation, which \xe2\x80\x9crepresent respect for the \xe2\x80\x98legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beaumont</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting <em>National Right to Work,</em> 459 U.

Nor do they contend that the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.  After all, \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Monitor Patriot Co.</em> v. <em>Roy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/index.html">401 U. S. 265</a>, 272 (1971), and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]dvocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 48.  Rather, plaintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions and have that effect.  The precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were aired during those relatively brief preelection time spans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the District Court.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 307\xe2\x80\x93312 (Henderson, J.); <em>id</em>., at 583\xe2\x80\x93587 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id</em>., at 796\xe2\x80\x93798 (Leon, J.).  Nevertheless, the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose.  Annenberg Report 13\xe2\x80\x9314; App. 1330\xe2\x80\x931348 (Krasno &amp; Sorauf Expert Report); 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 573\xe2\x80\x93578 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id</em>., at 826\xe2\x80\x93827 (Leon, J.).  Moreover, whatever the precise percentage may have been in the past, in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads during those time frames by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.[<a href="#F88" name="T88">Footnote 88</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are therefore not persuaded that plaintiffs have carried their heavy burden of proving that amended FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2) is overbroad.  See <em>Broadrick</em> v. <em>Oklahoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/index.html"></a><a href="/us/413/601/index.html">413 U. S. 601</a>, 613 (1973).  Even if we assumed that BCRA will inhibit some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech, that assumption would not \xe2\x80\x9cjustify prohibiting all enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the law unless its application to protected speech is substantial, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the scope of the law\xe2\x80\x99s plainly legitimate applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>539 U. S. ___, ___ (2003) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Far from establishing that BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also argue that FECA \xc2\xa7316(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s segregated-fund requirement for electioneering communications is underinclusive because it does not apply to advertising in the print media or on the Internet.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A) (Supp. 2003).  The records developed in this litigation and by the Senate Committee adequately explain the reasons for this legislative choice.  Congress found that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the periods immediately preceding federal elections, and that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 569\xe2\x80\x93573 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id</em>., at 799 (Leon, J.); 3 1998 Senate Report 4465, 4474\xe2\x80\x934481; 5 <em>id.,</em> at 7521\xe2\x80\x937525.  As we held in <em>Buckley, </em>\xe2\x80\x9creform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 105 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  One might just as well argue that the electioneering communication definition is underinclusive because it leaves advertising 61 days in advance of an election entirely unregulated.  The record amply justifies Congress\xe2\x80\x99 line drawing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to arguing that \xc2\xa7316(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive, some plaintiffs contend that it unconstitutionally discriminates in favor of media companies.  FECA \xc2\xa7304(f)(3)(B)(i) excludes from the definition of electioneering communications any \xe2\x80\x9ccommunication appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(B)(i) (Supp. 2003).  Plaintiffs argue this provision gives free rein to media companies to engage in speech without resort to PAC money.  Section 304(f)(3)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s effect, however, is much narrower than plaintiffs suggest.  The provision excepts news items and commentary only; it does not afford <em>carte blanche</em> to media companies generally to ignore FECA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s narrow exception is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles.  \xe2\x80\x9cA valid distinction \xe2\x80\xa6 exists between corporations that are part of the media industry and other corporations that are not involved in the regular business of imparting news to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin,</em> 494 U. S., at 668.  Numerous federal statutes have drawn this distinction to ensure that the law \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not hinder or prevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing editorials about, newsworthy events.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

If political fundraising events are expressly denominated as requests for contributions that will be used for political purposes, including direct expenditures, these events cannot be considered business activities.  This ensures that political resources reflect political support.  <em>Second</em>, it has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on its assets or earnings.  This ensures that persons connected with the organization will have no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity.  <em>Third</em>, MCFL was not established by a business corporation or a labor union, and it is its policy not to accept contributions from such entities.  This prevents such corporations from serving as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 264.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That FECA \xc2\xa7316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt <em>MCFL</em> organizations from its prohibition is not a sufficient reason to invalidate the entire section.  If a reasonable limiting construction \xe2\x80\x9chas been or could be placed on the challenged statute\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid constitutional concerns, we should embrace it.  <em>Broadrick,</em> 413 U. S., at 613; <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 44.  Because our decision in the <em>MCFL</em> case was on the books for many years before BCRA was enacted, we presume that the legislators who drafted \xc2\xa7316(c)(6) were fully aware that the provision could not validly apply to <em>MCFL</em>-type entities.  See <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Massachusetts,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/879/index.html">487 U.

All three judges on the District Court concluded that the provision placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 right to make unlimited independent expenditures.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 388 (Henderson, J.); id.</em>, at 650\xe2\x80\x93651 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.), <em>id.</em>, at 805\xe2\x80\x93808 (Leon, J.).

Section 315(a)(2) restricts \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions\xe2\x80\x9d by parties to $5,000 per candidate.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(a)(2).  Because \xc2\xa7315(a)(7) treats expenditures that are coordinated with a candidate as contributions to that candidate, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441(a)(7) (Supp. 2003), the $5,000 limit also operates as a cap on parties\xe2\x80\x99 coordinated expenditures.  Section 315(d), however, provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law with respect to limitations on expenditures or limitations on contributions,\xe2\x80\x9d political parties may make \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditures\xe2\x80\x9d in support of their candidates under a formula keyed to the voting-age population of the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s home State or, in the case of a candidate for President, the voting-age population of the United States.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441a(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (main ed. and Supp. 2003).[<a href="#F94" name="T94">Footnote 94</a>]  In the year 2000, that formula permitted expenditures ranging from $33,780 to $67,650 for House of Representatives races, and from $67,650 to $1.6 million for Senate races.  <em>Colorado II, </em>533 U. S., at 439, n.\xc2\xa03.  We held in <em>Colorado I</em> that parties have a constitutional right to make unlimited independent expenditures, and we invalidated \xc2\xa7315(d) to the extent that it restricted such expenditures.  As a result of that decision, \xc2\xa7315(d) applies only to coordinated expenditures, replacing the $5,000 cap on contributions set out in \xc2\xa7315(a)(2) with the more generous limitations prescribed by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  We sustained that limited application in <em>Colorado II, supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 213 of BCRA amends \xc2\xa7315(d) by adding a new paragraph (4).  New \xc2\xa7315(d)(4)(A) provides that, after a party nominates a candidate for federal office, it must choose between two spending options.  Under the first option, a party that \xe2\x80\x9cmakes any independent expenditure (as defined in section [301(17)])\xe2\x80\x9d is thereby barred from making \xe2\x80\x9cany coordinated expenditure under this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(d)(4)(A)(i) (Supp. 2003).  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthis subsection\xe2\x80\x9d is a reference to subsection (d) of \xc2\xa7315.  Thus, the consequence of making an independent expenditure is not a complete prohibition of any coordinated expenditure: Although the party cannot take advantage of the increased spending limits under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), it still may make up to $5,000 in coordinated expenditures under \xc2\xa7315(a)(2).  As the difference between $5,000 and $1.6 million demonstrates, however, that is a significant cost to impose on the exercise of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second option is the converse of the first.  It provides that a party that makes any coordinated expenditure \xe2\x80\x9cunder this subsection\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, one that exceeds the ordinary $5,000 limit) cannot make \xe2\x80\x9cany independent expenditure (as defined in section [301(17)]) with respect to the candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(d)(4)(A)(ii).  Section 301(17) defines \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98independent expenditure\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to mean a non-coordinated expenditure \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7431(17)(A).[<a href="#F95" name="T95">Footnote 95</a>]  Therefore, as was true of the first option, the party\xe2\x80\x99s choice is not as stark as it initially appears: The consequence of the larger coordinated expenditure is not a complete prohibition of any independent expenditure, but the forfeiture of the right to make independent expenditures <em>for express advocacy</em>.  As we explained in our discussion of the provisions relating to electioneering communications, <em>supra</em>, at 83\xe2\x80\x9387, express advocacy represents only a tiny fraction of the political communications made for the purpose of electing or defeating candidates during a campaign.  Regardless of which option parties choose, they remain free to make independent expenditures for the vast majority of campaign ads that avoid the use of a few magic words. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the coverage of new FECA \xc2\xa7315(d)(4) is much more limited than it initially appears.  A party that wishes to spend more than $5,000 in coordination with its nominee is forced to forgo only the narrow category of independent expenditures that make use of magic words.  But while the category of burdened speech is relatively small, it plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection.  See <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345, 48.  Under \xc2\xa7315(d)(4), a political party\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its constitutionally protected right to engage in \xe2\x80\x9ccore First Amendment expression,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 48, results in the loss of a valuable statutory benefit that has been available to parties for many years.  To survive constitutional scrutiny, a provision that has such consequences must be supported by a meaningful governmental interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The interest in requiring political parties to avoid the use of magic words is not such an interest.  We held in <em>Buckley</em> that a $1,000 cap on expenditures that applied only to express advocacy could not be justified as a means of avoiding circumvention of contribution limits or preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption because its restrictions could easily be evaded: \xe2\x80\x9cSo long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.  The same is true in this litigation.  Any claim that a restriction on independent express advocacy serves a strong Government interest is belied by the overwhelming evidence that the line between express advocacy and other types of election-influencing expression is, for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes, functionally meaningless.  Indeed, Congress enacted the new \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication[s]\xe2\x80\x9d provisions precisely because it recognized that the express advocacy test was woefully inadequate at capturing communications designed to influence candidate elections.  In light of that recognition, we are hard pressed to conclude that any meaningful purpose is served by \xc2\xa7315(d)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s burden on a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to engage independently in express advocacy.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that \xc2\xa7315(d)(4) nevertheless is constitutional because it is not an outright ban (or cap) on independent expenditures, but rather offers parties a voluntary choice between a constitutional right and a statutory benefit.  Whatever merit that argument might have in the abstract, it fails to account for new \xc2\xa7315(d)(4)(B), which provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of this paragraph, all political committees established and maintained by a national political party (including all congressional campaign committees) and all political committees established and maintained by a State political party (including any subordinate committee of a State committee) shall be considered to be a single political committee.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441a(d)(4)(B) (Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that provision, it simply is not the case that each party committee can make a voluntary and independent choice between exercising its right to engage in independent advocacy and taking advantage of the increased limits on coordinated spending under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7315(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  Instead, the decision resides solely in the hands of the first mover, such that a local party committee can bind both the state and national parties to its chosen spending option.[<a href="#F96" name="T96">Footnote 96</a>]  It is one thing to say that Congress may require a party committee to give up its right to make independent expenditures if it believes that it can accomplish more with coordinated expenditures.  It is quite another thing, however, to say that the RNC must limit itself to $5,000 in coordinated expenditures in support of its presidential nominee if any state or local committee first makes an independent expenditure for an ad that uses magic words.  That odd result undermines any claim that new \xc2\xa7315(d)(4) can withstand constitutional scrutiny simply because it is cast as a voluntary choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The portion of the judgment of the District Court invalidating BCRA \xc2\xa7213 is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>BCRA \xc2\xa7214\xe2\x80\x99s Changes in FECA\xe2\x80\x99s Provisions Covering Coordinated Expenditures</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ever since our decision in Buckley</em>, it has been settled that expenditures by a noncandidate that are \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign\xe2\x80\x9d may be treated as indirect contributions subject to FECA\xe2\x80\x99s source and amount limitations.  424 U.

Plaintiffs point out that political supporters may be subjected to criminal liability if they exceed the contribution limits with expenditures that ultimately are deemed coordinated.  Thus, they stress the importance of a clear definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d and argue any definition that does not hinge on the presence of an agreement cannot provide the \xe2\x80\x9cprecise guidance\xe2\x80\x9d that the First Amendment demands.  Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States et\xc2\xa0al., Appellant in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931756, p. 48.  As plaintiffs readily admit, that argument reaches beyond BCRA, calling into question FECA\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing provisions governing expenditures coordinated with candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded that the presence of an agreement marks the dividing line between expenditures that are coordinated\xe2\x80\x94and therefore may be regulated as indirect contributions\xe2\x80\x94and expenditures that truly are independent.  We repeatedly have struck down limitations on expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cmade totally independently of the candidate and his campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 47, on the ground that such limitations \xe2\x80\x9cimpose far greater restraints on the freedom of speech and association\xe2\x80\x9d than do limits on contributions and coordinated expenditures, <em>id.</em>, at 44, while \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ing] to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  See also <em>Colorado I,</em> 518 U. S., at 613\xe2\x80\x93614 (striking down limit on expenditure made by party officials prior to nomination of candidates and without any consultation with potential nominees).  We explained in <em>Buckley:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike contributions, \xe2\x80\xa6 independent expenditures may well provide little assistance to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive.

S., at 47.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the rationale for affording special protection to wholly independent expenditures has nothing to do with the absence of an agreement and everything to do with the functional consequences of different types of expenditures.  Independent expenditures \xe2\x80\x9care poor sources of leverage for a spender because they might be duplicative or counterproductive from a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado II, </em>533 U.

For that reason, Congress has always treated expenditures made \xe2\x80\x9cat the request or suggestion of\xe2\x80\x9d a candidate as coordinated.[<a href="#F99" name="T99">Footnote 99</a>]  2 U.

A supporter easily could comply with a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s request or suggestion without first agreeing to do so, and the resulting expenditure would be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98virtually indistinguishable from [a] simple contributio[n],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Colorado II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 444\xe2\x80\x93445.  Therefore, we cannot agree with the submission that new FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is overbroad because it permits a finding of coordination or cooperation notwithstanding the absence of a pre-existing agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we persuaded that the absence of an agreement requirement renders \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague.  An agreement has never been required to support a finding of coordination with a candidate under \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(i), which refers to expenditures made \xe2\x80\x9cin cooperation, consultation, or concer[t] with, or at the request or suggestion of\xe2\x80\x9d a candidate.  Congress used precisely the same language in new \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) to address expenditures coordinated with parties.  FECA\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding definition of coordination \xe2\x80\x9cdelineates its reach in words of common understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cameron</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/611/index.html">390 U. S. 611</a>, 616 (1968).  Not surprisingly, therefore, the relevant statutory language has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades.  Although that fact does not insulate the definition from constitutional scrutiny, it does undermine plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the language of \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is intolerably vague.  Plaintiffs do not present any evidence that the definition has chilled political speech, whether between candidates and their supporters or by the supporters to the general public.  See <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 874 (1997) (noting risk that vague statutes may chill protected expression).  And, although plaintiffs speculate that the FEC could engage in intrusive and politically motivated investigations into alleged coordination, they do not even attempt to explain why an agreement requirement would solve that problem.  Moreover, the only evidence plaintiffs have adduced regarding the enforcement of the coordination provision during its 27-year history concerns three investigations in the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s into groups on different sides of the political aisle.  Such meager evidence does not support the claim that \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) will \xe2\x80\x9cfoster \xe2\x80\x98arbitrary and discriminatory application.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 41, n. 48 (quoting <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, 408 U.

We conclude that FECA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of coordination gives \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice to those to whom [it] is directed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>American Communications Assn.</em> v. <em>Douds,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/382/index.html">339 U.

As the District Court explained, issues concerning the regulations are not appropriately raised in this facial challenge to BCRA, but must be pursued in a separate proceeding.  Thus, we agree with the District Court that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that the alleged constitutional infirmities are found in the implementing regulations rather than the statute itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The portions of the District Court judgment rejecting plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to BCRA \xc2\xa7214 are affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many years ago we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard \xe2\x80\xa6 an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burroughs</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 290 U.

The challengers have made no attempt to explain away the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s own contrary conclusions and the mass of evidence in related FCC records and proceedings.  <em>E.g.</em>, 57 Fed.

Because we cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, we likewise cannot strike down the \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate request\xe2\x80\x9d provision in BCRA \xc2\xa7504; for the latter simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BCRA \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celection message request\xe2\x80\x9d requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the public) to broadcast a \xe2\x80\x9cmessage\xe2\x80\x9d about \xe2\x80\x9ca legally qualified candidate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cany election to Federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d 47 U.

Although these requirements are somewhat broader than the \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate request\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, they serve much the same purposes.  A candidate\xe2\x80\x99s supporters or opponents  account for many of the requests to broadcast \xe2\x80\x9cmessage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about a \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Requests to broadcast messages about an \xe2\x80\x9celection\xe2\x80\x9d may include messages that favor one candidate or another, along with other messages that may be more neutral.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the nature of many of the messages, recordkeeping can help both the regulatory agencies and the public evaluate broadcasting fairness, and determine the amount of money that individuals or groups, supporters or opponents, intend to spend to help elect a particular candidate.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 100\xe2\x80\x93101 (joint opinion) (upholding stringent restrictions on <em>all </em>election-time advertising that refers to a candidate because such advertising will <em>often</em> convey message of support or opposition).  Insofar as the request is to broadcast neutral material about a candidate or election, the disclosure can help the FCC carry out other statutory functions, for example, determining whether a broadcasting station is fulfilling its licensing obligation to broadcast material important to the community and the public.  47 U.

They ask the broadcaster to keep information about the disposition of the request, and information identifying the individual or company requesting the broadcast time (name, address, contact information, or, if the requester is not an individual, the names of company officials).  47 U.

Regardless, the information should prove readily available, for the individual requesting a broadcast must provide it to the broadcaster should the broadcaster accept the request.  47 CFR \xc2\xa773.1212(e) (2002).  And as we have previously pointed out, the recordkeeping requirements do not reach significantly beyond other FCC\nrecordkeeping rules, for example, those requiring broadcasting licensees to keep material showing com-\npliance with their license-related promises to broad-\ncast material on issues of public importance. See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa773.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements for issues important to the community); <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (collecting regulations); <em>Office of Communication of United Church of Christ</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, 707 F.\xc2\xa02d 1413, 1421\xe2\x80\x931422 (CADC 1983) (describing FCC rules, in force during 1960\xe2\x80\x931981, that required nonentertainment programming in 14 specific areas and mandated publicly available records detailing date, time, source, and description to substantiate compliance).

On the one hand, the burdens are likely less heavy than many that other FCC regulations have imposed, for example, the burden of keeping and disclosing \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll written comments and suggestions\xe2\x80\x9d received from the public, including every e-mail.  47 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa773.1202, 73.3526(e)(9) (2002); see also <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  On the other hand, the burdens are likely heavier than those imposed by BCRA \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions, previously discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulatory burden, in practice, will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies this provision.  The FCC has adequate legal authority to write regulations that may limit, and make more specific, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s potential linguistic reach.  47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7315(d).  It has often ameliorated regulatory burdens by interpretation in the past, and there is no reason to believe it will not do so here.  See 14 FCC Rcd. 4653, \xc2\xb6  ;25 (1999) (relaxing the recordkeeping requirements in respect to cable systems that serve fewer than 5,000 subscribers); 14 FCC Rcd. 11121, \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;20\xe2\x80\x9322 (1999) (requiring candidates to inspect the political file at a station rather than requiring licensees to send out photocopies of the files to candidates upon telephone request). The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC in regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Any such challenge will likely provide greater information about the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 justifications and administrative burdens.  Without that additional information, we cannot now say that the burdens are so great, or the justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding the provisions unconstitutional on their face.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The McConnell plaintiffs and The Chief Justice make one final claim.  They say that the \xe2\x80\x9cissue request\xe2\x80\x9d requirement will force them to disclose information that will reveal their political strategies to opponents, perhaps prior to a broadcast.  See <em>post</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (dissenting opinion).  We are willing to assume that the Constitution includes some form of protection against premature disclosure of campaign strategy\xe2\x80\x94though, given the First Amendment interest in free and open discussion of campaign issues, we make this assumption purely for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake.  Nonetheless, even on that assumption we do not see how BCRA \xc2\xa7504 can be unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the statute requires disclosure of names, addresses, and the fact of a request; it does not require disclosure of substantive campaign content.  See 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7315(e)(2) (Supp. 2003).  For another, the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7315(e)(3), would seem to permit FCC disclosure-timing rules that would avoid any premature disclosure that the Constitution itself would forbid.  Further, the plaintiffs do not point to\xe2\x80\x94and our own research cannot find\xe2\x80\x94any specific indication of such a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy-disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d problem arising during the past 65 years in respect to the existing FCC \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate request\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, where the strategic problem might be expected to be more acute.  Finally, we today reject an analogous facial attack\xe2\x80\x94premised on speculations of \xe2\x80\x9cadvance disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94on a similar BCRA provision.  See <em>ante</em>, at 94 (joint opinion).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d argument does not show that BCRA \xc2\xa7504 is unconstitutional on its face, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when \xc2\xa7504 is applied.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice makes two important arguments in response to those we have set forth.  First, he says that we \xe2\x80\x9capproac[h] \xc2\xa7504 almost exclusively from the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association rights are affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11 (dissenting opinion).  The Chief Justice is certainly correct in emphasizing the importance of the speech interests of candidates and other potential speakers, but we have not ignored their First Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cperspective.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the contrary, we have discussed the speakers\xe2\x80\x99 interests together with the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99 interests because the two sets of interests substantially overlap.  For example, the speakers\xe2\x80\x99 vagueness argument is no different from the broadcasters\xe2\x80\x99, and it fails for the same reasons, <em>e.g.</em>, the fact that BCRA \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s language is just as definite and precise as other language that we today uphold.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have separately discussed the <em>one and only</em> speech-related claim advanced on behalf of candidates (or other speakers) that differs from the claims set forth by the broadcasters.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  This is the claim that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements will require candidates to reveal their political strategies to opponents.  We just said, and we now repeat, that BCRA \xc2\xa7504 can be applied, in a significant number of cases, without requiring any such political-strategy disclosure\xe2\x80\x94either because disclosure in many cases will not create any such risk or because the FCC may promulgate rules requiring disclosure only after any such risk disappears, or both.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, candidates (or other speakers) whom \xc2\xa7504 affects adversely in this way (or in other ways) remain free to challenge the lawfulness of FCC implementing regulations and to challenge the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7504 as applied.  To find that the speech-related interests of candidates and others may be vindicated in an as-applied challenge is not to \xe2\x80\x9cignor[e]\xe2\x80\x9d those interests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, The Chief Justice says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government, in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support \xc2\xa7504 as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cpre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing similar disclosure requirements\xe2\x80\x9d cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccompel the conclusion that \xc2\xa7504 is constitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d nor somehow \xe2\x80\x9crelieve the Government of its burden of advancing a constitutionally sufficient justification for \xc2\xa7504.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again The Chief Justice is correct in saying that the mere <em>existence </em>of similar FCC regulation-imposed requirements\xe2\x80\x94even if unchallenged for at least 65 years\xe2\x80\x94cannot prove that those requirements are constitutional.  But the existence of those regulations means that we must read beyond the briefs in this case before holding those requirements unconstitutional.  Before evaluating the relevant burdens and justifications, we must at least become acquainted with the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s own view of the matter.  We must follow the Government\xe2\x80\x99s regulation-related references to the relevant regulatory records, related FCC regulatory conclusions, and the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement experience.  We must take into account, for example, the likelihood that the <em>reason </em>there is \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the record that indicates licensees have treated purchasers unfairly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 13 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting), is that for many decades similar FCC regulations have made that unfair treatment unlawful.  And, if we are to avoid disrupting related agency law, we must evaluate what we find in agency records and related experience before holding this similar statutory provision unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even a superficial examination of those relevant agency materials reveals strong supporting justifications, and a lack of significant administrative burdens.  And any additional burden that the statute, viewed facially, imposes upon interests protected by the First Amendment seems slight compared to the strong enforcement-related interests that it serves.  Given the FCC regulations and their history, the statutory requirements must survive a <em>facial </em>attack under any potentially applicable First Amendment standard, including that of heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why the regulations are relevant.  That is why the brevity of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s discussion here cannot be determinative.  That is why we fear that The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view would lead us into an unfortunate\xe2\x80\x94and at present unjustified\xe2\x80\x94revolution in communications law.  And that is why we disagree with his dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The portion of the judgment of the District Court invalidating BCRA \xc2\xa7504 is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title 47 U.

Rather, the issue is whether Congress can permissibly regulate much speech that has no plausible connection to candidate contributions or corruption to achieve those goals.  Under our precedent, restrictions on political contributions implicate important First Amendment values and are constitutional only if they are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to reduce the corruption of federal candidates or the appearance of corruption.  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 26\xe2\x80\x93\n27 (1976) <em>(per curiam).  </em>Yet, the Court glosses over the breadth of the restrictions, characterizing Title I of BCRA as \xe2\x80\x9cdo[ing] little more that regulat[ing] the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28 (joint opinion of Stevens and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, JJ.).  Because, in reality, Title I is much broader than the Court allows, regulating a good deal of speech that does <em>not</em> have the potential to corrupt federal candidates and officeholders, I dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lynchpin of Title I, new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a), prohibits national political party committees from \xe2\x80\x9csolicit[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdirect[ing] to another person,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspend[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d <em>any</em> funds not subject to federal regulation, even if those funds are used for nonelection related activities.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(a)(1) (Supp. 2003).  The Court concludes that such a restriction is justified because under FECA, \xe2\x80\x9cdonors have been free to contribute substantial sums of soft money to the national parties, which the parties can spend for the specific purpose of influencing a particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s federal election.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36.  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not only plausible, but likely, that candidates would feel grateful for such donations and that donors would seek to exploit that gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But the Court misses the point.  Certainly \xe2\x80\x9cinfusions of money into [candidates\xe2\x80\x99] campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/index.html">470 U. S. 480</a>, 497 (1985), can be regulated, but \xc2\xa7323(a) does not regulate only donations given to influence a particular federal election; it regulates <em>all donations</em> to national political committees, no matter the use to which the funds are put.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court attempts to sidestep the unprecedented breadth of this regulation by stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties\xe2\x80\x9d makes all donations to the national parties \xe2\x80\x9csuspect.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante, </em>at 45.  But a close association with others, especially in the realm of political speech, is not a surrogate for corruption; it is one of our most treasured First Amendment rights.  See <em>California Democratic Party</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>, 574 (2000); <em>Eu</em> v. <em>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/214/index.html">489 U. S. 214</a>, 225 (1989); <em>Tashjian</em> v. <em>Republican Party of Conn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/index.html">479 U. S. 208</a>, 214 (1986).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to impute corruption on the basis of a relationship greatly infringes associational rights and expands Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to regulate political speech.  And there is nothing in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis that limits congressional regulation to national political parties.  In fact, the Court relies in part on this closeness rationale to regulate <em>nonprofit organizations</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348, n.\xc2\xa051.  Who knows what association will be deemed too close to federal officeholders next.  When a donation to an organization has no potential to corrupt a federal officeholder, the relationship between the officeholder and the organization is simply irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court fails to recognize that the national political parties are exemplars of political speech at all levels of government, in addition to effective fundraisers for federal candidates and officeholders.  For sure, national political party committees exist in large part to elect federal candidates, but as a majority of the District Court found, they also promote coordinated political messages and participate in public policy debates unrelated to federal elections, promote, even in off-year elections, state and local candidates and seek to influence policy at those levels, and increase public participation in the electoral process.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 334\xe2\x80\x93337 (DC 2003) <em>(per curiam) </em>(Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 820\xe2\x80\x93821 (Leon, J.).  Indeed, some national political parties exist primarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate.  App. 185\xe2\x80\x93186 (declaration of Stephen L. Dasbach et al. \xc2\xb6  ;11 (describing Libertarian Party)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As these activities illustrate, political parties often foster speech crucial to a healthy democracy, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 820 (Leon, J.), and fulfill the need for like-minded individuals to ban together and promote a political philosophy, see <em>Jones,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 574; <em>Eu</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 225.  When political parties engage in pure political speech that has little or no potential to corrupt their federal candidates and officeholders, the government cannot constitutionally burden their speech any more than it could burden the speech of individuals engaging in these same activities.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 496\xe2\x80\x93497; <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing</em> v. <em>Berkeley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/290/index.html">454 U. S. 290</a>, 297\xe2\x80\x93298 (1981); <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 27.  Notwithstanding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s citation to the numerous abuses of FECA, under any definition of \xe2\x80\x9cexacting scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d the means chosen by Congress, restricting all donations to national parties no matter the purpose for which they are given or are used, are not \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s overinclusiveness is not limited to national political parties.  To prevent the circumvention of the ban on the national parties\xe2\x80\x99 use of nonfederal funds, BCRA extensively regulates state parties, primarily state elections, and state candidates.  For example, new FECA \xc2\xa7323(b), by reference to new FECA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii), prohibits state parties from using nonfederal funds[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] for general partybuilding activities such as voter registration, voter identification, and get out the vote for state candidates even if federal candidates are not mentioned.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(b), 431(20)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii) (Supp. 2003).  New FECA \xc2\xa7323(d) prohibits state and local political party committees, like their national counterparts, from soliciting and donating \xe2\x80\x9cany funds\xe2\x80\x9d to nonprofit organizations such as the National Rifle Association or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(d).  And, new FECA \xc2\xa7323(f) requires a state gubernatorial candidate to abide by federal funding restrictions when airing a television ad that tells voters that, if elected, he would oppose the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy of increased oil and gas exploration within the State because it would harm the environment.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7441i(f), 431(20)(A)(iii) (regulating \xe2\x80\x9cpublic communication[s] that refe[r] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office (regardless of whether a candidate for State or local office is also mentioned or identified) and that \xe2\x80\xa6 attacks or opposes a candidate for that office\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although these provisions are more focused on activities that may <em>affect</em> federal elections, there is scant evidence in the record to indicate that federal candidates or officeholders are corrupted or would appear corrupted by donations for these activities.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 403, 407, 416, 422 (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 779\xe2\x80\x93780, 791 (Leon, J.); see also <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html">518 U.

Nonetheless, the Court concludes that because these activities <em>benefit</em> federal candidates and officeholders, see <em>ante</em>, at 59 or prevent the circumvention of pre-existing or contemporaneously enacted restrictions,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] see <em>ante</em>, at 57, 67, 71, 78, it must defer to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98predictive judgments of Congress,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 57 (quoting <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 665 (1994)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet the Court cannot truly mean what it says.  Newspaper editorials and political talk shows <em>benefit</em> federal candidates and officeholders every bit as much as a generic voter registration drive conducted by a state party; there is little doubt that the endorsement of a major newspaper <em>affects</em> federal elections, and federal candidates and officeholders are surely \xe2\x80\x9cgrateful,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 60, for positive media coverage.  I doubt, however, the Court would seriously contend that we must defer to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 judgment if it chose to reduce the influence of political endorsements in federal elections.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/index.html">418 U. S. 241</a>, 247, 250 (1974) (holding unconstitutional a state law that required newspapers to provide \xe2\x80\x9cright to reply\xe2\x80\x9d to any candidate who was personally or professionally assailed in order to eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cabuses of bias and manipulative reportage\xe2\x80\x9d by the press).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also true that any circumvention rationale ultimately must rest on the circumvention itself leading to the corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  See <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 38 (upholding restrictions on funds donated to national political parties \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of influencing any election for a Federal office\xe2\x80\x9d because they were prophylactic measures designed \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent evasion\xe2\x80\x9d of the contribution limit on <em>candidates</em>).  All political speech that is not sifted through federal regulation circumvents the regulatory scheme to some degree or another, and thus by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard would be a \xe2\x80\x9cloophole\xe2\x80\x9d in the current system.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Unless the Court would uphold federal regulation of all funding of political speech, a rationale dependent on circumvention alone will not do.  By untethering its inquiry from corruption or the appearance of corruption, the Court has removed the touchstone of our campaign finance precedent and has failed to replace it with any logical limiting principle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But such an untethering is necessary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Only by using amorphous language to conclude a federal interest, however vaguely defined, exists can the Court avoid the obvious fact that new FECA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a), (b), (d), and (f\xc2\xa0) are vastly overinclusive.  Any campaign finance law aimed at reducing corruption will almost surely affect federal elections or prohibit the circumvention of federal law, and if broad enough, most laws will generally reduce some appearance of corruption.  Indeed, it is precisely because broad laws are likely to nominally further a legitimate interest that we require Congress to tailor its restrictions; requiring all federal candidates to self-finance their campaigns would surely reduce the appearance of donor corruption, but it would hardly be constitutional.  In allowing Congress to rely on general principles such as affecting a federal election or prohibiting the circumvention of existing law, the Court all but eliminates the \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d tailoring requirement and meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No doubt Congress was convinced by the many abuses of the current system that something in this area must be done.  Its response, however, was too blunt.  Many of the abuses described by the Court involve donations that were made for the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of influencing a federal election,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus are already regulated.  See <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Congress could have sought to have the existing restrictions enforced or to enact other restrictions that are \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d to its legitimate concerns.  But it should not be able to broadly restrict political speech in the fashion it has chosen.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, by not requiring tailored restrictions, has significantly reduced the protection for political speech having little or nothing to do with corruption or the appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BCRA \xc2\xa7504 amends \xc2\xa7315 of the Communications Act to require broadcast licensees to maintain and disclose records of any <em>request</em> to purchase broadcast time that \xe2\x80\x9cis made by or on behalf of a legally qualified candidate for public office\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicates a message relating to any political matter of national importance,\xe2\x80\x9d including communications relating to \xe2\x80\x9ca legally qualified candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cany election to Federal office,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca national legislative issue of public importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  BCRA \xc2\xa7504; 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7315(e)(1) (Supp. 2003).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This section differs from other BCRA disclosure sections because it requires <em>broadcast licensees </em>to disclose <em>requests</em> to purchase broadcast time rather than requiring <em>purchasers</em> to disclose their <em>disbursements</em> for broadcast time.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, BCRA \xc2\xa7201.  The Court concludes that \xc2\xa7504 \xe2\x80\x9cmust survive a <em>facial </em>attack under any potentially applicable First Amendment standard, including that of heightened scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  I disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This section is deficient because of the absence of a sufficient governmental interest to justify disclosure of mere requests to purchase broadcast time, as well as purchases themselves.  The Court approaches \xc2\xa7504 almost exclusively from the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association rights are affected by \xc2\xa7504.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 5 (noting that broadcasters are subject to numerous recordkeeping requirements); <em>ante</em>, at 7 (opining that this Court has recognized \xe2\x80\x9cbroad governmental authority for agency information demands from regulated entities\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e cannot say that these requirements will impose disproportionate administrative burdens\xe2\x80\x9d).  An approach that simply focuses on whether the administrative burden is justifiable is untenable.  Because \xc2\xa7504 impinges on core First Amendment rights, it is subject to a more demanding test than mere rational-basis review.  The Court applies the latter by asking essentially whether there is any conceivable reason to support \xc2\xa7504.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (discussing the ways in which the disclosure \xe2\x80\x9ccan help\xe2\x80\x9d the FCC and the public); <em>ante</em>, at 10 (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9crecordkeeping requirements seem likely to help the FCC\xe2\x80\x9d enforce the fairness doctrine).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Required disclosure provisions that deter constitutionally protected association and speech rights are subject to heightened scrutiny.  See <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 64.  When applying heightened scrutiny, we first ask whether the Government has asserted an interest sufficient to justify the disclosure of requests to purchase broadcast time.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see <em>ante</em>, at 89 (joint opinion of Stevens and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, JJ.) (concluding that the important state interests the <em>Buckley</em> Court held justified FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements apply to BCRA \xc2\xa7201\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirement).  But the Government, in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support \xc2\xa7504 as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 7 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief does not succinctly present interests sufficient to support \xc2\xa7504.  The two paragraphs that the Court relies on provide the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs explained in the government\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to the motion for summary affirmance on this issue filed by plaintiff National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), longstanding FCC regulations impose disclosure requirements with respect to the sponsorship of broadcast matter \xe2\x80\x98involving the discussion of a controversial issue of public importance.\xe2\x80\x99  47 C.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. 73.1212(d) and (e) (2002); see 47 C.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. 76.1701(d) (2002) (same standard used in disclosure regulation governing cablecasting).  By enabling viewers and listeners to identify the persons actually responsible for communications aimed at a mass audience, those regulations assist the public in evaluating the message transmitted.  See <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S. at 792 n.\xc2\xa032 (\xe2\x80\x98Identification of the source of advertising may be required \xe2\x80\xa6 so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.\xe2\x80\x99).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe range of information required to be disclosed under BCRA \xc2\xa7504 is comparable to the disclosures mandated by pre-existing FCC rules.  Compare 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 315(e)(2)(G) (added by BCRA \xc2\xa7504), with 47 C.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. 73.1212(e) and 76.1701(d) (2002).  Plaintiffs do not attempt to show that BCRA \xc2\xa7504\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are more onerous than the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding rules, nor do they contend that the pre-existing agency regulations are themselves unconstitutional.  See generally 02\xe2\x80\x931676 Gov\xe2\x80\x99t Br. in Opp. to Mot. of NAB for Summ. Aff. 4\xe2\x80\x939.  Because BCRA \xc2\xa7504 is essentially a codification of established and unchallenged regulatory requirements, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment claim should be rejected.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for FEC et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931674 et\xc2\xa0al., pp.\xc2\xa0132\xe2\x80\x93133; <em>ante, </em>at 7.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhile these paragraphs attempt to set forth a justification for the new Communications Act \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(B), discussed below, I fail to see any justification for BCRA \xc2\xa7504 in its entirety.  Nor do I find persuasive the Court\xe2\x80\x99s and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that pre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing similar disclosure requirements compel the conclusion that \xc2\xa7504 is constitutional and somehow relieve the Government of its burden of advancing a constitutionally sufficient justification for \xc2\xa7504.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At oral argument, the Government counsel indicated that one of the interests supporting \xc2\xa7504 in its entirety stems from the fairness doctrine, Tr. of Oral Arg. 192, which in general imposes an obligation on licensees to devote a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable percentage\xe2\x80\x9d of broadcast time to issues of public importance in a way that reflects opposing views.  See <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>FCC,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/index.html">395 U. S. 367</a> (1969).  Assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, this latter-day assertion should be considered, I think the District Court correctly noted that there is nothing in the record that indicates licensees have treated purchasers unfairly.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 812 (Leon, J.).  In addition, this interest seems wholly unconnected to the central purpose of BCRA, and it is not at all similar to the governmental interests\nin <em>Buckley</em> that we found to be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\nto outweigh the possibility of infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 66.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the disclosure requirements involving \xe2\x80\x9cany political matter of national importance\xe2\x80\x9d under the new Communications Act \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(B), the Government suggests that the disclosure enables viewers to evaluate the message transmitted.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  First, insofar as BCRA \xc2\xa7504 requires reporting of \xe2\x80\x9crequest[s for] broadcast time\xe2\x80\x9d as well as actual broadcasts, it is not supported by this goal.  Requests that do not mature into actual purchases will have no viewers, but the information may allow competitors or adversaries to obtain information regarding organizational or political strategies of purchasers.  Second, even as to broadcasts themselves, in this noncandidate-related context, this goal is a far cry from the Government interests endorsed in <em>Buckley</em>, which were limited to evaluating and preventing corruption of federal candidates.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>McIntyre</em> v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/334/index.html">514 U. S. 334</a>, 354 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to disclosure requirements with respect to candidates under the new Communications Act \xc2\xa7315(e)(1)(A), BCRA \xc2\xa7504 significantly overlaps with \xc2\xa7201, which is today also upheld by this Court, <em>ante</em>, at 87\xe2\x80\x9395 (joint opinion of Stevens and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, JJ.), and requires purchasers of \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communications\xe2\x80\x9d to disclose a wide array of information, including the amount of each disbursement and the elections to which electioneering communications pertain.  While I recognize that there is this overlap, \xc2\xa7504 imposes a different burden on the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment rights: as noted above, \xc2\xa7201 is limited to <em>purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 </em>disclosure of <em>disbursements</em> for electioneering communications, whereas \xc2\xa7504 requires <em>broadcast licensees\xe2\x80\x99 </em>disclosure of <em>requests</em> for broadcast time by purchasers.  Not only are the purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 requests, which may never result in an actual advertisement, subject to the disclosure requirements, but \xc2\xa7504 will undoubtedly result in increased costs of communication because the licensees will shift the costs of the onerous disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to purchasers.  The Government fails to offer a reason for the separate burden and apparent overlap.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government cannot justify, and for that matter, has not attempted to justify, its requirement that \xe2\x80\x9crequest[s for] broadcast\xe2\x80\x9d time be publicized.  On the record before this Court, I cannot even speculate as to a governmental interest that would allow me to conclude that the disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9crequests\xe2\x80\x9d should be upheld.  Such disclosure risks, <em>inter alia</em>, allowing candidates and political groups the opportunity to ferret out a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s political strategy and, ultimately, unduly burdens the First Amendment freedoms of purchasers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent some showing of a Government interest served by \xc2\xa7504 and in light of the breadth of disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9crequests,\xe2\x80\x9d I must conclude that \xc2\xa7504 fails to satisfy First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join this opinion in its\nentirety.</p>\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court points out that state parties may use Levin funds for certain activities.

Indeed, although the Court concludes that local political parties have a \xe2\x80\x9cclose relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with federal candidates, thus warranting greater congressional regulation, I am unaware of <em>any</em> evidence in the record that indicates that local political parties have <em>any</em> relationship with federal candidates.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0BCRA does not even close all of the \xe2\x80\x9cloopholes\xe2\x80\x9d that currently exist.

Significant portions of Titles I and II of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA or Act) constrain that freedom.  These new laws force speakers to abandon their own preference for speaking through parties and organizations.  And they provide safe harbor to the mainstream press, suggesting that the corporate media alone suffice to alleviate the burdens the Act places on the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding these laws purports simply to follow <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and to abide by <em>stare decisis</em>, see <em>ante</em>, at 27 (joint opinion of Stevens and O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, JJ. (hereinafter Court or majority)); but the majority, to make its decision work, must abridge free speech where <em>Buckley</em> did not.  <em>Buckley</em> did not authorize Congress to decide what shapes and forms the national political dialogue is to take.  To reach today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Court surpasses <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limits and expands Congress\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory power.  In so doing, it replaces discrete and respected First Amendment principles with new, amorphous, and unsound rules, rules which dismantle basic protections for speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A few examples show how BCRA reorders speech rights and codifies the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own preferences for certain speakers.  BCRA would have imposed felony punishment on Ross Perot\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 efforts to build the Reform Party.  Compare Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7309(d)(1)(A), 315(a)(1)(B), and 323(a)(1) (prohibiting, by up to five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, any individual from giving over $25,000 annually to a national party), with Spending By Perot, The Houston Chronicle, Dec. 13, 1996, p.\xc2\xa043 (reporting Perot\xe2\x80\x99s $8 million founding contribution to the Reform Party).  BCRA makes it a felony for an environmental group to broadcast an ad, within 60 days of an election, exhorting the public to protest a Congressman\xe2\x80\x99s impending vote to permit logging in national forests.  See BCRA \xc2\xa7203.  BCRA escalates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination in favor of the speech rights of giant media corporations and against the speech rights of other corporations, both profit and nonprofit.  Compare BCRA \xc2\xa7203, with <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, 659\xe2\x80\x93660 (1990) (first sanctioning this type of discrimination).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the majority, all this is not only valid under the First Amendment but also is part of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csteady improvement of the national election laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  We should make no mistake.  It is neither.  It is the codification of an assumption that the mainstream media alone can protect freedom of speech.  It is an effort by Congress to ensure that civic discourse takes place only through the modes of its choosing.  And BCRA is only the beginning, as its congressional proponents freely admit:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a modest step, it is a first step, it is an essential step, but it does not even begin to address, in some ways, the fundamental problems that exist with the hard money aspect of the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. S2101 (Mar. 20, 2002) (statement of Sen. Feingold).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>Id.,</em> at S2097 (statement of Sen.

The dangers posed by speech regulations have led the Court to insist upon principled constitutional lines and a rigorous standard of review.  The majority now abandons these distinctions and limitations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect, I dissent from the majority opinion upholding BCRA Titles I and II.  I concur in the judgment as to BCRA \xc2\xa7213 and new FECA \xc2\xa7323(e) and concur in the judgment in part and dissent in part as to BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201, 202, and 214.</p>\n<p align="left">I. TITLE I AND COORDINATION PROVISIONS</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I principally bans the solicitation, receipt, transfer and spending of soft money by the national parties (new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a), 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(a) (Supp. 2003)).  It also bans certain uses of soft money by state parties (new FECA \xc2\xa7323(b)); the transfer of soft money from national parties to nonprofit groups (new FECA \xc2\xa7323(d)); the solicitation, receipt, transfer, and spending of soft money by federal candidates and officeholders (new FECA \xc2\xa7323(e)); and certain uses of soft money by state candidates (new FECA \xc2\xa7323(f)).  These provisions, and the other provisions with which this opinion is principally concerned, are set out in full, see Appendix, <em>infra</em>.  Even a cursory review of the speech and association burdens these laws create makes their First Amendment infirmities obvious:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I bars individuals with shared beliefs from pooling their money above limits set by Congress to form a new third party.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I bars national party officials from soliciting or directing soft money to state parties for use on a state ballot initiative.  This is true even if no federal office appears on the same ballot as the state initiative.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A national party\xe2\x80\x99s mere involvement in the strategic planning of fundraising for a state ballot initiative risks a determination that the national party is exercising \xe2\x80\x9cindirect control\xe2\x80\x9d of the state party.  If that determination is made, the state party must abide by federal regulations.  And this is so even if the federal candidate on the ballot, if there is one, runs unopposed or is so certain of election that the only voter interest is in the state and local campaigns.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I compels speech.  Party officials who want to engage in activity such as fundraising must now speak magic words to ensure the solicitation cannot be interpreted as anything other than a solicitation for hard, not soft, money.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I prohibits the national parties from giving any sort of funds to nonprofit entities, even federally regulated hard money, and even if the party hoped to sponsor the interest group\xe2\x80\x99s exploration of a particular issue in advance of the party\xe2\x80\x99s addition of it to their platform.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By express terms, Title I imposes multiple different forms of spending caps on parties, candidates, and  their agents.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a), (e), and (f).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I allows state parties to raise quasi-soft money Levin funds for use in activities that might affect a federal election; but the Act prohibits national parties from assisting state parties in developing and executing these fundraising plans, even when the parties seek only to advance state election interests.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated cases, the Court has accepted but two principles to use in determining the validity of campaign finance restrictions.  First is the anticorruption rationale.  The principal concern, of course, is the agreement for a <em>quid pro quo</em> between officeholders (or candidates) and those who would seek to influence them.  The Court has said the interest in preventing corruption allows limitations on receipt of the <em>quid</em> by a candidate or officeholder, regardless of who gives it or of the intent of the donor or officeholder.  See <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 26\xe2\x80\x93\n27, 45\xe2\x80\x9348; <em>infra</em>, at \xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.  Second, the Court has analyzed laws that classify on the basis of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate or union identity under the corporate speech rationale.  The Court has said that the willing adoption of the entity form by corporations and unions justifies regulating them differently: Their ability to give candidates <em>quids</em> may be subject not only to limits but also to outright bans; their electoral speech may likewise be curtailed.  See <em>Austin,</em> 494 U. S., at 659\xe2\x80\x93660; <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Right to Work Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/197/index.html">459 U. S. 197</a>, 201\xe2\x80\x93211 (1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority today opens with rhetoric that suggests a conflation of the anticorruption rationale with the corporate speech rationale.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x936 (hearkening back to, among others, Elihu Root and his advocacy against the use of corporate funds in political campaigning).  The conflation appears designed to cast the speech regulated here as unseemly corporate speech.  The effort, however, is unwarranted, and not just because money is not <em>per se</em> the evil the majority thinks.  Most of the regulations at issue, notably all of the Title I soft money bans and the Title II coordination provisions, do not draw distinctions based on corporate or union status.  Referring to the corporate speech rationale as if it were the linchpin of the case, when corporate speech is not primarily at issue, adds no force to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Instead, the focus must be on <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption rationale and the First Amendment rights of individual citizens.</p>\n<p align="left">A.  Constitutionally Sufficient Interest</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Buckley,</em> the Court held that one, and only one, interest justified the significant burden on the right of association involved there: eliminating, or preventing, actual corruption or the appearance of corruption stemming from contributions to candidates.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unnecessary to look beyond the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary purpose\xe2\x80\x94to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions\xe2\x80\x94in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 26.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>ibid.</em> (concluding this corruption interest was sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d to sustain \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d interference with protected First Amendment rights).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In parallel, <em>Buckley</em> concluded the expenditure limitations in question were invalid because they did not advance that same interest.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he independent expenditure ceiling thus fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>id.,</em> at 45, 46.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, though <em>Buckley</em> subjected expenditure limits to strict scrutiny and contribution limits to less exacting review, it<em> </em>held neither could withstand constitutional challenge unless it was shown to advance the anticorruption interest.  In these consolidated cases, unless <em>Buckley</em> is to be repudiated, we must conclude that the regulations further that interest before considering whether they are closely drawn or narrowly tailored.  If the interest is not advanced, the regulations cannot comport with the Constitution, quite apart from the standard of review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buckley</em> made clear, by its express language and its context, that the corruption interest only justifies regulating candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of what we can call the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>quids</em>\xe2\x80\x9d in the <em>quid pro quo</em> formulation.  The Court rested its decision on the principle that campaign finance regulation that restricts speech without requiring proof of particular corrupt action withstands constitutional challenge only if it regulates conduct posing a demonstrable <em>quid pro quo</em> danger:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>id.,</em> at 45 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ssuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  That <em>Buckley</em> rested its decision on this <em>quid pro quo</em> standard is not a novel observation.  We have held this was the case:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe exception [of contribution limits being justified under the First Amendment] relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributions to a <em>candidate:</em> \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0To the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing</em> v. <em>Berkeley,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/290/index.html"></a><a href="/us/454/290/index.html">454 U.

S. ___ (2003) (furthering this anticorruption rationale\nby upholding limits on contributions given directly to candidates); <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a> (2000) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to rely on language from cases like <em>Shrink Missouri</em> to establish that the standard defining corruption is broader than conduct that presents a <em>quid pro quo</em> danger, see <em>ante</em>, at 43, n. 48, in those cases the Court in fact upheld limits on conduct possessing <em>quid pro quo</em> dangers, and nothing more.  See also <em>infra</em>, 12.  For example, the <em>Shrink Missouri</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing of what was at issue there and <em>quid pro quo</em>, in fact, shows only that it used the term <em>quid pro quo</em> to refer to actual corrupt, vote-buying exchanges, as opposed to interactions that possessed <em>quid pro quo</em> potential even if innocently undertaken.  Thus, the Court said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e spoke in Buckley of the perception of corruption \xe2\x80\x98inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions\xe2\x80\x99 to candidates for public office . . . as a source of concern \xe2\x80\x9calmost equal\xe2\x80\x9d to <em>quid pro quo</em> improbity.\xe2\x80\x9d  528 U. S., at 390 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, the perception of corruption that the majority now asserts is somehow different from the <em>quid pro quo</em> potential discussed in this opinion, was created by an exchange featuring <em>quid pro quo</em> potential\xe2\x80\x94contributions directly to a candidate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether conduct poses a <em>quid pro quo</em> danger the analysis is functional.  In <em>Buckley</em>, the Court confronted an expenditure limitation provision that capped the amount of money individuals could spend on any activity intended to influence a federal election (<em>i.e.</em>, it reached to both independent and coordinated expenditures).  See 424 U. S., at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  The Court concluded that though the limitation reached both coordinated and independent expenditures, there were other valid FECA provisions that barred coordinated expenditures.  Hence, the limit at issue only added regulation to independent expenditures.  On that basis it concluded the provision was unsupported by any valid corruption interest.  The conduct to which it added regulation (independent expenditures) posed no <em>quid pro quo</em> danger.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Placing <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption rationale in the context of the federal legislative power yields the following rule: Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interest in preventing corruption provides a basis for regulating federal candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of <em>quids</em>, whether or not the candidate or officeholder corruptly received them.  Conversely, the rule requires the Court to strike down campaign finance regulations when they do not add regulation to \xe2\x80\x9cactual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court ignores these constitutional bounds and in effect interprets the anticorruption rationale to allow regulation not just of \xe2\x80\x9cactual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> but of any conduct that wins goodwill from or influences a Member of Congress.  It is not that there is any quarrel between this opinion and the majority that the inquiry since <em>Buckley</em> has been whether certain conduct creates \xe2\x80\x9cundue influence.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  On that we agree.  The very aim of <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard, however, was to define undue influence by reference to the presence of <em>quid pro quo</em> involving the officeholder.  The Court, in contrast, concludes that access, without more, proves influence is undue.  Access, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, has the same legal ramifications as actual or apparent corruption of officeholders.  This new definition of corruption sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority says it is not abandoning our cases in this way, but its reasoning shows otherwise:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMore importantly, plaintiffs conceive of corruption too narrowly.  Our cases have firmly established that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate interest extends beyond preventing simple cash-for-votes corruption to curbing \xe2\x80\x98undue influence on an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, or the appearance of such influence.\xe2\x80\x99  [<em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U. S. 431</a>, 441 (2001) <em>(Colorado II)</em>].  Many of the \xe2\x80\x98deeply disturbing examples\xe2\x80\x99 of corruption cited by this Court in <em>Buckley</em> to justify FECA\xe2\x80\x99s contribution limits were not episodes of vote buying, but evidence that various corporate interests had given substantial donations to gain access to high-level government officials.  Even if that access did not secure actual influence, it certainly gave the \xe2\x80\x98appearance of such influence.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Colorado II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 441; see also [<em>Buckley </em>v.<em> Valeo,</em> 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 821, 838 (CADC 1975)].</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe record in the present case is replete with similar examples of national party committees peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders\nin exchange for large soft-money donations.  See [251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 492\xe2\x80\x93506 (DC 2003) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.)].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 40\xe2\x80\x9341.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority notes that access flowed from the regulated conduct at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and its progeny, then uses that fact as the basis for concluding that access peddling by the parties equals corruption by the candidates.  That conclusion, however, is tenable only by a quick and subtle shift, and one that breaks new ground: The majority ignores the <em>quid pro quo</em> nature of the regulated conduct central to our earlier decisions.  It relies instead solely on the fact that access flowed from the conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To ignore the fact that in <em>Buckley</em> the money at issue was given to candidates, creating an obvious <em>quid pro quo</em> danger as much as it led to the candidates also providing access to the donors, is to ignore the Court\xe2\x80\x99s comments in <em>Buckley</em> that show <em>quid pro quo</em> was of central importance to the analysis.  See 424 U. S., at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 45.  The majority also ignores that in <em>Buckley</em>, and ever since,<em> </em>those party contributions that have been subject to congressional limit were not general party-building contributions but were only contributions used to influence particular elections.  That is, they were contributions that flowed to a particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, again posing a <em>quid pro quo</em> danger.  And it ignores that in <em>Colorado II</em>, the party spending was that which was coordinated with a particular candidate, thereby implicating <em>quid pro quo</em> dangers.  In all of these ways the majority breaks the necessary tether between <em>quid</em> and access and assumes that access, all by itself, demonstrates corruption and so can support regulation.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 47 (\xe2\x80\x9c[L]arge soft-money donations to national party committees are likely to buy donors preferential access to federal officeholders no matter the ends to which their contributions are eventually put\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Access in itself, however, shows only that in a general sense an officeholder favors someone or that someone has influence on the officeholder.  There is no basis, in law or in fact, to say favoritism or influence in general is the same as corrupt favoritism or influence in particular.  By equating vague and generic claims of favoritism or influence with actual or apparent corruption, the Court adopts a definition of corruption that dismantles basic First Amendment rules, permits Congress to suppress speech in the absence of a <em>quid pro quo</em> threat, and moves beyond the rationale that is <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s very foundation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The generic favoritism or influence theory articulated by the Court is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.  Any given action might be favored by any given person, so by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning political loyalty of the purest sort can be prohibited.  There is no remaining principled method for inquiring whether a campaign finance regulation does in fact regulate corruption in a serious and meaningful way.  We are left to defer to a congressional conclusion that certain conduct creates favoritism or influence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the majority cites common sense as the foundation for its definition of corruption, see <em>ante,</em> at 35, 43, in the context of the real world only a single definition of corruption has been found to identify political corruption successfully and to distinguish good political responsiveness from bad\xe2\x80\x94that is <em>quid pro quo</em>.  Favoritism and influence are not, as the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory suggests, avoidable in representative politics.  It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies.  It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors.  Democracy is premised on responsiveness.  Q<em>uid pro quo</em> corruption has been, until now, the only agreed upon conduct that represents the bad form of responsiveness and presents a justiciable standard with a relatively clear limiting principle: Bad responsiveness may be demonstrated by pointing to a relationship between an official and a <em>quid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to mask its extension of <em>Buckley</em> under claims that BCRA prevents the appearance of corruption, even if it does not prevent actual corruption, since some assert that any donation of money to a political party is suspect.  See <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x9342.  Under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Congress has a valid \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 47\xe2\x80\x9348, however, the inquiry does not turn on whether some persons assert that an appearance of corruption exists.  Rather, the inquiry turns on whether the Legislature has established that the regulated conduct has inherent corruption potential, thus justifying the inference that regulating the conduct will stem the appearance of real corruption.  <em>Buckley</em> was guided and constrained by this analysis.  In striking down expenditure limits the Court in <em>Buckley</em> did not ask whether people thought large election expenditures corrupt, because clearly at that time many persons, including a majority of Congress and the President, did.  See <em>id.,</em> at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the parties and <em>amici</em>, the primary interest served . . . by the Act as a whole, is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, the Court asked whether the Government had proved that the regulated conduct, the expenditures, posed inherent <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption potential.  See <em>id.,</em> at 46.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Buckley</em> decision made this analysis even clearer in upholding contribution limitations.  It stated that even if actual corrupt contribution practices had not been proved, Congress had an interest in regulating the appearance of corruption that is \xe2\x80\x9cinherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 27 (discussing contributions to<em> </em>candidates).  See also <em>id.,</em> at 28, 30.  The <em>quid pro quo</em> nature of candidate contributions justified the conclusion that the contributions pose inherent corruption potential; and this in turn justified the conclusion that their regulation would stem the appearance of real corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From that it follows that the Court today should not ask, as it does, whether some persons, even Members of Congress, conclusorily assert that the regulated conduct appears corrupt to them.  Following <em>Buckley</em>, it should instead inquire whether the conduct now prohibited inherently poses a real or substantive <em>quid pro quo</em> danger, so that its regulation will stem the appearance of <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">1.

From there it would justify \xc2\xa7323\xe2\x80\x99s remaining provisions as necessary complements to ensure the national parties cannot circumvent \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions.  The broad brush approach fails, however, when the provisions are reviewed under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s proper definition of corruption potential.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face \xc2\xa7323(a) does not regulate federal candidates\xe2\x80\x99 or officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of <em>quids</em> because it does not regulate contributions to, or conduct by, candidates or officeholders.  See BCRA \xc2\xa7101(a) (setting out new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a): National parties may not \xe2\x80\x9csolicit, receive, or direct to another person \xe2\x80\xa6 or spend any [soft money]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The realities that underlie the statute, furthermore, do not support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  Before BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, parties could only use soft money for a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>e.g.</em>, through issue ads, which all parties now admit may influence elections) independent of that candidate.  And, as discussed later, \xc2\xa7323(e) validly prohibits federal candidate and officeholder solicitation of soft money party donations.  See <em>infra</em>, at 31.  Section 323(a), therefore, only adds regulation to soft money party donations not solicited by, or spent in coordination with, a candidate or officeholder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These donations (noncandidate or officeholder solicited soft money party donations that are independently spent) do not pose the <em>quid pro quo</em> dangers that provide the basis for restricting protected speech.  Though the government argues \xc2\xa7323(a) does regulate federal candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of <em>quids</em>, it bases its argument on this flawed reasoning:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1) \xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal elected officeholders are inextricably linked to their political parties,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Appellees/Cross Appellants FEC et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931674 et\xc2\xa0al., p.\xc2\xa021; cf. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/604/index.html">518 U.

Justice Thomas demonstrated that a general party-candidate corruption linkage does not exist.  As he pointed out:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe dearth of evidence [of such corruption] is unsurprising in light of the unique relationship between a political party and its candidates: \xe2\x80\x98The very aim of a political party is to influence its candidate\xe2\x80\x99s stance on issues and, if the candidate takes office or is reelected, his votes.\xe2\x80\x99  If coordinated expenditures help achieve this aim, the achievement \xe2\x80\x98does not \xe2\x80\xa6 constitute \xe2\x80\x9ca subversion of the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado II,\nsupra,</em> at 476\xe2\x80\x93477 (citations omitted)<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer</em> reached the same conclusion about the corrupting effect general party receipts could have on particular candidates, though on narrower grounds.

Still, no Member of Congress testified this favoritism changed voting behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The piece of record evidence the Government puts forward on this score comes by way of deposition testimony from former Senator Simon and Senator Feingold.  See<em> </em>251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 482 (DC 2003) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Senator Simon reported an unidentified colleague indicated frustration with Simon\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to legislation that would benefit a party contributor on the grounds that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay attention to who is buttering our bread\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and testified he did not think there was any question \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98this\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cdonors getting their way\xe2\x80\x9d) was why the legislation passed.  See App. 805.  Senator Feingold, too, testified an unidentified colleague suggested he support the legislation because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98they [<em>i.e.</em>, the donor] just gave us [<em>i.e.</em>, the party] $100,000.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 482 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That evidence in fact works against the Government.  These two testifying Senators expressed disgust toward the favoring of a soft money giver, and not the good will one would have expected under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  That necessarily undercuts the inference of corruption the Government would have us draw from the evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even more damaging to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument from the testimony is the absence of testimony that the Senator who allegedly succumbed to corrupt influence had himself solicited soft money from the donor in question.  Equally, there is no indication he simply favored the company with his vote because it had, without any involvement from him, given funds to the party to which he belonged.  This fact is crucial.  If the Senator himself had been the solicitor of the soft money funds in question, the incident does nothing more than confirm that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts at campaign finance reform ought to be directed to conduct that implicates <em>quid pro quo</em> relationships.  Only if there was some evidence that the officeholder had not solicited funds from the donor could the Court extrapolate from this episode that general party contributions function as <em>quids</em>, inspiring corrupt favoritism among party members.  The episode is the single one of its type reported in the record and does not seem sufficient basis for major incursions into settled practice.  Given the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the corrupt favoritism problem is widespread, its inability to produce more than a single instance purporting to illustrate the point demonstrates the Government has not fairly characterized the general attitudes of Members towards soft money donors from whom they have not solicited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other aspects of the record confirm the Government has not produced evidence that Members corruptly favor soft money donors to their party as a <em>per se</em> matter.  Most testimony from which the Government would have the Court infer corruption is testimony that Members are rewarded by their parties for soliciting soft money.  See i<em>d.,</em> at 438\xe2\x80\x93521 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  This says nothing about how Members feel about a party\xe2\x80\x99s soft money donors from whom they have not solicited.  Indeed, record evidence on this point again cuts against the Government:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98As a Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I experienced the pressure first hand.  On several occasions when we were debating important tax bills, I needed a police escort to get into the Finance Committee hearing room because so many lobbyists were crowding the halls, trying to get one last chance to make their pitch to each Senator.  Senators generally knew which lobbyist represented the interests of which large donor.  I was often glad that I limited the amount of soft money fundraising I did and did not take PAC contributions, because it would be extremely difficult not to feel beholden to these donors otherwise.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Id.,</em> at 482 (testimony of former Senator Boren; see 6\xe2\x80\x93R Defs. Exhs., Tab 8, \xc2\xb6  ;8).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, one of the handful of Senators on whom the Government relies to make its case candidly admits the pressure of appeasing soft money donors derives from the Members\xe2\x80\x99 solicitation of donors, not from those donors\xe2\x80\x99 otherwise giving to their party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of all this, \xc2\xa7323(a) has no valid anticorruption interest.  The anticircumvention interests the Government offers in defense of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(b), (d), and (f) must also fall with the interests asserted to justify \xc2\xa7323(a).  Any anticircumvention interest can be only as compelling as the interest justifying the underlying regulation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of these other sections has an independent justifying interest.  Section 323(b), for example, adds regulation only to activity undertaken by a state party.  In the District Court two of the three judges found as fact that particular state and local parties exist primarily to participate in state and local elections, that they spend the majority of their resources on those elections, and that their voter registration and Get Out The Vote (GOTV) activities, in particular, are directed primarily at state and local elections.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 301\xe2\x80\x93302 (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <em>id.,</em> at 837\xe2\x80\x93840 (Leon, J.).  These findings, taken together with BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s other, valid prohibitions barring coordination with federal candidates or officeholders and their soft money solicitation, demonstrate that \xc2\xa7323(b) does not add regulation to conduct that poses a danger of a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x99s or officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of <em>quids</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even \xc2\xa7323(b)\xe2\x80\x99s narrowest regulation, which bans state party soft money funded ads that (1) refer to a clearly identified federal candidate, and (2) either support or attack any candidate for the office of the clearly mentioned federal candidate, see new FECA \xc2\xa7301(20)(A)(iii), fails the constitutional test.  The ban on conduct that by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s own definition may serve the interest of a federal candidate suggests to the majority that it is conduct that poses <em>quid pro quo</em> danger for federal candidates or officeholders.  Yet, even this effect\xe2\x80\x94considered after excising the coordination and candidate-solicited funding aspects elsewhere prohibited by BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202 and 214(a) and new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a)\xe2\x80\x94poses no danger of a federal candidate\xe2\x80\x99s or officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of a <em>quid</em>.  That conduct is no different from an individual\xe2\x80\x99s independent expenditure referring to and supporting a clearly identified candidate\xe2\x80\x94and this poses no regulable danger.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 323(d), which governs relationships between the national parties and nonprofit groups, fails for similar reasons.  It is worth noting that neither the record nor our own experience tells us how significant these funds transfers are at this time.  It is plain, however, that the First Amendment ought not to be manipulated to permit Congress to forbid a political party from aiding other speakers whom the party deems more effective in addressing discrete issues.  One of the central flaws in BCRA is that Congress is determining what future course the creation of ideas and the expression of views must follow.  Its attempt to foreclose new and creative partnerships for speech, as illustrated here, is consistent with neither the traditions nor principles of our Free Speech guarantee, which insists that the people, and not the Congress, decide what modes of expression are the most legitimate and effective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s upholding \xc2\xa7323(d) is all the more unsettling because of the way it ignores the Act as Congress wrote it.  Congress said national parties \xe2\x80\x9cshall not solicit any funds for, or make or direct any donations to\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7501(c) nonprofit organizations that engage in federal election activity or to \xc2\xa7527 political committees.  The Court, however, reads out the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d and construes the words \xe2\x80\x9cfunds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdonations\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9csoft money funds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csoft money donations.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 72 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis construction is consistent with the concerns animating Title I, whose purpose is to plug the soft-money loophole\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory amendment may be consistent with its anti-soft-money rationale; it is not, however, consistent with the plain and unavoidable statutory text Congress has given us.  Even as construed by the Court, moreover, it is invalid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority strains to save the provision from what must seem to it an unduly harsh First Amendment.  It does so by making a legislative determination Congress chose not to make: to prefer hard money to soft money within the construct of national party relationships with nonprofit groups.  Congress gave no indication of a preference to regulate either hard money or soft in this context.  Rather, it simply proscribed all transfers of money between the two organizations and all efforts by the national parties to raise any money on the nonprofit groups\xe2\x80\x99 behalf.  The question the Court faces is not which part of a text to sever and strike, but whether Congress can prohibit such transfers altogether.  The answer, as the majority recognizes, is no.  See <em>ante</em>, at 71 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]rohibiting parties from donating funds already raised in compliance with FECA does little to further Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though \xc2\xa7323(f) in effect imposes limits on candidate contributions, it does not address federal candidate and officeholder contributions.  Yet it is the possibility of federal officeholder <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption potential that animates <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule as it relates to Acts of Congress (as opposed to Acts of state legislatures).  See 424 U. S., at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections is well established\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When one recognizes that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a), (b), (d), and (f) do not serve the interest the anticorruption rationale contemplates, Title I\xe2\x80\x99s entirety begins to look very much like an incumbency protection plan.  See J. Miller, Monopoly Politics 84\xe2\x80\x93101 (1999) (concluding that regulations limiting election fundraising and spending constrain challengers more than incumbents).  That impression is worsened by the fact that Congress exempted its officeholders from the more stringent prohibitions imposed on party officials.  Compare new FECA \xc2\xa7323(a) with new FECA \xc2\xa7323(e).  Section 323(a) raises an inflexible bar against soft money solicitation, in any way, by parties or party officials.  Section 323(e), in contrast, enacts exceptions to the rule for federal officeholders (the very centerpiece of possible corruption), and allows them to solicit soft money for various uses and organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law in some respects even weakens the regulation of federal candidates and officeholders.  Under former law, officeholders were understood to be limited to receipt of hard money by their campaign committees.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7431, 441a (setting out the pre-BCRA FECA regime).  BCRA, however, now allows them and their campaign committees to receive soft money that fits the hard money source and amount restrictions, so long as the officeholders direct that money on to other nonfederal candidates.  See new FECA \xc2\xa7323(e)(1)(B).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of this weakening of the regime as \xe2\x80\x9ctightly constrain[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d candidates, <em>ante,</em> at 73, n.\xc2\xa070, is a prime example of its unwillingness to confront Congress\xe2\x80\x99 own interest or the persisting fact that the regulations violate First Amendment freedoms.  The more lenient treatment accorded to incumbency-driven politicians than to party officials who represent broad national constituencies must render all the more suspect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s sole purpose is to stop corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority answers this charge by stating the obvious, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7323(e) applies to both officeholders <em>and candidates</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 78, n. 72.  The controlling point, of course, is the practical burden on challengers.  That the prohibition applies to both incumbents and challengers in no way establishes that it burdens them equally in that regard.  Name recognition and other advantages held by incumbents ensure that as a general rule incumbents will be advantaged by the legislation the Court today upholds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government identifies no valid anticorruption interest justifying \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a), (b), (d), and (f).  The very nature of the restrictions imposed by these provisions makes one all the more skeptical of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the interests at stake.  These provisions cannot stand under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">2.  New FECA \xc2\xa7323(e)</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, only one of the challenged Title I provisions satisfies <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption rationale and the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee.  It is \xc2\xa7323(e).  This provision is the sole aspect of Title I that is a direct and necessary regulation of federal candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of <em>quids</em>.  Section 323(e) governs \xe2\x80\x9ccandidate[s], individual[s] holding Federal office, agent[s] of a candidate or an individual holding Federal office, or an entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by or acting on behalf of 1 or more candidates or individuals holding Federal office.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(e) (Supp. 2003).  These provisions, and the regulations that follow, limit candidates\xe2\x80\x99 and their agents\xe2\x80\x99 solicitation of soft money.  The regulation of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of funds furthers a constitutionally sufficient interest.  More difficult, however, is the question whether regulation of a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s solicitation of funds also furthers this interest if the funds are given to another.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that the broader solicitation regulation does further a sufficient interest.  The making of a solicited gift is a <em>quid</em> both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment (by granting his request).  Rules governing candidates\xe2\x80\x99 or officeholders\xe2\x80\x99 solicitation of contributions are, therefore, regulations governing their receipt of <em>quids</em>.  This regulation fits under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption rationale.</p>\n<p align="left">B.  Standard of Review</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is common ground between the majority and this opinion that a speech-suppressing campaign finance regulation, even if supported by a sufficient Government interest, is unlawful if it cannot satisfy our designated standard of review.  See <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9327.  In <em>Buckley</em>, we applied \xe2\x80\x9cclosely drawn\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny to contribution limitations and strict scrutiny to expenditure limitations.  Compare 424 U. S., at 25, with <em>id.,</em> at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Against that backdrop, the majority assumes that because <em>Buckley</em> applied the rationale in the context of contribution and expenditure limits, its application gives Congress and the Court the capacity to classify any challenged campaign finance regulation as either a contribution or an expenditure limit.  Thus, it first concludes Title I\xe2\x80\x99s regulations are contributions limits and then proceeds to apply the lesser scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cComplex as its provisions may be, \xc2\xa7323, in the main, does little more than regulate the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 28.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis denies it, Title I\xe2\x80\x99s dynamics defy this facile, initial classification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title I\xe2\x80\x99s provisions prohibit the receipt of funds; and in most instances, but not all, this can be defined as a contribution limit.  They prohibit the spending of funds; and in most instances this can be defined as an expenditure limit.  They prohibit the giving of funds to nonprofit groups; and this falls within neither definition as we have ever defined it.  Finally, they prohibit fundraising activity; and the parties dispute the classification of this regulation (the challengers say it is core political association, while the Government says it ultimately results only in a limit on contribution receipts).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s classification overlooks these competing characteristics and exchanges <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s substance for a formulaic caricature of it.  Despite the parties\xe2\x80\x99 and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts on both sides of the question, it ignores reality to force these regulations into one of the two legal categories as either contribution or expenditure limitations.  Instead, these characteristics seem to indicate Congress has enacted regulations that are neither contribution nor expenditure limits, or are perhaps both at once.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the laws could be classified in broad terms as only contribution limits, as the majority is inclined to do, that still leaves the question what \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution limits\xe2\x80\x9d can include if they are to be upheld under <em>Buckley</em>.  <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application of a less exacting review to contribution limits must be confined to the narrow category of money gifts that are directed, in some manner, to a candidate or officeholder.  Any broader definition of the category contradicts <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s <em>quid pro quo</em> rationale and overlooks <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language, which contemplates limits on contributions to a candidate or campaign committee in explicit terms.  See<em> </em>424 U. S., at 13 (applying less exacting review to \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution \xe2\x80\xa6 limitations in the Act prohibit[ing] individuals from contributing more than $25,000 in a single year or more than $1,000 to any single candidate for an election campaign\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 45 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he contribution limitations\xe2\x80\x99 [apply a] total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>id.,</em> at 20, 25, 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, it must be acknowledged, both in <em>Buckley</em> and on other occasions, has described contribution limits due some more deferential review in less than precise terms.  At times it implied that donations to political parties would also qualify as contributions whose limitation too would be subject to less exacting review.  See <em>id.,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, n.\xc2\xa024 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he general understanding of what constitutes a political contribution[:] Funds provided to a candidate or political party or campaign committee either directly or indirectly through an intermediary constitute a contribution\xe2\x80\x9d).

In a similar, but more imperative, sense proper application of the standard of review to regulations that are neither contribution nor expenditure limits (or which are both at once) can only be determined by reference to that rationale.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s underlying rationale is this: Less exacting review applies to Government regulations that \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly interfere\xe2\x80\x9d with First Amendment rights of association.  But any regulation of speech or associational rights creating \xe2\x80\x9cmarkedly greater interference\xe2\x80\x9d than such significant interference receives strict scrutiny.  Unworkable and ill advised though it may be, <em>Buckley</em> unavoidably sets forth this test:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cEven a \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csignificant interference\xe2\x80\x9d with protected rights of political association\xe2\x80\x99 may be sustained if the State demonstrates [1] a sufficiently important interest and [2] employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.  <em>Cousins</em> v. <em>Wigoda</em>, [<a href="/cases/federal/us/419/477/index.html">419 U.

Because these cases are of such extraordinary importance, I cannot avoid adding to the many writings a few words of my own.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a sad day for the freedom of speech.  Who could have imagined that the same Court which, within the past four years, has sternly disapproved of restrictions upon such inconsequential forms of expression as virtual child pornography, <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/234/index.html">535 U. S. 234</a> (2002), tobacco advertising, <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co.</em> v. <em>Reilly, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/525/index.html">533 U. S. 525</a> (2001), dissemination of illegally intercepted communications, <em>Bartnicki</em> v. <em>Vopper, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/514/index.html">532 U. S. 514</a> (2001), and sexually explicit cable programming, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a> (2000), would smile with favor upon a law that cuts to the heart of what the First Amendment is meant to protect: the right to criticize the government.  For that is what the most offensive provisions of this legislation are all about.  We are governed by Congress, and this legislation prohibits the criticism of Members of Congress by those entities most capable of giving such criticism loud voice: national political parties and corporations, both of the commercial and the not-for-profit sort.  It forbids pre-election criticism of incumbents by corporations, even not-for-profit corporations, by use of their general funds; and forbids national-party use of \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d money to fund \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads\xe2\x80\x9d that incumbents find so offensive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the legislation is evenhanded: It similarly prohibits criticism of the candidates who oppose Members of Congress in their reelection bids.  But as everyone knows, this is an area in which evenhandedness is not fairness.  If <em>all </em>electioneering were evenhandedly prohibited, incumbents would have an enormous advantage.  Likewise, if incumbents and challengers are limited to the same quantity of electioneering, incumbents are favored.  In other words, <em>any</em> restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond that, however, the present legislation <em>targets</em> for prohibition certain categories of campaign speech that are particularly harmful to incumbents.  Is it accidental, do you think, that incumbents raise about three times as much \xe2\x80\x9chard money\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the sort of funding generally <em>not</em> restricted by this legislation\xe2\x80\x94as do their challengers?  See FEC, 1999\xe2\x80\x932000 Financial Activity of All Senate\nand House Campaigns (Jan. 1, 1999\xe2\x80\x93Dec. 31, 2000) (last modified on May 15, 2001), http://www.fec.gov/press/ 051501congfinact/tables/allcong2000.xls (all Internet ma-terials as visited Dec. 4, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Or that lobbyists (who seek the favor of incumbents) give 92 percent of their money in \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d contributions?  See U. S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), The Lobbyist\xe2\x80\x99s Last Laugh: How K Street Lob-\nbyists Would Benefit from the McCain-Feingold Cam-\npaign Finance Bill 3 (July 5, 2001), http://www.pirg.org/\ndemocracy/democracy.asp?id2=5068.  Is it an oversight, do you suppose, that the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaire provisions\xe2\x80\x9d raise the contribution limit for a candidate running against an individual who devotes to the campaign (as challengers often do) great personal wealth, but do not raise the limit for a candidate running against an individual who devotes to the campaign (as incumbents often do) a massive election \xe2\x80\x9cwar chest\xe2\x80\x9d?  See BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7304, 316, and 319.  And is it mere happenstance, do you estimate, that national-party funding, which is severely limited by the Act, is more likely to assist cash-strapped challengers than flush-with-hard-money incumbents?  See A. Gierzynski &amp; D.\xc2\xa0Breaux, The Financing Role of Parties, in Campaign Finance in State Legislative Elections 195\xe2\x80\x93200 (J. Thompson &amp; S.\xc2\xa0Moncrief eds. 1998).  Was it unintended, by any chance, that incumbents are free personally to receive some soft money and even to solicit it for other organizations, while national parties are not?  See new FECA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7323(a) and (e).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I wish to address three fallacious propositions that might be thought to justify some or all of the provisions of this legislation\xe2\x80\x94only the last of which is explicitly embraced by the principal opinion for the Court, but all of which underlie, I think, its approach to these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">(a)\xc2\xa0 Money is Not Speech</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was said by congressional proponents of this legislation, see 143 Cong. Rec. 20746 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Boxer), 145 Cong. Rec. S12612 (Oct. 14, 1999) (remarks of Sen. Cleland), 147 Cong. Rec. S2436 (Mar. 19, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Dodd), with support from the law reviews, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Wright, Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech?, 85 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1001 (1976), that since this legislation regulates nothing but the expenditure of money for speech, as opposed to speech itself, the burden it imposes is not subject to full First Amendment scrutiny; the government may regulate the raising and spending of campaign funds just as it regulates other forms of conduct, such as burning draft cards, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U. S. 367</a> (1968), or camping out on the National Mall, see <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Community for Creative Non&amp;nbhyph;Violence,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/288/index.html">468 U. S. 288</a> (1984).  That proposition has been endorsed by one of the two authors of today\xe2\x80\x99s principal opinion: \xe2\x80\x9cThe right to use one\xe2\x80\x99s own money to hire gladiators, [and] to fund \xe2\x80\x98speech by proxy,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 [are] property rights . . . not entitled to the same protection as the right to say what one pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 399 (2000) (Stevens, J., concurring).  Until today, however, that view has been categorically rejected by our jurisprudence.  As we said in<em> Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 16, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our traditional view was correct, and today\xe2\x80\x99s cavalier attitude toward regulating the financing of speech (the \xe2\x80\x9cexacting scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d test of <em>Buckley</em>, see <em>ibid.</em>, is not uttered in any majority opinion, and is not observed in the ones from which I dissent) frustrates the fundamental purpose of the First Amendment.  In any economy operated on even the most rudimentary principles of division of labor, effective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others.  An author may write a novel, but he will seldom publish and distribute it himself.  A freelance reporter may write a story, but he will rarely edit, print, and deliver it to subscribers.  To a government bent on suppressing speech, this mode of organization presents opportunities: Control any cog in the machine, and you can halt the whole apparatus.  License printers, and it matters little whether authors are still free to write.  Restrict the sale of books, and it matters little who prints them.  Predictably, repressive regimes have exploited these principles by attacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, Printing Act of 1662, 14 Car. II, c. 33, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 4, 7 (punishing printers, importers, and booksellers); Printing Act of 1649, 2 Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum 245, 246, 250 (punishing authors, printers, booksellers, importers, and buyers).  In response to this threat, we have interpreted the First Amendment broadly.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <em>Bantam Books, Inc.</em> v. <em>Sullivan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/58/index.html">372 U. S. 58</a>, 65, n.\xc2\xa06 (1963) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press embraces the circulation of books as well as their publication\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Division of labor requires a means of mediating exchange, and in a commercial society, that means is supplied by money.  The publisher pays the author for the right to sell his book; it pays its staff who print and assemble the book; it demands payments from booksellers who bring the book to market.  This, too, presents opportunities for repression: Instead of regulating the various parties to the enterprise individually, the government can suppress their ability to coordinate by regulating their use of money.  What good is the right to print books without a right to buy works from authors?  Or the right to publish newspapers without the right to pay deliverymen?  The right to speak would be largely ineffective if it did not include the right to engage in financial transactions that are the incidents of its exercise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that <em>any </em>regulation of money is a regulation of speech.  The government may apply general commercial regulations to those who use money for speech if it applies them evenhandedly to those who use money for other purposes.  But where the government singles out money used to fund speech as its legislative object, it is acting against speech as such, no less than if it had targeted the paper on which a book was printed or the trucks that deliver it to the bookstore.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0History and jurisprudence bear this out.  The best early examples derive from the British efforts to tax the press after the lapse of licensing statutes by which the press was first regulated.  The Stamp Act of 1712 imposed levies on all newspapers, including an additional tax for each advertisement.  10 Anne, c. 18, \xc2\xa7113.  It was a response to unfavorable war coverage, \xe2\x80\x9cobvious[ly] \xe2\x80\xa6 designed to check the publication of those newspapers and pamphlets which depended for their sale on their cheapness and sensationalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  F.\xc2\xa0Siebert, Freedom of the Press in England, 1476\xe2\x80\x931776, pp.\xc2\xa0309\xe2\x80\x93310 (1952).  It succeeded in killing off approximately half the newspapers in England in its first year.  <em>Id.</em>, at 312.  In 1765, Parliament applied a similar Act to the Colonies.  5 Geo. III, c. 12, \xc2\xa71.  The colonial Act likewise placed exactions on sales and advertising revenue, the latter at 2s. per advertisement, which was \xe2\x80\x9cby any standard . . . excessive, since the publisher himself received only from 3 to 5s. and still less for repeated insertions.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Schlesinger, Prelude to Independence:  The Newspaper War on Britain, 1764\xe2\x80\x931776, p.\xc2\xa068 (1958).  The founding generation saw these taxes as grievous incursions on the freedom of the press.  See,<em> e.g.</em>, 1 D.\xc2\xa0Ramsay, History of the American Revolution 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (L. Cohen ed. 1990); J.\xc2\xa0Adams, A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1765), reprinted in 3 Life and Works of John Adams 445, 464 (C.\xc2\xa0Adams ed. 1851).  See generally <em>Grosjean</em> v. <em>American Press Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/233/index.html">297 U. S. 233</a>, 245\xe2\x80\x93249 (1936); Schlesinger, <em>supra,</em> at 67\xe2\x80\x9384.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have kept faith with the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 tradition by prohibiting the selective taxation of the press.  <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co.</em> v. <em>Minnesota Comm\xe2\x80\x99r of Revenue,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/575/index.html">460 U. S. 575</a> (1983) (ink and paper tax); <em>Grosjean</em>, <em>supra</em> (advertisement tax).  And we have done so whether the tax was the product of illicit motive or not.  See <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co., supra</em>, at 592.  These press-taxation cases belie the claim that regulation of money used to fund speech is not regulation of speech itself.  A tax on a newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s advertising revenue does not prohibit anyone from saying anything; it merely appropriates part of the revenue that a speaker would otherwise obtain.  That is even a step short of totally prohibiting advertising revenue\xe2\x80\x94\nwhich would be analogous to the total prohibition of certain campaign-speech contributions in the present\ncases.  Yet it is unquestionably a violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many other cases exemplify the same principle that an attack upon the funding of speech is an attack upon speech itself.  In <em>Schaumburg</em> v. <em>Citizens for a Better Environment,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/620/index.html">444 U. S. 620</a> (1980), we struck down an ordinance limiting the amount charities could pay their solicitors.  In<em> Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</em> v. <em>Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/105/index.html">502 U. S. 105</a> (1991), we held unconstitutional a state statute that appropriated the proceeds of criminals\xe2\x80\x99 biographies for payment to the victims.  And in <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a> (1995), we held unconstitutional a university\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination in the disbursement of funds to speakers on the basis of viewpoint.  Most notable, perhaps, is our famous opinion in <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a> (1964), holding that paid advertisements in a newspaper were entitled to full First Amendment protection:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAny other conclusion would discourage newspapers from carrying \xe2\x80\x98editorial advertisements\xe2\x80\x99 of this type, and so might shut off an important outlet for the promulgation of information and ideas by persons who do not themselves have access to publishing facilities\xe2\x80\x94who wish to exercise their freedom of speech even though they are not members of the press.  The effect would be to shackle the First Amendment in its attempt to secure \xe2\x80\x98the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 266 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis passage was relied on in <em>Buckley</em> for the point that restrictions on the expenditure of money for speech are equivalent to restrictions on speech itself.  424 U. S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  That reliance was appropriate.  If denying protection to paid-for speech would \xe2\x80\x9cshackle the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d so also does forbidding or limiting the right to pay for speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should be obvious, then, that a law limiting the amount a person can spend to broadcast his political views is a direct restriction on speech.  That is no different from a law limiting the amount a newspaper can pay its editorial staff or the amount a charity can pay its leafletters.  It is equally clear that a limit on the amount a candidate can <em>raise</em> from any one individual for the purpose of speaking is also a direct limitation on speech.  That is no different from a law limiting the amount a publisher can accept from any one shareholder or lender, or the amount a newspaper can charge any one advertiser or customer.</p>\n<p align="left">(b)\xc2\xa0 Pooling Money is Not Speech</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another proposition which could explain at least some of the results of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is that the First Amendment right to spend money for speech does not include the right to combine with others in spending money for speech.  Such a proposition fits uncomfortably with the concluding words of our Declaration of Independence: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the support of this Declaration, . . . we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, <em>our Fortunes</em> and our sacred Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The freedom to associate with others for the dissemination of ideas\xe2\x80\x94not just by singing or speaking in unison, but by pooling financial resources for expressive purposes\xe2\x80\x94is part of the freedom of speech.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cOur form of government is built on the premise that every citizen shall have the right to engage in political expression and association. This right was enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights.  Exercise of these basic freedoms in America has traditionally been through the media of political associations.  Any interference with the freedom of a party is simultaneously an interference with the freedom of its adherents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U. S. 415</a>, 431 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression.  The constitutional right of association explicated in <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/index.html">357 U. S. 449</a>, 460 (1958), stemmed from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x98[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.\xe2\x80\x99  Subsequent decisions have made clear that the First and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfreedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe have said that \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9ca corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roberts </em>v.<em> United States Jaycees,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/609/index.html">468 U. S. 609</a>, 622 (1984).  That \xe2\x80\x9cright to associate . . . in pursuit\xe2\x80\x9d includes the right to pool financial resources.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If it were otherwise, Congress would be empowered to enact legislation requiring newspapers to be sole proprietorships, banning their use of partnership or corporate form.  That sort of restriction would be an obvious violation of the First Amendment, and it is incomprehensible why the conclusion should change when what is at issue is the pooling of funds for the most important (and most perennially threatened) category of speech: electoral speech.  The principle that such financial association does not enjoy full First Amendment protection threatens the existence of all political parties.</p>\n<p align="left">(c)  Speech by Corporations Can Be Abridged </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The last proposition that might explain at least some of today\xe2\x80\x99s casual abridgment of free-speech rights is this: that the particular form of association known as a corporation does not enjoy full First Amendment protection.  Of course the text of the First Amendment does not limit its application in this fashion, even though \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Cooke, Corporation, Trust and Company 92 (1951).  Nor is there any basis in reason why First Amendment rights should not attach to corporate associations\xe2\x80\x94and we have said so.  In <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978), we held unconstitutional a state prohibition of corporate speech designed to influence the vote on referendum proposals.  We said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.  If the speakers here were not corporations, no one would suggest that the State could silence their proposed speech.  It is the type of speech indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.  The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 776\xe2\x80\x93777 (internal quotation marks, footnotes, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, supra</em>, at 428\xe2\x80\x93429, 431, we held that the NAACP could assert First Amendment rights \xe2\x80\x9con its own behalf, . . . though a corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the activities of the corporation were \xe2\x80\x9cmodes of expression and association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/1/index.html">475 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (1986), we held unconstitutional a state effort to compel corporate speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe identity of the speaker,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9cis not decisive in determining whether speech is protected.  Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the \xe2\x80\x98discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas\xe2\x80\x99 that the First Amendment seeks to foster.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in <em>Buckley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, we held unconstitutional FECA\xe2\x80\x99s limitation upon independent corporate expenditures.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court changed course in <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 494<em> </em>U. S. 652 (1990), upholding a state prohibition of an independent corporate expenditure in support of a candidate for state office.  I dissented in that case, see <em>id</em>., at 679, and remain of the view that it was error.  In the modern world, giving the government power to exclude corporations from the political debate enables it effectively to muffle the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy and the most passionately held social and political views.  People who associate\xe2\x80\x94who pool their financial resources\xe2\x80\x94for purposes of economic enterprise overwhelmingly do so in the corporate form; and with increasing frequency, incorporation is chosen by those who associate to defend and promote particular ideas\xe2\x80\x94such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association, parties to these cases.  Imagine, then, a government that wished to suppress nuclear power\xe2\x80\x94or oil and gas exploration, or automobile manufacturing, or gun ownership, or civil liberties\xe2\x80\x94and that had the power to prohibit corporate advertising against its proposals.  To be sure, the individuals involved in, or benefited by, those industries, or interested in those causes, could (given enough time) form political action committees or other associations to make their case.  But the organizational form in which those enterprises already <em>exist</em>, and in which they can most quickly and most effectively get their message across, is the corporate form.  The First Amendment does not in my view permit the restriction of that political speech.  And the same holds true for corporate electoral speech: A candidate should not be insulated from the most effective speech that the major participants in the economy and major incorporated interest groups can generate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what about the danger to the political system posed by \xe2\x80\x9camassed wealth\xe2\x80\x9d?  The most direct threat from that source comes in the form of undisclosed favors and payoffs to elected officials\xe2\x80\x94which have already been criminalized, and will be rendered no more discoverable by the legislation at issue here.  The use of corporate wealth (like individual wealth) to speak to the electorate is unlikely to \xe2\x80\x9cdistort\xe2\x80\x9d elections\xe2\x80\x94<em>especially</em> if disclosure requirements <em>tell</em> the people where the speech is coming from.  The premise of the First Amendment is that the American people are neither sheep nor fools, and hence fully capable of considering both the substance of the speech presented to them and its proximate and ultimate source.  If that premise is wrong, our democracy has a much greater problem to overcome than merely the influence of amassed wealth.  Given the premises of democracy, there is no such thing as <em>too much</em> speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, it is argued, quite apart from its effect upon the electorate, corporate speech in the form of contributions to the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, or even in the form of independent expenditures supporting the candidate, engenders an obligation which is later paid in the form of greater access to the officeholder, or indeed in the form of votes on particular bills.  Any <em>quid-pro-quo</em> agreement for votes would of course violate criminal law, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201, and actual payoff <em>votes</em> have not even been claimed by those favoring the restrictions on corporate speech.  It cannot be denied, however, that corporate (like noncorporate) allies will have greater access to the officeholder, and that he will tend to favor the same causes as those who support him (which is usually <em>why</em> they supported him).  That is the nature of politics\xe2\x80\x94if not indeed human nature\xe2\x80\x94and how this can properly be considered \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cthe appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d) with regard to corporate allies and not with regard to other allies is beyond me.  If the Bill of Rights had intended an exception to the freedom of speech in order to combat this malign proclivity of the officeholder to agree with those who agree with him, and to speak more with his supporters than his opponents, it would surely have said so.  It did not do so, I think, because the juice is not worth the squeeze.  Evil corporate (and private affluent) influences are well enough checked (so long as adequate campaign-expenditure disclosure rules exist) by the politician\xe2\x80\x99s fear of being portrayed as \xe2\x80\x9cin the pocket\xe2\x80\x9d of so-called moneyed interests.  The incremental benefit obtained by muzzling corporate speech is more than offset by loss of the information and persuasion that corporate speech can contain.  That, at least, is the assumption of a constitutional guarantee which prescribes that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But let us not be deceived.  While the Government\xe2\x80\x99s briefs and arguments before this Court focused on the horrible \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d the most passionate floor statements during the debates on this legislation pertained to so-called attack ads, which the Constitution surely protects, but which Members of Congress analogized to \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine,\xe2\x80\x9d 144 Cong. Rec. S868 (Feb. 24, 1998) (remarks of Sen. Daschle), \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-by shooting[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at S879 (remarks of Sen. Durbin), and \xe2\x80\x9cair pollution,\xe2\x80\x9d 143 Cong. Rec. 20505 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Dorgan).  There is good reason to believe that the ending of negative campaign ads was the principal attraction of the legislation.  A Senate sponsor said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that we will not allow our attention to be distracted from the real issues at hand\xe2\x80\x94how to raise the tenor of the debate in our elections and give people real choices.  No one benefits from negative ads.  They don\xe2\x80\x99t aid our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s political dialog.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 20521\xe2\x80\x9320522 (remarks of Sen. McCain).  He assured the body that \xe2\x80\x9c[y]ou cut off the soft money, you are going to see a lot less of that [attack ads].  Prohibit unions and corporations, and you will see a lot less of that.  If you demand full disclosure for those who pay for those ads, you are going to see a lot less of that . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  147 Cong. Rec. S3116 (Mar. 29, 2001) (remarks of Sen. McCain).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, 148 Cong. Rec. S2117 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Cantwell) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis bill is about slowing the ad war. . . . It is about slowing political advertising and making sure the flow of negative ads by outside interest groups does not continue to permeate the airwaves\xe2\x80\x9d); 143 Cong. Rec. 20746 (1997) (remarks of Sen. Boxer) (\xe2\x80\x9cThese so-called issues ads are not regulated at all and mention candidates by name. They directly attack candidates without any accountability.  It is brutal\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  We have an opportunity in the McCain-Feingold bill to stop that . . .\xe2\x80\x9d); 145 Cong. Rec. S12606\xe2\x80\x93S12607 (Oct. 14, 1999) (remarks of Sen. Wellstone) (\xe2\x80\x9cI think these issue advocacy ads are a nightmare.  I think all of us should hate them\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [By passing the legislation], [w]e could get some of this poison politics off television\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another theme prominent in the legislative debates was the notion that there is too much money spent on elections.  The first principle of \xe2\x80\x9creform\xe2\x80\x9d was that \xe2\x80\x9cthere should be less money in politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  147 Cong. Rec. S3236 (Apr. 2, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Murray).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe enormous amounts of special interest money that flood our political system have become a cancer in our democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. S2151 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy).  \xe2\x80\x9c[L]arge sums of money drown out the voice of the average voter.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. H373 (Feb. 13, 2002) (remarks of Rep. Langevin).  The system of campaign finance is \xe2\x80\x9cdrowning in money.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at H404 (remarks of Rep. Menendez).  And most expansively:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDespite the ever-increasing sums spent on campaigns, we have not seen an improvement in campaign discourse, issue discussion or voter education.  More money does not mean more ideas, more substance or more depth.  Instead, it means more of what voters complain about most.  More 30-second spots, more negativity and an increasingly longer campaign period.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. S2150 (Mar. 20, 2002) (remarks of Sen. Kerry).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPerhaps voters do detest these 30-second spots\xe2\x80\x94though I suspect they detest even more hour-long campaign-debate interruptions of their favorite entertainment programming.  Evidently, however, these ads <em>do persuade </em>voters, or else they would not be so routinely used by sophisticated politicians of all parties.  The point, in any event, is that it is not the proper role of those who govern us to judge which campaign speech has \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d (do you think it might be that which is least damaging to incumbents?) and to abridge the rest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what exactly are these outrageous sums frittered away in determining who will govern us?  A report prepared for Congress concluded that the total amount, in hard and soft money, spent on the 2000 federal elections was between $2.4 and $2.5 billion.  J. Cantor, CRS Report for Congress, Campaign Finance in the 2000 Federal Elections: Overview and Estimates of the Flow of Money (2001).  <em>All</em> campaign spending in the United States, including state elections, ballot initiatives, and judicial elections, has been estimated at $3.9 billion for 2000, Nelson, Spending in the 2000 Elections, in Financing the 2000 Election 24, Tbl. 2\xe2\x80\x931 (D. Magleby ed. 2002), which was a year that \xe2\x80\x9cshattered spending and contribution records,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 22.  Even taking this last, larger figure as the benchmark, it means that Americans spent about half as much electing all their Nation\xe2\x80\x99s officials, state and federal, as they spent on movie tickets ($7.8 billion); about a fifth as much as they spent on cosmetics and perfume ($18.8 billion); and about a sixth as much as they spent\non pork (the nongovernmental sort) ($22.8 billion).  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Tbl. 2.6U (Col. AS; Rows 356, 214, and 139), http:// www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/206u.csv.  If our democracy is drowning from this much spending, it cannot swim.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Which brings me back to where I began: This litigation is about preventing criticism of the government.  I cannot say for certain that many, or some, or even any, of the Members of Congress who voted for this legislation did so not to produce \xe2\x80\x9cfairer\xe2\x80\x9d campaigns, but to mute criticism of their records and facilitate reelection.  Indeed, I will stipulate that all those who voted for the Act believed they were acting for the good of the country.  There remains the problem of the Charlie Wilson Phenomenon, named after Charles Wilson, former president of General Motors, who is supposed to have said during the Senate hearing on his nomination as Secretary of Defense that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s good for General Motors is good for the country.\xe2\x80\x9d*<footcall num="*">  Those in power, even giving them the benefit of the greatest good will, are inclined to believe that what is good for them is good for the country.  Whether in prescient recognition of the Charlie Wilson Phenomenon, or out of fear of good old-fashioned, malicious, self-interested manipulation, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fundamental approach of the First Amendment . . . was to assume the worst, and to rule the regulation of political speech \xe2\x80\x98for fairness\xe2\x80\x99 sake\xe2\x80\x99 simply out of bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 693 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Having abandoned that approach to a limited extent in <em>Buckley</em>, we abandon it much further today.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We will unquestionably be called upon to abandon it further still in the future.  The most frightening passage in the lengthy floor debates on this legislation is the following assurance given by one of the cosponsoring Senators to his colleagues:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a modest step, it is a first step, it is an essential step, but it does not even begin to address, in some ways, the fundamental problems that exist with the hard money aspect of the system.\xe2\x80\x9d  148 Cong. Rec. S2101 (Mar. 20, 2002) (statement of Sen. Feingold).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe system indeed.  The first instinct of power is the retention of power, and, under a Constitution that requires periodic elections, that is best achieved by the suppression of election-time speech.  We have witnessed merely the second scene of Act I of what promises to be a lengthy tragedy.  In scene 3 the Court, having abandoned most of the First Amendment weaponry that <em>Buckley</em> left intact, will be even less equipped to resist the incumbents\xe2\x80\x99 writing of the rules of political debate.  The federal election campaign laws, which are already (as today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions show) so voluminous, so detailed, so complex, that no ordinary citizen dare run for office, or even contribute a significant sum, without hiring an expert advisor in the field, can be expected to grow more voluminous, more detailed, and more complex in the years to come\xe2\x80\x94and always, always, with the objective of reducing the excessive amount of speech.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0It is disillusioning to learn that the fabled quote is inaccurate.

Admittedly, exploitation of an anticircumvention concept has a long pedigree, going back at least to <em>Buckley</em> itself.  <em>Buckley</em> upheld a $1,000 contribution ceiling as a way to combat both the \xe2\x80\x9cactuality and appearance of corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 26.  The challengers in <em>Buckley</em> contended both that bribery laws represented \xe2\x80\x9ca less restrictive means of dealing with \xe2\x80\x98proven and suspected <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 27, and that the $1,000 contribution ceiling was overbroad as \xe2\x80\x9cmost large contributors do not seek improper influence over a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s position or an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 29.  The Court rejected the first argument on the grounds that \xe2\x80\x9claws making criminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 27\xe2\x80\x9328, and rejected the second on the grounds that \xe2\x80\x9cit [is] difficult to isolate suspect contributions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 30.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But a broadly drawn bribery law[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] would cover even subtle and general attempts to influence government officials corruptly, eliminating the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first concern.  And, an effective bribery law would deter actual <em>quid pro quos</em> and would, in all likelihood, eliminate any appearance of corruption in the system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, at root, the <em>Buckley</em> Court was concerned that bribery laws could not be effectively enforced to prevent <em>quid pro quos</em> between donors and officeholders, and the only rational reading of <em>Buckley</em> is that it approved the $1,000 contribution ceiling on this ground.  The Court then, however, having at least in part concluded that individual contribution ceilings were necessary to prevent easy evasion of bribery laws, proceeded to uphold a separate contribution limitation, using, as the only justification, the \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[ion] [of] evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 38.  The need to prevent circumvention of a limitation that was itself an anticircumvention measure led to the upholding of another significant restriction on individuals\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The joint opinion now repeats this process.  New Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) \xc2\xa7323(a), 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7441i(a) (Supp. 2003), is intended to prevent easy circumvention of the (now) $2,000 contribution ceiling.  The joint opinion even recognizes this, relying heavily on evidence that, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9ccandidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing intermediaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36.  The joint opinion upholds \xc2\xa7323(a), in part, on the grounds that it had become too easy to circumvent the $2,000 cap by using the national parties as go-betweens.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the remaining provisions of new FECA \xc2\xa7323 are upheld mostly as measures preventing circumvention of other contribution limits, including \xc2\xa7323(a), <em>ante, </em>at 55\xe2\x80\x9357 (\xc2\xa7323(b)); <em>ante, </em>at 66\xe2\x80\x9369 (\xc2\xa7323(d)); <em>ante, </em>at 75 (\xc2\xa7323(e)); <em>ante, </em>at 77\xe2\x80\x9378 (\xc2\xa7323(f)), which, as I have already explained, is a second-order anticircumvention measure.  The joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s handling of \xc2\xa7323(f) is perhaps most telling, as it upholds \xc2\xa7323(f) only because of \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 eminently reasonable <em>prediction</em> that \xe2\x80\xa6 state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding of sham issue advertising.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 78 (emphasis added).  That is, this Court upholds a third-order anticircumvention measure based on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 anticipation of circumvention of these second-order anticircumvention measures that might possibly, at some point in the future, pose some problem.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not difficult to see where this leads.  Every law has limits, and there will always be behavior not covered by the law but at its edges; behavior easily characterized as \xe2\x80\x9ccircumventing\xe2\x80\x9d the law\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.  Hence, speech regulation will again expand to cover new forms of \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvention,\xe2\x80\x9d only to spur supposed circumvention of the new regulations, and so forth.  Rather than permit this never-ending and self-justifying process, I would require that the Government explain why proposed speech restrictions are needed in light of actual Government interests, and, in particular, why the bribery laws are not sufficient.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Title I falls even on the joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  This Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 391.  And three Members of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority have observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe opportunity for corruption\xe2\x80\x9d presented by \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nregulated \xe2\x80\x98soft money\xe2\x80\x99 contributions\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cat best, attenuated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado I</em>, 518 U. S., at 616 (opinion of Breyer, J., joined by O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and Souter, JJ.).  Such an observation is quite clearly correct.  A donation to a political party is a clumsy method by which to influence a candidate, as the party is free to spend the donation however it sees fit, and could easily spend the money as to provide no help to the candidate.  And, a soft-money donation to a party will be of even less benefit to a candidate, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of legal restrictions on how the money may be spent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for FEC et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931674 et\xc2\xa0al., p.\xc2\xa043.  It follows that the defendants bear an especially heavy empirical burden in justifying Title I.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence cited by the joint opinion does not meet this standard and would barely suffice for anything more than rational-basis review.  The first category of the joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s evidence is evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal officeholders have commonly asked donors to make soft-money donations to national and state committees solely in order to assist federal campaigns, including the officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But to the extent that donors and federal officeholders have collaborated so that donors could give donations to a national party committee \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\xe2\x80\x9d the alleged soft-money donation is in actuality a regular \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d as already defined and regulated by FECA.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431(8)(A)(i).  Neither the joint opinion nor the defendants present evidence that enforcement of pre-BCRA law has proved to be impossible, ineffective, or even particularly difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second category is evidence that \xe2\x80\x9clobbyists, CEOs, and wealthy individuals\xe2\x80\x9d have \xe2\x80\x9cdonat[ed] substantial sums of soft money to national committees not on ideological grounds, but for the express purpose of securing influence over federal officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 37.  Even if true (and the cited evidence consists of nothing more than vague allegations of wrongdoing), it is unclear why existing bribery laws could not address this problem.  Again, neither the joint opinion nor the defendants point to evidence that the enforcement of bribery laws has been or would be ineffective.  If the problem has been clear and widespread, as the joint opinion suggests, I would expect that convictions, or at least prosecutions, would be more frequent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third category is evidence characterized by the joint opinion as \xe2\x80\x9cconnect[ing] soft money to manipulations of the legislative calendar, leading to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enact, among other things, generic drug legislation, tort reform, and tobacco legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 40.  But the evidence for this is no stronger than the evidence that there has been actual vote buying or vote switching for soft money.  The joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s citations to the record do not stand for the propositions that they claim.  For instance, the McCain declaration does not provide any evidence of any exchange of legislative action for donations of any kind (hard or soft).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Neither do the Simpson or Simon declarations, with perhaps one exception effectively addressed by Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See <em>post</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  In fact, the findings by two of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judges confirm that the evidence of any <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption is exceedingly weak, if not nonexistent.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 349\xe2\x80\x93352 (DC 2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <em>id</em>., at 851\xe2\x80\x93853 (Leon, J.).  The evidence cited by the joint opinion is properly described as \xe2\x80\x9cat best, [the Members of Congress\xe2\x80\x99] personal conjecture regarding the impact of soft money donations on the voting practices of their present and former colleagues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 852 (Leon, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The joint opinion also places a substantial amount of weight on the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cin 1996 and 2000, more than half of the top 50 soft-money donors gave substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,\xe2\x80\x9d and suggests that this fact \xe2\x80\x9cleav[es] room for no other conclusion but that these donors were seeking influence, or avoiding retaliation, rather than promoting any particular ideology.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 38 (emphasis in original).  But that is not necessarily the case.  The two major parties are not perfect ideological opposites, and supporters or opponents of certain policies or ideas might find substantial overlap between the two parties.  If donors feel that both major parties are in general agreement over an issue of importance to them, it is unremarkable that such donors show support for both parties.  This commonsense explanation surely belies the joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s too-hasty conclusion drawn from a relatively innocent fact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court today finds such sparse evidence sufficient.  This cannot be held to satisfy even the \xe2\x80\x9crelatively complaisant review\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14), unless, as it appears, the Court intends to abdicate entirely its role.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is not content with \xe2\x80\x9cbalanc[ing] away First Amendment freedoms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shrink Missouri, </em>528 U. S., at 410 (Thomas, J., dissenting), in the context of the restrictions imposed by Title I, which could arguably (if wrongly) be thought to be mere contribution limits.  The Court also, in upholding virtually all of Title II, proceeds to do the same for limitations on expenditures, which constitute \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical expression \xe2\x80\x98at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley,</em> 424 U. S., at 39 (quoting<em> Williams</em> v. <em>Rhodes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/23/index.html">393 U. S. 23</a>, 32 (1968)).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding continues a disturbing trend: the steady decrease in the level of scrutiny applied to restrictions on core political speech.  See<em> Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 16 (First Amendment requires \xe2\x80\x9cexacting scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 387 (applying \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standard of scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Beaumont, supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (referencing \xe2\x80\x9crelatively complaisant review\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Although this trend is most obvious in the review of contribution limits, it has now reached what even this Court today would presumably recognize as a direct restriction on core political speech: limitations on independent expenditures.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, by accepting Congress\xe2\x80\x99 expansion of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of treating expenditures as limitations, the Court can pretend that it is, in fact, still only restricting primarily \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  I need not say much about this illusion.  I have already discussed how the language used in new FECA \xc2\xa7315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is, even under <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s framework, overly broad and restricts fully protected speech.  See<em> Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/431/index.html">533 U.

In <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, 659\xe2\x80\x93660 (1990), the Court recognized a \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent type of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98financial <em>quid pro quo\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d</em>: the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  The only effect, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9cimmense aggregations\xe2\x80\x9d of wealth will have (in the context of independent expenditures) on an election is that they might be used to fund communications to convince voters to select certain candidates over others.  In other words, the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrosive and distorting effects\xe2\x80\x9d described in <em>Austin</em> are that corporations, on behalf of their shareholders, will be able to convince voters of the correctness of their ideas.  Apparently, winning in the marketplace of ideas is no longer a sign that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate good\xe2\x80\x9d has been \xe2\x80\x9creached by free trade in ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d or that the speaker has survived \xe2\x80\x9cthe best test of truth\xe2\x80\x9d by having \xe2\x80\x9cthe thought \xe2\x80\xa6 get itself accepted in the competition of the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Abrams</em>, 250 U.

But we have already held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 348.  Of course, <em>Buckley</em> upheld the disclosure requirement on expenditures for communications using words of express advocacy based on this informational interest.  424 U. S., at 81.  And admittedly, <em>McIntyre</em> purported to distinguish <em>Buckley</em>.  <em>McIntyre</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 355\xe2\x80\x93356.  But the two ways <em>McIntyre</em> distinguished <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x94one, that the disclosure of \xe2\x80\x9can expenditure and its use, without more, reveals far less information [than a forced identification of the author of a pamphlet,]\xe2\x80\x9d 514 U.

The first is simply wrong.  The revelation of one\xe2\x80\x99s political expenditures for independent communications about candidates can be just as revealing as the revelation of one\xe2\x80\x99s name on a pamphlet for a noncandidate election.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 384 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The second was outright rejected in <em>Buckley</em> itself, where the Court concluded that independent expenditures did not create any substantial risk of real or apparent corruption.  424 U.

Hence, the only reading of <em>McIntyre</em> that remains consistent with the principles it contains is that it overturned <em>Buckley</em> to the extent that <em>Buckley</em> upheld a disclosure requirement solely based on the governmental interest in providing information to the voters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to anonymous speech cannot be abridged based on the interests asserted by the defendants.  I would thus hold that the disclosure requirements of BCRA \xc2\xa7201 are unconstitutional.

The Court noted that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of so indefinite a phrase as \xe2\x80\x98relative to\xe2\x80\x99 a candidate fails to clearly mark the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hence, the Court read the phrase to mean \xe2\x80\x9cadvocating the election or defeat of a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this construction did not complete the vagueness inquiry.  As the Court observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.  Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions.  Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThe Court then recognized that the constitutional issues raised by the provision \xe2\x80\x9ccan be avoided only by reading \xc2\xa7608(e)(1) as limited to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id</em>., at 43.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The joint opinion argues that <em>Buckley </em>adopted this narrow reading only to avoid addressing a constitutional question.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he concept of express advocacy and the concomitant class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional infirmities,\xe2\x80\x9d concludes the joint opinion after examining the language of <em>Buckley</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 85.  This ignores the fact that the Court then struck<em> </em>down the expenditure limitation precisely<em> </em>because it was too narrow:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitation\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.  Yet no substantial societal interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision designed to check corruption that permitted unscrupulous persons and organizations to expend unlimited sums of money in order to obtain improper influence over candidates for elective office.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 45.</p>\n<p align="left">\nFar from saving the provision from constitutional doubt, the Court read the provision in such a way as to guarantee its unconstitutionality.  If there were some possibility that regulation of communications without words of express advocacy were constitutional, the provision would have to have been read to include these communications, and the constitutional question addressed head on.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Indeed, the exceedingly narrow reading of the relevant language in <em>Buckley</em> is far from mandated by the text; it is, in fact, a highly strained reading.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A]ny expenditure \xe2\x80\xa6 relative to a clearly identified candidate,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 41, would be better read to cover, for instance, any expenditure for an advertisement aired close to an election that is \xe2\x80\x9cintended to influence the voters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions and ha[s] that effect,\xe2\x80\x9d a standard apparently endorsed by the joint opinion as being sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to express advocacy to justify its regulation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  By deliberately adopting a strained and narrow reading of the statutory text and then striking down the provision in question for being too narrow, the Court made clear that regulation of nonexpress advocacy was strictly forbidden.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is confirmed by other portions of <em>Buckley</em> and by other cases.  For instance, in limiting FECA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure provisions to expenditures involving express advocacy, the Court noted that it gave such a narrowing interpretation \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o insure that the reach of [the disclosure provision] is not <em>impermissibly broad</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 80 (emphasis added).  If overbreadth were a concern in limiting the scope of a disclosure provision, it surely was equally a concern in the limitation of an actual cap on expenditures.  And, in <em>MCFL</em>, the Court arguably eliminated any ambiguity remaining in <em>Buckley</em> when it explicitly stated that the narrowing interpretations taken in <em>Buckley</em> were necessary \xe2\x80\x9cin order to avoid problems of overbreadth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 248.  The joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to explain away <em>MCFL</em>\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable language is unpersuasive.  The joint opinion emphasizes that the <em>MCFL</em> Court \xe2\x80\x9cheld that a \xe2\x80\x98similar <em>construction</em>\xe2\x80\x99 must apply to the expenditure limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d as if that somehow proved its point.  <em>Ante</em>, at 85, n.\xc2\xa076 (emphasis in original).  The fact that the <em>MCFL</em> Court said this does not establish anything, of course; adopting a narrow construction of a statute \xe2\x80\x9cin order to avoid problems of overbreadth,\xe2\x80\x9d 479 U. S., at 248, is perfectly consistent with a holding that, lacking the narrowing construction, the statute would be overly broad, <em>i.e.</em>, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendants\xe2\x80\x99 principal argument in response is that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cit would be bizarre to conclude that the Constitution permits Congress to prohibit the use of corporate or union general treasury funds for electioneering advertisements, but that the <em>only</em> standard that it can constitutionally use (express advocacy) is one that misses the vast majority (88.6 percent) of advertisements that candidates themselves use for electioneering.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for FEC et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 02\xe2\x80\x931674 et\xc2\xa0al., p.\xc2\xa0103 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe joint opinion echoes this, stating that the express advocacy line \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be squared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 86.  First, the presence of the \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d <em>does</em> differentiate in a meaningful way between categories of speech.  Speech containing the \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously campaign related,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 81, while speech without these words is not.  Second, it is far from bizarre to suggest that (potentially regulable) speech that is in practice impossible to differentiate from fully protected speech must be fully protected.  It is, rather, part and parcel of First Amendment first principles.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U. S., at 255 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.  Protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter.  The Constitution requires the reverse\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, First Amendment protection was extended to that fundamental category of artistic and entertaining speech not for its own sake, but only because it was indistinguishable, practically, from speech intended to inform.  See<em> Joseph Burstyn, Inc.</em> v. <em>Wilson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/495/index.html">343 U. S. 495</a>, 501 (1952); <em>Winters</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/507/index.html">333 U. S. 507</a>, 510 (1948) (rejecting suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional protection for a free press applies only to the exposition of ideas\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cline between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat is one man\xe2\x80\x99s amusement, teaches another\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d).  This principle clearly played a significant role in <em>Buckley</em> itself, see<em> </em>424 U. S., at 42 (after noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application,\xe2\x80\x9d holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d standard must be adopted as the interpretation of the relevant language in FECA).  The express-advocacy line was drawn to ensure the protection of the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion of issues and candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d not out of some strange obsession of the Court to create meaningless lines.  And the joint opinion misses the point when it notes that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s express advocacy line, in short, has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 86\xe2\x80\x9387.  <em>Buckley</em> did not draw this line solely to aid in combating real or apparent corruption, but rather also to ensure the protection of speech unrelated to election campaigns.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is this to say that speech with words of express advocacy is somehow less protected, as the joint opinion claims.  <em>Ante, </em>at 99.  The Court in <em>Buckley</em> recognized an informational interest that justified the imposition of a disclosure requirement on campaign-related speech.  See 424 U. S., at 81.  This interest is not implicated with regard to speech that is unrelated to an election campaign.  Hence, it would be unconstitutional to impose such a disclosure requirement on non-election-related speech.  And, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates \xe2\x80\xa6 may often dissolve in practical application,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 42, the only way to prevent the unjustified burdening of nonelection speech is to impose the regulation only on speech that is \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously campaign related,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 81, <em>i.e.</em>, speech using words of express advocacy.  Hence, speech that uses words of express advocacy is protected under the same standard, strict scrutiny, as all other forms of speech.  The only difference is that, under <em>Buckley</em>, there is a governmental interest supporting some regulation of those using words of express advocacy not present in other forms of speech.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The chilling endpoint of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press.  None of the rationales offered by the defendants, and none of the reasoning employed by the Court, exempts the press.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so because of the difficulty, and perhaps impossibility, of distinguishing, either as a matter of fact or constitutional law, media corporations from [nonmedia] corporations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti,</em> 435 U. S., at 796 (Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring).  Media companies can run procandidate editorials as easily as nonmedia corporations can pay for advertisements.  Candidates can be just as grateful to media companies as they can be to corporations and unions.  In terms of \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects\xe2\x80\x9d of wealth accumulated by corporations that has \xe2\x80\x9clittle or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660, there is no distinction between a media corporation and a nonmedia corporation.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Media corporations are influential.  There is little doubt that the editorials and commentary they run can affect elections.  Nor is there any doubt that media companies often wish to influence elections.  One would think that the New York Times fervently hopes that its endorsement of Presidential candidates will actually influence people.  What is to stop a future Congress from determining that the press is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo influential,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d is significant when media organizations endorse candidates or run \xe2\x80\x9cslanted\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbiased\xe2\x80\x9d news stories in favor of candidates or parties?  Or, even easier, what is to stop a future Congress from concluding that the availability of unregulated media corporations creates a loophole that allows for easy \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvention\xe2\x80\x9d of the limitations of the current campaign finance laws?[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, I believe that longstanding and heretofore unchallenged opinions such as <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/index.html"></a><a href="/us/418/241/index.html">418 U. S. 241</a> (1974), are in peril.  There, the Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]hains of newspapers, national newspapers, national wire and news services, and one-newspaper towns, are the dominant features of a press that has become noncompetitive and enormously powerful and influential in its capacity to manipulate popular opinion and change the course of events.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 249.  Despite expressing some sympathy for those arguing for a legally created \xe2\x80\x9cright of access\xe2\x80\x9d to encourage diversity in viewpoints in the media, the Court struck down such laws, noting that these laws acted both to suppress speech and to \xe2\x80\x9cintru[de] into the function of editors\xe2\x80\x9d by interfering with \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of editorial control and judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 257\xe2\x80\x93258.  Now, supporters of such laws need only argue that the press\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity to manipulate popular opinion\xe2\x80\x9d gives rise to an \xe2\x80\x9cappearance of corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d especially when this capacity is used to promote a particular candidate or party.  After drumming up some evidence,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] laws regulating media outlets in their issuance of editorials would be upheld under the joint opinion\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning (a result considered so beyond the pale in <em>Miami Herald Publishing</em> that the Court there used it as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> against the right-of-access law being addressed, see <em>id</em>., at 256).  Nor is there anything in the joint opinion that would prevent Congress from imposing the Fairness Doctrine, not just on radio and television broadcasters, but on the entire media.  See <em>Red Lion Broadcasting</em>, 395 U. S., at 369 (defining the \xe2\x80\x9cfairness doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that discussion of public issues be presented \xe2\x80\xa6 and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of the press,\xe2\x80\x9d described as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the greatest bulwarks of liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 J.
