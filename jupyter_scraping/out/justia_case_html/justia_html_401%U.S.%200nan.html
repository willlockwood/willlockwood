S. 201</a></p><p></p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>The appellee, Stein, published a bi-weekly newspaper, the Dallas Notes.  Stein was charged with two violations of Art. 527, \xc2\xa7 1, of the Texas Penal Code, which then prohibited, among other things, the possession of obscene materials. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/200/case.html">*</a></span>  While these two cases were pending </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 401 U. S. 202</a></p><p> in state courts, Stein brought the present action in a federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1983, 1985, representing himself and a class consisting of present and future employees of and contributors to his newspaper.  The defendants were the district attorney of Dallas County, and the Dallas chief of police.  He sought:</p>\n<p>"[P]ermanent injunctive relief against the Dallas Police Department, requiring that . . . there be no arrest of plaintiff, nor seizure of his property on grounds of obscenity without a prior judicial determination of the obscene character of the material in question; . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  That the Court adjudge, decree and declare the rights of the parties with respect to the application of Article 527 of the Texas Penal Code;"</p>\n<p>". . .  That the Court grant such other and further relief as is just and equitable."</p>\n<p>A three-judge court was convened.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2284.  That court refused to require a hearing on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 401 U. S. 203</a></p><p> obscene character of the material before its seizure and the arrest of the plaintiff.  It held that the request for such relief was "based on the alleged harassment and . . . not an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute."  The court went on to emphasize that its consideration did</p>\n<p>"not in any way involve an appraisal of the constitutionality of the application of Article 527 to Plaintiff.  Our sole concern is the determination of whether the statute is constitutionally defective on its face."</p>\n<p>The three-judge court then turned to the statute itself, and held that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 were unconstitutional, and that \xc2\xa7 3 would be constitutional only if the definition of obscenity were changed somewhat.  The court issued appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief effectuating its conclusions.  300 F.Supp. 602 (1969).  Texas officials appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  396 U.S. 954 (1969).</p>\n<p>Today we have again stressed the rule that federal intervention affecting pending state criminal prosecutions, either by injunction or by declaratory judgment, is proper only where irreparable injury is threatened.  <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/157/case.html">319 U. S. 157</a></span> (1943).  The existence of such injury is a matter to be determined carefully under the facts of each case.  In this case, the District Court made no findings of any irreparable injury as defined by our decisions today; therefore, the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Younger v. Harris, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>, and <em>Samuels v.

JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>My Brother DOUGLAS\' dissenting opinion describes graphically the police conduct upon which appellee rested his allegations of bad faith and harassment.  If proved, these allegations would justify federal intervention.  The mass seizure of some two tons of the issues of the newspaper without a prior judicial determination of the alleged obscenity of the issues was unconstitutional.  <em>Marcus v. Search Warrant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/717/case.html">367 U. S. 717</a></span> (1961); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v.

Similarly, the mass seizure of the tools and equipment required to prepare the newspaper -- insofar as it disabled appellee from publishing future issues -- infringed the principle of <em>Near v.

The three-judge court below remanded to a single judge for determination all questions advanced by appellee except the contention that the Texas statute was unconstitutional on its face, and the appellee does not challenge this order of remand here.  I, therefore, would reverse the judgment of the District Court, except for paragraph 4, for the reasons stated in my separate opinion in <em>Perez v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The two raids in this case were search-and-destroy missions in the Vietnamese sense of the phrase.  In each case, the police came at night.  The first search warrant authorized a search and seizure of "obscene articles and materials, to-wit:  pictures, photographs, drawings and obscene literature" concealed at a given </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 401 U. S. 205</a></p><p> address.  The seizures included:  two tons of a newspaper (Dallas Notes), one photograph enlarger, two portable typewriters, two electric typewriters, one camera, "numerous obscene photographs," and $5.43 in money. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The second warrant was issued 16 days later, in response to a claim that marihuana was concealed on the premises.  It authorized the officers "to search for and seize the said narcotic drug and dangerous drug in accordance with the law in such cases provided."  Not finding any marihuana on the premises; the sergeant asked instructions from his lieutenant.  He was told to seize pornographic literature and any equipment used to make it.  He "didn\'t know what to seize and what not to seize so [he] just took everything."  "Everything" included a Polaroid camera, a Kodak Brownie, a Flocon camera, a Kodak lamp, a floating fixture lamp, a three-drawer desk containing printers\' supplies, a drafting square, a drafting table, two drawing boards, a mailing tube, two telephones, a stapler, five cardboard boxes containing documents, one electric typewriter, and one typewriter desk.  A poster of Mao Tse-tung, credit cards, costume jewelry, cans of spices, a brown sweater, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 401 U. S. 206</a></p><p> a statue of a man and woman in an embrace were also seized.  Thus, the newspaper Dallas Notes, a bi-monthly, was effectively put out of business. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>It would be difficult to find in our books a more lawless search-and-destroy raid, unless it be the one in <em>Kremen v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/346/case.html">353 U. S. 346</a></span>.  If this search-and-destroy technique can be employed against this Dallas newspaper, then it can be done to the New York Times, the Washington Post the Seattle Post Intelligencer, the Yakima Herald-Republic, the Sacramento Bee, and all the rest of our newspapers.  For, as I shall point out, the Texas statute governing "obscenity" [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] is plainly unconstitutional. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 401 U. S. 207</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Government certainly has no power to close down newspapers.  Even censorship -- whether for obscenity, for irresponsible reporting or editorials, or otherwise -- is taboo.  As Chief Justice Hughes said in <em>Near v. Minnesota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/case.html">283 U. S. 697</a></span>, decided in 1931:</p>\n<p>"[T]he administration of government has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and corruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by unfaithful officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and official neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities.  The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official misconduct.  Subsequent punishment for such abuses as may exist is the appropriate remedy, consistent with constitutional privilege."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/case.html#719">283 U. S. 719</a></span>-720.</p>\n<p>I agree with that view.</p>\n<p>It is said, however, that these issues are not before us, as the case has been remanded to a single judge to pass on them.  But we deal with plain error, as the state statute is unconstitutional on its face and we should put an end to lawless raids under it. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 401 U. S. 208</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The constitutional mandate that government [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] "shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press" precludes, in my view, any form of censorship.  Vicious, irresponsible, and depraved as the press often is, the constitutional remedy is not censorship. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The antidote is education, pinning our faith to the Jeffersonian creed that, by education, we may, in time, become a mature people. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 401 U. S. 209</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I have set forth my views over and over again as to why the First Amendment should be strictly construed, and they need not be repeated here.  It is difficult -- indeed, impossible -- to read the constitutional mandate that government "shall make no law" abridging freedom of the press to mean that government "may make some laws" abridging that freedom.  Certainly a strict constructionist cannot so read it.</p>\n<p>"The Court says it has been trying to balance the interests of society in protecting itself from the supposed evils of obscene material with the real interest in freedom of expression.  There is ample evidence that the clear and definite language of the first amendment was intended to preclude the very problem of balancing assumed by the Court.  The first amendment holds that the interest of society in freedom of expression [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] is more important than the harm that might flow from obscene material.  The very interest in protection from injury from obscene material would be better served by allowing each individual to make a free appraisal of pornographic material.  A hallmark of an immature and insecure society is the censorship of ideas.  Censorship, which insulates all from what some suppose to be evil, merely magnifies that insecurity.  If society does such a poor job of educating itself so that four letter words and explicit pictures are dangerous, the remedy is to improve the educational process, not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 401 U. S. 210</a></p><p> to outlaw certain publications.  While the first amendment does not mandate better education, it does prohibit the censorship of ideas.  This use of a balancing test evidences a misconception of the constitutional nature of society.  There is nothing to balance.  Society\'s security flows directly and solely from the freedom and security of each individual."</p>\n<p>31 Albany L.Rev. 143, 151 (1967).</p>\n<p>If I am correct in concluding that a State can make "no law" censoring the press because of obscenity, then a publisher threatened by such a law can go into a federal court to enjoin state officials from enforcing the law, as I made clear in my dissent in <em>Younger v. Harris, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#59">401 U. S. 59</a></span>.  The special circumstances where such federal intervention is permissible are not restricted to bad faith on the part of state officials or the threat of multiple prosecutions.  As Mr. Justice Butler, writing for the Court, said in <em>Terrace v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/197/case.html">263 U. S. 197</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/197/case.html#214">263 U. S. 214</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"Equity jurisdiction will be exercised to enjoin the threatened enforcement of a state law which contravenes the Federal Constitution wherever it is essential in order effectually to protect property rights and the rights of persons against injuries otherwise irremediable; and, in such a case, a person who, as an officer of the State, is clothed with the duty of enforcing its laws, and who threatens and is about to commence proceedings, either civil or criminal, to enforce such a law against parties affected, may be enjoined from such action by a federal court of equity."</p>\n<p><em>And see Watson v. Buck,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html">313 U. S. 387</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html#402">313 U. S. 402</a></span>.</p>\n<p>No possible construction of this state law can save it.  This is not a situation where mere overbreadth of a state statute may have chilling or crippling effects on First Amendment rights.  This is a case where Texas has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 401 U. S. 211</a></p><p> entered a field which the Constitution bars all the States and the Federal Government from entering.</p>\n<p>The Texas obscenity statute, as I view it, meets precisely the hypothetical statute we discussed in <em>Watson v. Buck,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html">313 U. S. 387</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/387/case.html#402">313 U. S. 402</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"It is, of course, conceivable that a statute might be flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it."</p>\n<p>No clearer case justifying federal intervention to prevent a state criminal trial can be imagined.</p>\n<p>No pending prosecutions are sought to be enjoined, only future ones. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Such an injunction is not impermissible under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2283.  <em>See Dombrowski v. Pfister,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html">380 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/479/case.html#484">380 U. S. 484</a></span> n. 2, and my dissent in <em>Younger v. Harris, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#65">401 U. S. 65</a></span>.  Appellee also asked for declaratory relief.  If <em>Zwickler v. Koota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/241/case.html">389 U. S. 241</a></span>, means anything, it means that such relief can also be granted.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>If a publication deemed "obscene" is not under the umbrella of the First Amendment, then I do not see how it enjoys many constitutional safeguards.  That which is out from under the First Amendment would normally be subject to the police power of the States.  Yet the Constitution contains no standards or suggestions of standards respecting the vast array of subjects that various vocal groups would like to have suppressed -- obscenity, sacrilege, un-Americanism, anti-clerical ideas, atheistic or anti-ecclesiastical ideas, Communism, racism, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="212">Page 401 U. S. 212</a></p><p> and so on.  Under the Constitution as written, there are no standards of "good" or "bad" for the press.  Since there is no constitutional definition of obscenity, the definition must be largely, if not exclusively, for legislative determination.  Absent a controlling constitutional standard, I would think that a legislature could treat literature as it treats sewage effluent or infectious disease.  That is not a happy prospect, for some would put even the Song of Solomon under the ban.  It is, I fear, where we end once we lose our First Amendment moorings.  Administrative censorship, however, is one thing.  Criminal punishment is quite another.  Publishing "obscene" literature cannot, as I view it, be made a crime under our constitutional standards.</p>\n<p>"Whatever \'obscenity\' is, it is immeasurable as a crime and delineable only as a sin.  As a sin, it is present only in the minds of some, and not in the minds of others.  It is entirely too subjective for legal sanction.  There are as many different definitions of obscenity as there are men, and they are as unique to the individual as are his dreams."</p>\n<p>Note, The Substantive Law of Obscenity:  An Adventure in Quicksand, 13 N.Y.L.F. 81, 131 (1967).  What appeals to "prurient interests" describes sin to some, but not to others, and seems to me to be far too vague to pass muster as a criminal, as distinguished from              an administrative, statute. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="213">Page 401 U. S. 213</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I see no help on the vagueness problem even if the test "utterly without redeeming social importance" were added to the criminal standard, as it was in <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/184/case.html">378 U. S. 184</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/184/case.html#191">378 U. S. 191</a></span>. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  That is a measurement which again is wholly subjective.  It cannot be related to anything but the judge\'s or jurors\' sophistication or stage of cultural development.  Nor do I think the problem is helped by introducing the concept of "contemporary community standards," whether that refers to the public at large or a local county or town standard.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/184/case.html#193">378 U. S. 193</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The two tests -- this Court\'s and that of Texas -- seem to me to be substantially identical.  I do not see how either can be held to be constitutional.  The standard of guilt is wholly subjective.  The jurors can convict or acquit according to their own personal tastes, their cultural standard, their literacy, and their tolerance for opposed ideas.  And the same would be true of judges.  It means that a book that is hailed as wholesome in one county may be the cause of punishment in another county of the same State.</p>\n<p>The evidence in obscenity prosecutions is usually expert testimony.  Analysts, English literature scholars, and others often have helpful and informed views, one way or the other.  It seems impossible, if we continue to sanction the use of these vague standards in criminal prosecutions, that verdicts will be rendered which are based on the record, and not on the emotional factors reflecting the prejudices of the judge or jurors.</p>\n<p>Uncertainty, rather than certainty, is the standard.
