FISHER<br/>\n540 U. S. ____ (2004)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ILLINOIS <em>v.</em> GREGORY FISHER</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the appellate\ncourt of illinois, first district</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93374. Decided February 23, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Appellate Court of Illinois held here that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause required the dismissal of criminal charges because the police, acting in good faith and according to normal police procedures, destroyed evidence that respondent had requested more than 10 years earlier in a discovery motion.  Petitioner, the State of Illinois, contends that such a result is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Youngblood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/51/index.html">488 U. S. 51</a> (1988).  There we held that \xe2\x80\x9cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 58.  We agree with petitioner, grant the petition for certiorari, and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 1988, Chicago police arrested respondent in the course of a traffic stop during which police observed him furtively attempting to conceal a plastic bag containing a white powdery substance.  Four tests conducted by the Chicago Police Crime Lab and the Illinois State Police Crime Lab confirmed that the bag seized from respondent contained cocaine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was charged with possession of cocaine in the Circuit Court of Cook County in October 1988.  He filed a motion for discovery eight days later requesting all physical evidence the State intended to use at trial.  The State responded that all evidence would be made available at a reasonable time and date upon request.  Respondent was released on bond pending trial.  In July 1989, however, he failed to appear in court, and the court issued an arrest warrant to secure his presence.  Respondent remained a fugitive for over 10 years, apparently settling in Tennessee.  The outstanding arrest warrant was finally executed in November 1999, after respondent was detained on an unrelated matter.  The State then reinstated the 1988 cocaine-possession charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before trial, the State informed respondent that in September 1999, the police, acting in accord with established procedures, had destroyed the substance seized from him during his arrest.  Respondent thereupon formally requested production of the substance and filed a motion to dismiss the cocaine-possession charge based on the State\xe2\x80\x99s destruction of evidence.  The trial court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to a jury trial.  The State introduced evidence tending to prove the facts recounted above.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief consisted solely of his own testimony, in which he denied that he ever possessed cocaine and insinuated that the police had \xe2\x80\x9cframed\xe2\x80\x9d him for the crime.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and respondent was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Appellate Court reversed the conviction, holding that the Due Process Clause required dismissal of the charge.  Relying on the Illinois Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Newberry</em>, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 288 (1995), the Appellate Court reasoned:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Where evidence is requested by the defense in a discovery motion, the State is on notice that the evidence must be preserved, and the defense is not required to make an independent showing that the evidence has exculpatory value in order to establish a due process violation.  If the State proceeds to destroy the evidence, appropriate sanctions may be imposed even if the destruction is inadvertent.  No showing of bad faith is necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 12 (quoting <em>Newberry, supra,</em> at 317, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 292) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Appellate Court observed that <em>Newberry</em> distinguished our decision in <em>Youngblood</em> on the ground that the police in <em>Youngblood</em> did not destroy evidence subsequent to a discovery motion by the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13.  While acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing in the record to indicate that the alleged cocaine was destroyed in bad faith,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 15, the court further determined that <em>Newberry </em>dictated dismissal because, unlike in <em>Youngblood</em>, the destroyed evidence provided respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9conly hope for exoneration,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 15, and was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16 (quoting <em>Newberry</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 315, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 291).  Consequently, the court concluded that respondent \xe2\x80\x9cwas denied due process when he was tried subsequent to the destruction of the alleged cocaine.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16<em>.  </em>The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have held that when the State suppresses or fails to disclose material exculpatory evidence, the good or bad faith of the prosecution is irrelevant: a due process violation occurs whenever such evidence is withheld.  See <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Agurs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/97/index.html">427 U. S. 97</a> (1976).  In <em>Youngblood</em>, by contrast, we recognized that the Due Process Clause \xe2\x80\x9crequires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  488 U. S., at 57.  We concluded that the failure to preserve this \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially useful evidence\xe2\x80\x9d does not violate due process \xe2\x80\x9c<em>unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 58 (emphasis added).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The substance seized from respondent was plainly the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially useful evidence\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in <em>Youngblood</em>, not the material exculpatory evidence addressed in <em>Brady</em> and <em>Agurs</em>.  At most, respondent could hope that, had the evidence been preserved, a <em>fifth</em> test conducted on the substance would have exonerated him.  See <em>Youngblood</em>, 488 U. S., at 57.  But respondent did not allege, nor did the Appellate Court find, that the Chicago police acted in bad faith when they destroyed the substance.  Quite the contrary, police testing indicated that the chemical makeup of the substance inculpated, not exculpated, respondent, see <em>id.,</em> at 57, n., and it is undisputed that police acted in \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith and in accord with their normal practice,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.</em>, at 56 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>California</em> v. <em>Trombetta,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/479/index.html">467 U. S. 479</a>, 488 (1984) (in turn quoting <em>Killian</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/231/index.html">368 U. S. 231</a>, 242 (1961))).  Under <em>Youngblood</em>, then, respondent has failed to establish a due process violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have never held or suggested that the existence of a pending discovery request eliminates the necessity of showing bad faith on the part of police.  Indeed, the result reached in this case demonstrates why such a <em>per se </em>rule would negate the very reason we adopted the bad-faith requirement in the first place: to \xe2\x80\x9climi[t] the extent of the police\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable grounds and confin[e] it to that class of cases where the interests of justice most clearly require it.\xe2\x80\x9d  488 U. S., at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also disagree that <em>Youngblood</em> does not apply whenever the contested evidence provides a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9conly hope for exoneration\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 15\xe2\x80\x93\n16 (citing <em>Newberry</em>, 166 Ill. 2d, at 315, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 291).  In <em>Youngblood</em>, the Arizona Court of Appeals said that the destroyed evidence \xe2\x80\x9ccould [have] eliminate[d] the defendant as a perpetrator.\xe2\x80\x9d 488 U. S., at 54.  Similarly here, an additional test might have provided the defendant with an opportunity to show that the police tests were mistaken.  It is thus difficult to distinguish the two cases on this basis.  But in any event, the applicability of the bad-faith requirement in <em>Youngblood </em>depended not on the centrality of the contested evidence to the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case or the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s defense, but on the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial exculpatory\xe2\x80\x9d evidence and \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially useful\xe2\x80\x9d evidence.  488 U. S., at 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  As we have held, <em>supra</em>, at 4, the substance destroyed here was, at best, \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially useful\xe2\x80\x9d evidence, and therefore <em>Youngblood</em>\xe2\x80\x99s bad-faith requirement applies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Respondent suggests that we lack jurisdiction because the Appellate Court relied on <em>Newberry</em>, which in turn relied on an adequate and independent state ground.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1040\xe2\x80\x931042 (1983).  Respondent is correct that <em>Newberry </em>relied on both the Due Process Clause, and in the alternative, Illinois Supreme Court Rule 415(g)(i).  166 Ill. 2d, at 314\xe2\x80\x93317, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 290\xe2\x80\x93292.  The Appellate Court, however, relied only on the portion of <em>Newberry</em> that addressed due process, and the Appellate Court based its decision solely on the Due Process Clause.  Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review that decision.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Long</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 1038, n.\xc2\xa04 (\xe2\x80\x9c[w]e may review a state case decided on a federal ground even if it is clear that there was an available state ground for decision on which the state court could properly have relied\xe2\x80\x9d) (citing <em>Beecher</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/35/index.html">389 U.

The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court has limited precedential value, and may well be reinstated on remand because the result is supported by the state-law holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Newberry,</em> 166 Ill.\xc2\xa02d 310, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 288 (1995).

S. 97</a>, 110 (1976).  Since <em>Youngblood </em>was decided, a number of state courts have held as a matter of state constitutional law that the loss or destruction of evidence critical to the defense does violate due process, even in the absence of bad faith.  As the Connecticut Supreme Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]airness dictates that when a person\xe2\x80\x99s liberty is at stake, the sole fact of whether the police or another state official acted in good or bad faith in failing to preserve evidence cannot be determinative of whether the criminal defendant received due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales,</em> 232 Conn. 707, 723, 657 A.\xc2\xa02d 585, 593 (1995).
