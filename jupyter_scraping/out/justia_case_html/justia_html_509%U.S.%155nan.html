Because so many interdicted Haitians could not be safely processed on Coast Guard cutters, the Department of Defense established temporary facilities at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo, Cuba, to accommodate them during the screening process. Those temporary facilities, however, had a capacity of only about 12,500 persons. In the first three weeks of May 1992, the Coast Guard intercepted 127 vessels (many of which were considered unseaworthy, overcrowded, and unsafe); those vessels carried 10,497 undocumented aliens. On May 22, 1992, the United States Navy determined that no additional migrants could safely be accommodated at Guantanamo. App.231-233.</p><p>With both the facilities at Guantanamo and available Coast Guard cutters saturated, and with the number of Haitian emigrants in unseaworthy craft increasing (many had drowned as they attempted the trip to Florida), the Government could no longer both protect our borders <i>and </i>offer the Haitians even a modified screening process. It had to choose between allowing Haitians into the United States for the screening process or repatriating them without giving them any opportunity to establish their qualifications as refugees. In the judgment of the President\'s advisers, the first choice not only would have defeated the original purpose of the program (controlling illegal immigration),</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="164">164</a></p><p>but also would have impeded diplomatic efforts to restore democratic government in Haiti and would have posed a life-threatening danger to thousands of persons embarking on long voyages in dangerous craft.12 The second choice would have advanced those policies but deprived the fleeing Haitians of any screening process at a time when a significant minority of them were being screened in.

They sued the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and the Commander of the Guantanamo Naval Base, complaining that the screening procedures provided on Coast Guard cutters and at Guantanamo did not adequately protect their statutory and treaty rights to apply for refugee status and avoid repatriation to Haiti.</p><p>They alleged that the September 1991 coup had "triggered a continuing widely publicized reign of terror in Haiti"; that over 1,500 Haitians were believed to "have been killed or subjected to violence and destruction of their property because of their political beliefs and affiliations"; and that thousands of Haitian refugees "have set out in small boats that</p><p>tinued orderly processing of more than 12,000 Haitians presently at Guantanamo.</p><p>"Through broadcasts on the Voice of America and public statements in the Haitian media we continue to urge Haitians not to attempt the dangerous sea journey to the United States.

Under the first phrase, however, any authority the Attorney General retains is subsidiary to that of the Coast Guard\'s leaders, who give the appropriate commands, and of the Coast Guard itself, which carries them out. As for the second phrase, under neither President Bush nor President Clinton has the Attorney General chosen to exercise those discretionary powers.

The most relevant of those responsibilities for our purposes are her conduct of the deportation and exclusion hearings in which requests for asylum or for withholding of deportation under \xc2\xa7 243(h) are ordinarily advanced. Since there is no provision in the statute for the conduct of such proceedings outside the United States, and since Part V and other provisions of the INA 29 obviously contemplate that such proceedings would be held in the country, we cannot reasonably construe \xc2\xa7 243(h) to limit the Attorney General\'s actions in geographic areas where she has not been authorized to conduct such proceedings. Part V of the INA contains no reference to a possible extraterritorial application.</p><p>Even if Part V of the Act were not limited to strictly domestic procedures, the presumption that Acts of Congress do not ordinarily apply outside our borders would support an interpretation of \xc2\xa7 243(h) as applying only within United States territory.

And if Congress had meant to refer to all aliens who might be sent back to potential oppressors, regardless of their location, the word "deport" would have been unnecessary. By using both words, the statute implies an exclusively territorial application, in the context of both kinds of domestic immigration proceedings. The use of both words reflects the traditional division between the two kinds of aliens and the two kinds of hearings. We can reasonably conclude that Congress used the two words "deport" and "return" only to make \xc2\xa7 243(h)\'s protection available in both deportation and exclusion proceedings. Indeed, the history of the 1980 amendment confirms that conclusion.</p><p>B. The History of the Refugee Act of 1980</p><p>As enacted in 1952, \xc2\xa7 243(h) authorized the Attorney General to withhold deportation of aliens "within the United States." 30 Six years later we considered the question whether it applied to an alien who had been paroled into the country while her admissibility was being determined. We held that even though she was physically present within our borders, she was not "within the United States" as those words were used in \xc2\xa7 243(h). <i>Leng May Ma </i>v. <i>Barber, 357</i></p><p>3066 Stat. 214; see also n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="175">175</a></p><p>u.

In the latter instance the Court has recognized additional rights and privileges not extended to those in the former category who are merely \'on the threshold of initial entry.\' <i>Shaughnessy </i>v. <i>United States ex rel.

The distinction was carefully preserved in Title II of the Immigration and Nationality Act." <i>Id., </i>at 187.</p></blockquote><p>Under the IN A, both then and now, those seeking "admission" and trying to avoid "exclusion" were already within our territory (or at its border), but the law treated them as though they had never entered the United States at all; they were within United States territory but not "within the United States." Those who had been admitted (or found their way in) but sought to avoid "expulsion" had the added benefit of "deportation proceedings"; they were both within United States territory <i>and </i>"within the United States." <i>Ibid. </i>Although the phrase "within the United States" presumed the alien\'s actual presence in the United States, it had more to do with an alien\'s legal status than with his location.</p><p>The 1980 amendment erased the long-maintained distinction between deportable and excludable aliens for purposes of \xc2\xa7 243(h).

The removal of the phrase "within the United States" cured the most obvious drawback of \xc2\xa7 243(h): As interpreted in <i>Leng May Ma, </i>its protection was available only to aliens subject to deportation proceedings.</p><p>Of course, in addition to this most obvious purpose, it is possible that the 1980 amendment <i>also </i>removed any territorial limitation of the statute, and Congress might have intended a double-barreled result.32 That possibility, however, is not a substitute for the affirmative evidence of intended extraterritorial application that our cases require. Moreover, in our review of the history of the amendment, we have found no support whatsoever for that latter, alternative, purpose.</p><p>The addition of the phrase "or return" and the deletion of the phrase "within the United States" are the only relevant changes made by the 1980 amendment to \xc2\xa7 243(h)(1), and they are fully explained by the intent to apply \xc2\xa7 243(h) to exclusion as well as to deportation proceedings. That intent is plainly identified in the legislative history of the amendment.33 There is no change in the 1980 amendment, however, that could only be explained by an assumption that Congress also intended to provide for the statute\'s extraterritorial application. It would have been extraordinary for Congress to make such an important change in the law without any mention of that possible effect. Not a scintilla of evidence of such an intent can be found in the legislative history.</p><p>32 Even respondents acknowledge that \xc2\xa7 243(h) did not apply extraterritorially before its amendment.

Or, just as the statute might have imposed an extraterritorial obligation that the Convention does not (the argument we have just rejected), the Convention might have established an extraterritorial obligation which the statute does not; under the Supremacy Clause, that broader treaty obligation might then provide the controlling rule of law.35 With those possibilities in mind we shall consider both the text and negotiating history of the Convention itself.</p><p>Like the text and the history of \xc2\xa7 243(h), the text and negotiating history of Article 33 of the United Nations Convention are both completely silent with respect to the Article\'s possible application to actions taken by a country outside its own borders.

The Text of the Convention</p><p>Two aspects of Article 33\'s text are persuasive. The first is the explicit reference in Article 33.2 to the country in which the alien is located; the second is the parallel use of the terms "expel or return," the latter term explained by the French word "refouler."</p><p>The full text of Article 33 reads as follows:</p><p align="center">\n"Article 33.-Prohibition of Expulsion or Return (\'refoulement\')</p><blockquote><p>\n"1. No Contracting State shall expel or return <i>(\'re</i><i>fouler\') </i>a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of <i>the country in which he is, </i>or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country." Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, July 28, 1951, 19 U. S. T. 6259, 6276, T. 1. A. S. No. 6577 (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>Under the second paragraph of Article 33 an alien may not claim the benefit of the first paragraph if he poses a danger to the country in which he is located. If the first paragraph did apply on the high seas, no nation could invoke the second paragraph\'s exception with respect to an alien there: An alien intercepted on the high seas is in no country at all. If Article 33.1 applied extraterritorially, therefore, Article 33.2</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="180">180</a></p><p>would create an absurd anomaly: Dangerous aliens on the high seas would be entitled to the benefits of 33.1 while those residing in the country that sought to expel them would not. It is more reasonable to assume that the coverage of 33.2 was limited to those already in the country because it was understood that 33.1 obligated the signatory state only with respect to aliens within its territory.36</p><p>Article 33.1 uses the words "expel or return (\'refouler\')" as an obvious parallel to the words "deport or return" in \xc2\xa7 243(h)(1). There is no dispute that "expel" has the same meaning as "deport"; it refers to the deportation or expulsion of an alien who is already present in the host country. The dual reference identified and explained in our opinion in <i>Leng May Ma </i>v. <i>Barber </i>suggests that the term "return (\'refouler\')" refers to the exclusion of aliens who are merely" \'on the threshold of initial entry.\'" 357 U. S., at 187 (quoting <i>Shaughnessy </i>v. <i>United States ex rel. Mezei, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/206/case.html">345 U. S. 206</a>, 212 (1953)).</p><p>This suggestion-that "return" has a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning-is reinforced by the parenthetical reference to <i>"refouler," </i>a French word that is <i>not </i>an exact synonym for the English word "return." Indeed, neither of two respected English-French dictionaries mentions <i>"refouler" </i>as one of many possible French translations</p><p>36 Although the parallel provision in \xc2\xa7 243(h)(2)(D), 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 243(h) (2)(D), that was added to the INA in 1980 does not contain the "country in which he is" language, the general understanding that it was intended to conform the statute to the Protocol leads us to give it that reading, particularly since its text is otherwise so similar to Article 33.2. It provides that \xc2\xa7 243(h)(I) "shall not apply" to an alien if the Attorney General determines that "there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States." Thus the statutory term "security of the United States" replaces the Protocol\'s term "security of the country in which he is."

The Negotiating History of the Convention</p><p>In early drafts of the Convention, what finally emerged as Article 33 was numbered 28. At a negotiating conference of plenipotentiaries held in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 11, 1951, the Swiss delegate explained his understanding that the words "expel" and "return" covered only refugees who had entered the host country. He stated:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Mr. ZUTTER (Switzerland) said that the Swiss Federal Government saw no reason why article 28 should not be adopted as it stood; for the article was a necessary one. He thought, however, that its wording left room for various interpretations, particularly as to the meaning to be attached to the words \'expel\' and \'return\'. In the Swiss Government\'s view, the term "expulsion" applied to a refugee who had already been admitted to the territory of a country. The term <i>\'refoulement\', </i>on the other hand, had a vaguer meaning; <i>it could not, however, be applied to a refugee who had not yet entered the territory of a country. </i>The word \'return\', used in the English text, gave that idea exactly. Yet article 28 implied the existence of two categories of refugee: refugees who were liable to be expelled, and those who were liable to be returned. In any case, the States represented at the Conference should take a definite position with regard to the meaning to be attached to the word \'return\'. The Swiss Government considered that in the</p></blockquote><p>territory of the Contracting State? ... There is thus a serious gap in refugee law as established by the 1951 Convention and other related instruments and it is high time that this gap should be filled"); Robinson, Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, at 163 ("[I]f a refugee has succeeded in eluding the frontier guards, he is safe; if he has not, it is his hard luck. It cannot be said that this is a satisfactory solution of the problem of asylum"); Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in International Law, at 87 ("A categorical refusal of disembarkation cannot be equated with breach of the principle of <i>non-refoulement, </i>even though it may result in serious consequences for asylum-seekers").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="185">185</a></p><blockquote><p>\npresent instance <i>the word applied solely to refugees who had already entered a country, but were not yet resident there. </i>According to that interpretation, States were not compelled to allow large groups of persons claiming refugee status to cross its frontiers. He would be glad to know whether the States represented at the Conference accepted his interpretations of the two terms in question. If they did, Switzerland would be willing to accept article 28, which was one of the articles in respect of which States could not, under article 36 of the draft Convention, enter a reservation." (Emphases added.) 42</p></blockquote><p>No one expressed disagreement with the position of the Swiss delegate on that day or at the session two weeks later when Article 28 was again discussed. At that session, the delegate of the Netherlands recalled the Swiss delegate\'s earlier position:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Baron van BOETZELAER (Netherlands) recalled that at the first reading the Swiss representative had expressed the opinion that the word \'expulsion\' related to a refugee already admitted into a country, whereas the word \'return\' <i>(\'refoulement\') </i>related to a refugee <i>already within the territory but not yet resident there. </i>According to that interpretation, article 28 would not have involved any obligations in the possible case of mass migrations across frontiers or of attempted mass migrations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"He wished to revert to that point, because the Netherlands Government attached very great importance to the scope of the provision now contained in article 33.

The negotiating history, which suggests that the Convention\'s limited reach resulted from a deliberate bargain, is not dispositive, but it solidly supports our reluctance to interpret Article 33 to impose obligations on the contracting parties that are broader than the text commands.

For this proposition the Court relies almost entirely on the fact that <i>American </i>law makes a general distinction between <i>deportation </i>and <i>exclusion. </i>Without explanation, the majority asserts that in light of this distinction the word "return" as used in the treaty somehow must refer only to "the exclusion of aliens who are ... \'on the threshold of initial entry.\'\'\' <i>Ibid. </i>(citation omitted).</p><p>Setting aside for the moment the fact that respondents in this case seem very much "on the threshold of initial entry"-at least in the eyes of the Government that has ordered them seized for "attempting to come to the United States by sea without necessary documentation," Preamble to Exec. Order No. 12807, 57 Fed. Reg. 23133 (1992)-1 find this tortured reading unsupported and unnecessary. The text of the Convention does not ban the "exclusion" of aliens who have reached some indeterminate "threshold"; it bans their "return." It is well settled that a treaty must first be construed according to its "ordinary meaning." Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155 U. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 1. L. M. 679 (1969). The ordinary meaning of "return" is "to bring, send, or put (a person or thing) back to or in a former position." Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 1941 (1986). That describes precisely what petitioners are doing to the Haitians. By dispensing with ordinary meaning at the outset, and by taking instead as its starting point the assumption that "return," as used in the treaty, "has a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning," <i>ante, </i>at 180, the majority leads itself astray.</p><p>The straightforward interpretation of the duty of nonreturn is strongly reinforced by the Convention\'s use of the French term <i>"refouler." </i>The ordinary meaning of <i>"refouler," </i>as the majority concedes, <i>ante, </i>at 181-182, is "[t]o repulse, ... ; to drive back, to repel."

" That, of course, is exactly what the Government is doing. It thus is no surprise that when the French press has described the very policy challenged here, the term it has used is <i>"refouler." </i>See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Le bourbier hai\'tien, </i>Le Monde, May 31-June 1, 1992 ("[L]es Etats-Unis ont decide de refouler directement les refugies recueillis par la garde cotiere." (The United States has decided [de refouler] directly the refugees picked up by the Coast Guard)).</p><p>And yet the majority insists that what has occurred is not, in fact, <i>"refoulement." </i>It reaches this conclusion in a peculiar fashion. After acknowledging that the ordinary meaning of <i>"refouler" </i>is "repulse," "repel," and "drive back," the majority without elaboration declares: "To the extent that they are relevant, these translations imply that \'return\' means a defensive act of resistance or exclusion at a border .... " <i>Ante, </i>at 181-182. I am at a loss to find the narrow notion of "exclusion at a border" in broad terms like "repulse," "repel," and "drive back." Gage was repulsed (initially) at Bunker Hill. Lee was repelled at Gettysburg. Rommel was driven back across North Africa. The majority\'s puzzling progression <i>("refouler" </i>means repel or drive back; therefore "return" means only exclude at a border; therefore the treaty does not apply) hardly justifies a departure from the path of ordinary meaning. The text of Article</p><p>4 The Court seems no more convinced than I am by petitioners\' argument that "refouler" is best translated as "expel." See Brief for Petitioners 38-39. That interpretation, as the Second Circuit observed, would leave the treaty redundantly forbidding a nation to "expel" or "expel" a refugee. <i>Haitian Centers Council, Inc. </i>v. <i>McNary, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/969/1350/">969 F.2d 1350</a>, 1363 (1992).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="193">193</a></p><p>33.1 is clear, and whether the operative term is "return" or <i>"refouler," </i>it prohibits the Government\'s actions.5</p><p>Article 33.1 is clear not only in what it says, but also in what it does not say: It does not include any geographical limitation.

"). <i>Ante, </i>at 181-182. The first assumption suggests disregard for the basic rule that consideration of a treaty\'s ordinary meaning must be the first step in its interpretation. The second assumption, by neglecting to treat the term <i>"refouler" </i>as significant in and of itself, overlooks the fact that under Article 46 the French and English versions of the Convention\'s text are equally authoritative.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="194">194</a></p><p>removed from the Article\'s protection all refugees who "constitute a danger to their families." By the majority\'s logic, the inclusion of such an exception presumably would render Article 33.1 applicable only to refugees with families.</p><p>Far from constituting "an absurd anomaly," <i>ante, </i>at 180, the fact that a state is permitted to "expel or return" a small class of refugees found within its territory but may not seize and return refugees who remain outside its frontiers expresses precisely the objectives and concerns of the Convention. Nonreturn is the rule; the sole exception (neither applicable nor invoked here) is that a nation endangered by a refugee\'s very presence may "expel or return" him to an unsafe country if it chooses. The tautological observation that only a refugee already in a country can pose a danger to the country "in which he is" proves nothing.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The majority further relies on a remark by Baron van Boetzelaer, the Netherlands\' delegate at the Convention\'s negotiating conference, to support its contention that Article 33 does not apply extraterritorially. This reliance, for two reasons, is misplaced. First, the isolated statement of a delegate to the Convention cannot alter the plain meaning of the treaty itself. Second, placed in its proper context, Van Boetzelaer\'s comment does not support the majority\'s position.</p><p>It is axiomatic that a treaty\'s plain language must control absent "extraordinarily strong contrary evidence." <i>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </i>v. <i>Avagliano, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/176/case.html">457 U.

Reliance on a treaty\'s negotiating history <i>(travaux preparatoires) </i>is a disfavored alternative of last resort, appropriate only where the terms of the document are obscure or lead to "manifestly absurd or unreasonable" results.

Moreover, even the general rule of treaty construction allowing limited resort to <i>travaux preparatoires </i>"has no application to oral statements made by those engaged in negotiating the treaty which were not embodied in any writing and were not communicated to the government of the negotiator or to its ratifying body." <i>Arizona </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/292/341/case.html">292 U.

There is no evidence that the comment on which the majority relies was ever communicated to the United States Government or to the Senate in connection with the ratification of the Protocol.</p><p>The pitfalls of relying on the negotiating record are underscored by the fact that Baron van Boetzelaer\'s remarks almost certainly represent, in the words of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a mere "parliamentary gesture by a delegate whose views did <i>not </i>prevail upon the negotiating conference as a whole" (emphasis in original). Brief for Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>24. The Baron, like the Swiss delegate whose sentiments he restated, expressed a desire to reserve the right to <i>close borders </i>to <i>large groups </i>of refugees.

Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons, Summary Record of the Sixteenth Meeting, U. N. Doc. A/CONF.2/SR.16, p. 6 (July 11, 1951). Article 33, Van Boetzelaer maintained, "would not have involved any obligations in the possible case of mass migrations across frontiers or of attempted mass migrations" and this was important because "[t]he Netherlands could not accept any legal obligations in respect of large groups of refugees seeking access to its territory." Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons, Summary Record of the Thirty-fifth Meeting, U. N. Doc.

Ad Hoc Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems, Summary Record of the Twenty-First Meeting, U. N. Doc. E/AC.32/SR.21, pp. 4-5 (1950). Consistent with the United States\' historically strong support of nonreturn, the United States delegate to the Committee, Louis Henkin, confirmed this:</p><p>\'\'Whether it was a question of closing the frontier to a refugee who asked admittance, or of turning him back after he had crossed the frontier, or even of expelling him after he had been admitted to residence in the territory, the problem was more or less the same.</p><p>\'\'Whatever the case might be ... he must not be turned back to a country where his life or freedom could be threatened.

Not one of these authorities suggests that any signatory nation sought to reserve the right to seize refugees outside its territory and forcibly return them to their persecutors. Indeed, the first work cited explains that the entire reason for the drafting of Article 33 was "the consideration that the turning back of a refugee to the frontiers of a country where his life or freedom is threatened on account of race or similar grounds would be tantamount to delivering him into the hands of his persecutors."

"The officers of the Coast Guard insofar as they are engaged ... in enforcing any law of the United States shall ... be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular executive department ...  charged with the administration of the particular law ...  and ... be subject to all the rules and regulations promulgated by such department ... with respect to the enforcement of that law." 14 U. S. C. \xc2\xa789(b). The Coast Guard is engaged in enforcing the immigration laws. The sole identified purpose of Executive Order No. 12807 is to address the "serious problem of persons attempting to come to the United States by sea without necessary documentation and otherwise illegally." 57 Fed.

The Coast Guard\'s task under the order is "to enforce the suspension of the entry of undocumented aliens by sea and the interdiction of any defined vessel carrying such aliens." <i>Ibid. </i>The Coast Guard is authorized to return a vessel and its passengers <i>only </i>"when there is reason to believe that an offense is being committed against the United States immigration laws, or appropriate laws of a foreign country with which we have an arrangement to assist." <i>Id., </i>at 23134.</p><p>The majority suggests indirectly that the law which the Coast Guard enforces when it carries out the order to return a vessel reasonably believed to be violating the immigration laws is somehow not a law that the Attorney General is charged with administering. <i>Ante, </i>at 171-173. That suggestion is baseless. Under 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 l103(a), the Attorney General, with some exceptions, "shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens .... " The majority acknowledges this designation, but speculates that the particular enforcement of immigration laws here may be covered by the exception for laws relating to "\'the powers, functions, and duties conferred upon the President, the Secretary of State, the officers of the Department of State, or diplomatic or consular officers .... \'" <i>Ante, </i>at 171.9 The majority fails to point out the proviso</p><p>9 The Executive Order at issue cited as authority 8 U.

The Haitians, of course, do not claim a right of entry.</p><p>Indeed, the very invocation of this section in this context is somewhat of a stretch. The section pertains to the President\'s power to interrupt for as long as necessary <i>legal </i>entries into the United States. Illegal entries cannot be "suspended"-they are already disallowed. Nevertheless, the Proclamation on which the Order relies declares, solemnly and hopefully: "The entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas is hereby</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="201">201</a></p><p>that directly follows the exception: <i>"Provided, however, </i>That ... the Attorney General .... shall have the power and duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens .... " There can be no doubt that the Coast Guard is acting as the Attorney General\'s agent when it seizes and returns undocumented aliens.</p><p>Even the challenged Executive Order places the Attorney General "on the boat" with the Coast Guard.10 The Order purports to give the Attorney General "unreviewable discretion" to decide that an alien will not be returned.ll Discretion not to return an alien is of course discretion to return him. Such discretion cannot be given; Congress removed it in 1980 when it amended the INA to make mandatory <i>("shall not </i>deport or <i>return") </i>what had been a discretionary function ("The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation"). The Attorney General may not decline to follow the command of \xc2\xa7 243(h). If she encounters a refugee, she must not return him to persecution.</p><p>The laws that the Coast Guard is engaged in enforcing when it takes to the seas under orders to prevent aliens from illegally crossing our borders are laws whose administration has been assigned to the Attorney General by Congress, which has plenary power over immigration matters. <i>Kleindienst </i>v. <i>Mandel, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/753/case.html">408 U.

Before 1980, \xc2\xa7 243(h) provided:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Attorney General is authorized to <i>withhold deportation </i>of any alien ... <i>within the United States </i>to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason." 8 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1253(h) (1976 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>The Refugee Act of 1980 explicitly amended this provision in three critical respects. Congress (1) deleted the words "within the United States"; (2) barred the Government from "return[ing]," as well as "deport[ing]," alien refugees; and (3) made the prohibition against return mandatory, thereby eliminating the discretion of the Attorney General over such decisions.</p><p>The import of these changes is clear. Whether "within the United States" or not, a refugee may not be returned to his persecutors. To read into \xc2\xa7 243(h)\'s mandate a territorial restriction is to restore the very language that Congress removed. "Few principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend <i>sub silentio </i>to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language." <i>INS </i>v. <i>CardozaFonseca, </i>480 U. S., at 442-443 (citations omitted). Moreover, as all parties to this case acknowledge, the 1980 changes were made in order to conform our law to the United Nations Protocol. As has been shown above, that treaty\'s absolute ban on <i>refoulement </i>is similarly devoid of territorial restrictions.</p><p>The majority, however, downplays the significance of the deletion of "within the United States" to improvise a unique</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="203">203</a></p><p>meaning for "return." 12 It does so not by analyzing Article 33, the provision that inspired the 1980 amendments,13 but by reference to a lone case from this Court that is not even mentioned in the legislative history and that had been on the books a full 22 years before the amendments\' enactment.</p><p>In <i>Leng May Ma </i>v. <i>Barber, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/185/case.html">357 U. S. 185</a> (1958), this Court decided that aliens paroled into the United States from detention at the border were not "within the United States" for purposes of the former \xc2\xa7 243(h) and thus were not entitled to its benefits. Pointing to this decision, the majority offers the negative inference that Congress\' removal of the words "within the United States" was meant only to extend a right of nonreturn to those in exclusion proceedings. But nothing in <i>Leng May Ma </i>even remotely suggests that the <i>only </i>persons not "within the United States" are those involved in exclusion proceedings. Indeed, such a suggestion would have been ridiculous. Nor does the narrow concept of exclusion relate in any obvious way to the amendment\'s broad phrase "return any alien."</p><p>The problems with the majority\'s <i>Leng May Ma </i>theory run deeper, however. When Congress in 1980 removed the</p><p>12 The word "return" is used throughout the INA; in no instance is there any indication that the word has a specialized meaning. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>8 </i>U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1l01(a)(27)(A) ("special immigrant" is one lawfully admitted "who is <i>returning </i>from a temporary visit abroad" (emphasis added)); 1l01(a)(42)(A) ("refugee" is a person outside his own country who is "unable or unwilling to <i>return </i>to" his country because of persecution (emphasis added)); 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(I) (nonimmigrant who does not possess passport authorizing him "to <i>return </i>to the country from which" he came is excludable (emphasis added)); 1252(a)(1) (deportable alien\'s parole may be revoked and the alien <i>"returned </i>to custody" (emphasis added)); 1353 (travel expenses will be paid for INS officers who "become eligible for voluntary retirement and <i>return </i>to the United States" (emphasis added)). It is axiomatic that "identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning." <i>Atlantic Cleaners </i>&amp; <i>Dyers, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/427/case.html">286 U. S. 427</a>,433 (1932).</p><p>13 Indeed, reasoning backwards, the majority actually looks to the <i>American </i>scheme to illuminate the <i>treaty. </i>See <i>ante, </i>at 180-181.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="204">204</a></p><p>phrase "within the United States," it did not substitute any other geographical limitation. This failure is exceedingly strange in light of the majority\'s hypothesis that the deletion was intended solely to work the particular technical adjustment of extending protection to those physically present in, yet not legally admitted to, the United States. It is even stranger given what Congress did elsewhere in the Act. The Refugee Act revised the immigration code to establish a comprehensive, tripartite system for the protection of refugees fleeing persecution.14 Section 207 governs overseas refugee processing. Section 208, in turn, governs asylum claims by aliens "physically present in the United States, or at a land border or port of entry." Unlike these sections, however, which explicitly apply to persons present in specific locations, the amended \xc2\xa7 243(h) includes no such limiting language. The basic prohibition against forced return to persecution applies simply to "any alien." The design of all three sections is instructive, and it undermines the majority\'s assertion that \xc2\xa7 243(h) was meant to apply only to aliens physically present in the United States or at one of its borders. When Congress wanted a provision to apply only to aliens "physically present in the United States, or at a land border or port of entry," it said so. See \xc2\xa7 208(a).15 An examination</p><p>14 For this reason, the majority is mistaken to find any significance in the fact that the ban on return is located in the part of the INA that deals as well with the deportation and exclusion hearings in which requests for asylum or for withholding of deportation "are ordinarily advanced." <i>Ante, </i>at 173.</p><p>15 Congress used the words "physically present within the United States" to delimit the reach not just of \xc2\xa7 208 but of sections throughout the INA. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>8 U. S.

The presumption runs throughout the majority\'s opinion, and it stacks the deck by requiring the Haitians to produce "affirmative evidence" that when Congress prohibited the return of "any" alien, it indeed meant to prohibit the interception and return of aliens at sea.</p><p>The judicially created canon of statutory construction against extraterritorial application of United States law has no role here, however. It applies only where congressional intent is "unexpressed." <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Arabian American Oil Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/case.html">499 U.

Here there is no room for</p><p>porary protected status). The majority offers no hypothesis for why Congress would not have done so here as well.</p><p>16 Even if the majority\'s <i>Leng May Ma </i>proposition were correct, it would not support today\'s result. Leng May Ma was an excludable alien who had been in custody but was paroled into the United States. The Court determined that her parole did not change her legal status, and therefore that her case should be analyzed as if she were still "in custody." The Court then explained that "the detention of an alien in custody pending determination of his admissibility does not legally constitute an entry though the alien is physically within the United States," and stated: "It seems quite clear that an alien so confined would not be \'within the United States\' for purposes of \xc2\xa7 243(h)." 357 U. S., at 188. <i>Leng May Ma </i>stands for the proposition that aliens in custody who have not made legal entries-including, but not limited to, those who are granted the privilege of parole-are legally outside the United States. According to the majority, Congress deleted the territorial reference in order to extend protection to such aliens. By the majority\'s own reasoning, then, \xc2\xa7 243(h) applies to unadmitted aliens held in United States custody. That, of course, is exactly the position in which the interdicted Haitians find themselves.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="206">206</a></p><p>doubt: A territorial restriction has been deliberately deleted from the statute.</p><p>Even where congressional intent is unexpressed, however, a statute must be assessed according to its intended scope. The primary basis for the application of the presumption (besides the desire-not relevant here-to avoid conflict with the laws of other nations) is "the commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind." <i>Smith </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/197/case.html">507 U. S. 197</a>, 204, n. 5 (1993). Where that notion seems unjustified or unenlightening, however, generally worded laws covering varying subject matters are routinely applied extraterritorially. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Hellenic Lines Ltd. </i>v. <i>Rhoditis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/306/case.html">398 U.

Whatever force the presumption may have with regard to a primarily domestic statute evaporates in this context. There is no danger that the Congress that enacted the Refugee Act was blind to the fact that the laws it was crafting had implications beyond this Nation\'s borders. The "commonsense notion" that Congress was looking inwards-perfectly valid in a case involving the Federal Tort Claims Act, such as <i>Smith,-cannot </i>be reasonably applied to the Refugee Act of 1980.</p><p>In this regard, the majority\'s dictum that the presumption has "special force" when we construe "statutory provisions that may involve foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility," <i>ante, </i>at 188, is completely wrong.
