As a condition of funding, a State must establish a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system \xe2\x80\x9cto protect and advocate [those individuals\xe2\x80\x99] rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715043(a)(1).  A participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system, but if a state agency it must have authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agencies or officers.  Virginia has appointed an independent state agency, petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), authorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals\xe2\x80\x99 rights, free of executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental hospitals, VOPA asked respondents\xe2\x80\x94state officials in charge of those hospitals\xe2\x80\x94to produce relevant patient records.  Respondents refused, asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclosure.  VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to produce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s right of access.  Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/index.html">209 U. S. 123</a>, which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that <em>Ex parte Young </em>did not apply because the suit was brought by a state agency.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0Ex parte Young</em> allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same State.

S. 89</a>.  It rests on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes.  It does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cwhen \xe2\x80\x98the state is the \xe2\x80\xa6 party in interest.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 101.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Entertaining VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s action is consistent with precedent and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0<em>Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/635/index.html">535 U. S. 635</a>, held that, in determining the <em>Ex parte Young</em> doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s applicability, \xe2\x80\x9ca court need only conduct a \xe2\x80\x98straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 645.  VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s suit satisfies that inquiry.  Respondents concede that the action would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a state agency.  The \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the <em>effect</em> of the relief sought,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pennhurst</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit.  This Court applied that criterion in <em>Idaho</em> v. <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe of Idaho</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/261/index.html">521 U. S. 261</a>, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke <em>Ex parte Young</em> to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would \xe2\x80\x9cextinguish [Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s] control over \xe2\x80\xa6 lands and waters long deemed \xe2\x80\xa6 an integral part of its territory.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Respondents claim that a State\xe2\x80\x99s dignity is diminished when a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components.  But a State\xe2\x80\x99s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own agency sues to enforce its officers\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with federal law than when a private person does so.  Moreover, VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s power to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s own decision to establish a public P&amp;A system.  Not every offense to a State\xe2\x80\x99s dignity constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity.  The specific indignity against which sovereign immunity<em> </em>protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit happens to be brought by another state agency.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence of past constitutional doubts.  In order to invoke the <em>Ex parte Young</em> exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such conditions rarely coincide.  In any event, the principles undergirding the <em>Ex parte Young</em> doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.

S. C. \xc2\xa715001 <em>et seq.</em>, offers States federal money to improve community services, such as medical care and job training,\xc2\xa0for individuals with developmental disabilities.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa715023(a), 15024.  As a condition of that funding, a State must establish a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system \xe2\x80\x9cto protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa715043(a)(1).  The P&amp;A system receives separate federal funds, paid to it directly.  \xc2\xa715042(a) and (b).  A second federal law, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act), 100 Stat. 478, 42  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710801 <em>et seq.</em>, increases that separate funding and extends the mission of P&amp;A systems to include the mentally ill.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710802(2), 10803, 10827.  At present, every State accepts funds under these statutes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&amp;A system must have certain powers.  The system \xe2\x80\x9cshall \xe2\x80\xa6 have the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect \xe2\x80\xa6 if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(B); \xc2\xa710805(a)(1)(A).  Subject to certain statutory requirements, it must be given access to \xe2\x80\x9call records\xe2\x80\x9d of individuals who may have been abused, see \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(I)(iii)(II); \xc2\xa710805(a)(4)(B)(iii), as well as \xe2\x80\x9cother records that are relevant to conducting an investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(J)(i).  The Acts also require that a P&amp;A system have authority to \xe2\x80\x9cpursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of\xe2\x80\x9d its charges.  \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(A)(i); see \xc2\xa710805(a)(1)(B).  And in addition to pressing its own rights, a P&amp;A system may \xe2\x80\x9cpursue administrative, legal, and other remedies on behalf of\xe2\x80\x9d those it protects.  \xc2\xa710805(a)(1)(C); see \xc2\xa715044(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A participating State is free to appoint either a state agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system.  \xc2\xa715044(a); \xc2\xa710805(c)(1)(B).  But in either case, the designated entity must have certain structural features that ensure its independence from the State\xe2\x80\x99s government.  The DD Act prohibits the Governor from appointing more than one-third of the members of the system\xe2\x80\x99s governing board, \xc2\xa715044(a)(2), and restricts the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to impose hiring freezes or other measures that would impair the system\xe2\x80\x99s ability to carry out its mission, \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(K).  Once a State designates an entity as its P&amp;A system, it may not change its selection without \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa715043(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated a government entity as their P&amp;A system.  The Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent state agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Va. Code Ann. \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x9339.2(A) (Lexis 2009).  Its board consists of eleven \xe2\x80\x9cnonlegislative citizen members,\xe2\x80\x9d of whom only three are appointed by\nthe Governor.  \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x9339.2(B).  The remaining eight are appointed by components of the legislature: five by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Senate Committee on Rules.  <em>Ibid.</em>  VOPA itself nominates candidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the appointing officials that they \xe2\x80\x9cshall seriously consider the persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Board members serve for fixed terms and are removable only by a court and only for specified reasons.  See \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x9339.2(C) and (F); \xc2\xa724.2\xe2\x80\x93233 and 234 (Lexis 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive-branch oversight.  It operates independently of the Attorney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who are statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x9339.2(A); \xc2\xa72.2\xe2\x80\x93510(5) (Lexis 2008).  And Virginia law specifically empowers VOPA to \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate any proceedings to secure the rights\xe2\x80\x9d of disabled individuals.  \xc2\xa751.5\xe2\x80\x9339.2(A).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental hospitals.  It asked respondents\xe2\x80\x94state officials in charge of those institutions\xe2\x80\x94to produce any records related to risk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the hospitals with respect to those patients.  Respondents refused, asserting that the records were protected by a state-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materials from disclosure.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0VOPA then brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review records, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that might apply.  It sought a declaration that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI Acts, along with an injunction requiring respondents to provide access to the records and refrain in the future from interfering with VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s right of access to them.  Respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.  The District Court denied the motion.  In its view, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young</em>, which normally allows federal courts to award prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Reinhard</em>, 2008 WL 2795940, *6 (ED Va., July 18, 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed.  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Reinhard</em>, 568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009).  Believing VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit to be an \xe2\x80\x9cintramural contest\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cencroaches more severely on the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an <em>Ex parte Young</em> action brought by a private plaintiff,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case<em>.</em> <em>Id.</em>, at 119\xe2\x80\x93120 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  561 U.

The language of the Eleventh Amendment[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] only eliminates the basis for our judgment in the famous case of <em>Chisholm</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), which involved a suit against a State by a noncitizen of the State.  Since <em>Hans</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/134/1/index.html">134 U. S. 1</a> (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to confirm the structural understanding that States entered the Union with their sovereign immunity intact, unlimited by Article III\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional grant.  <em>Blatchford</em> v. <em>Native Village of Noatak</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/index.html">501 U.

A railroad shareholder claimed that the new rates were un-constitutionally confiscatory, and obtained a federal\ninjunction against Edward Young, the Attorney General of Minnesota, forbidding him in his official capacity to enforce the state law.  <em>Perkins</em> v. <em>Northern Pacific</em> <em>R. Co.</em>, 155 F. 445 (CC Minn. 1907).  When Young violated the injunction by initiating an enforcement action in state court, the Circuit Court held him in contempt and committed him to federal custody.  In his habeas corpus application in this Court, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity deprived the federal court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his official duties.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagreed.  We explained that because an unconstitutional legislative enactment is \xe2\x80\x9cvoid,\xe2\x80\x9d a state official who enforces that law \xe2\x80\x9ccomes into conflict with the superior authority of [the] Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore is \xe2\x80\x9cstripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.

S. 261</a>, 296 (1997) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).  There is no doubt VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s suit satisfies that straightforward inquiry.  It alleges that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to produce the requested medical records violates federal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the production of the records, which would prospectively abate the alleged violation.  Respondents concede that were VOPA a private organization rather than a state agency, the doctrine would permit this action to proceed.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We see no reason for a different result here.  Although respondents argue that VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s status as a state agency changes the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for making the validity of an <em>Ex parte Young</em> action turn on the identity of the plaintiff.  To be sure, we have been willing to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to evade sovereign immunity.  To do otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cwould be\nto adhere to an empty formalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 270.  But (as the dissent concedes, <em>post</em>, at 8 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.)) the limits we have recognized reflect the principle that the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral criterion for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the <em>effect</em> of the relief sought,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pennhurst</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit.  Thus, <em>Ex parte Young</em> cannot be used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of funds from the State\xe2\x80\x99s treasury, see <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Jordan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/index.html">415 U. S. 651</a>, 666 (1974); or an order for specific performance of a State\xe2\x80\x99s contract, see <em>id.</em>, at 666\xe2\x80\x93667; <em>In re Ayers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/123/443/index.html">123 U.

There we refused to allow an Indian Tribe to use <em>Ex parte Young</em> to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief establishing its exclusive right to the use and enjoyment of certain submerged lands in Idaho and the invalidity of all state statutes and regulations governing that land.  521 U.

We determined that the suit was \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of a quiet title suit against Idaho,\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9cextinguish \xe2\x80\xa6 the State\xe2\x80\x99s control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus was barred by sovereign immunity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 282.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents have advanced no argument that the relief sought in this case threatens any similar invasion of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.  Indeed, they concede that the very injunction VOPA requests could properly be awarded by a federal court at the instance of a private P&amp;A system.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents and the dissent argue that entertaining VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit in a federal forum would nevertheless infringe Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign interests because it diminishes the dignity of a State for a federal court to adjudicate a dispute between its components.  See Brief for Respondents 23\xe2\x80\x9326; <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x938 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special sovereignty interests\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d bar VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit (quoting <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 281)).  We disagree.  As an initial matter, we do not understand how a State\xe2\x80\x99s stature could be diminished to any greater degree when <em>its own agency</em> polices its officers\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with their federal obligations, than when <em>a private person</em> hales those officers into federal court for that same purpose\xe2\x80\x94something everyone agrees is proper.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And in this case, of course, VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s power to sue state officials is a consequence of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s own decision to establish a public, rather than a private, P&amp;A system.  We fail to perceive what Eleventh Amendment indignity is visited on the Commonwealth when, by operation of its own laws, VOPA is admitted to federal court as a plaintiff.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if it were true that the State\xe2\x80\x99s dignity were offended in some way by the maintenance of this action in federal court, that would not prove respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case.  Denial of sovereign immunity, to be sure, offends the dignity of a State; but not every offense to the dignity of a State constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity.  The specific indignity against which sovereign immunity<em> </em>protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent.  That effectively occurs, our cases reasonably conclude, when (for example) the object of the suit against a state officer is to reach funds in the state treasury or acquire state lands; it does not occur just because the suit happens to be brought by another state agency.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 asserted dignitary harm is simply unconnected to the sovereign-immunity interest.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent complains that applying <em>Ex parte Young</em> to this lawsuit divides Virginia against itself, since the opposing parties are both creatures of the Commonwealth.  <em>Post</em>, at 7.  Even if that were a distinctive consequence of letting this suit proceed in federal court, it would have nothing to do with the concern of sovereign-immunity\xe2\x80\x94whether the suit is against an unconsenting State, rather than against its officers.  But it is <em>not</em> a consequence of the federal nature of the forum.  The same result will follow if the federal claim is sued upon in state court, as the dissent would require.  There also, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever the decision in the litigation, \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he Commonwealth will win[, a]nd the Commonwealth will lose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nor would sending the matter to state court even avoid the prospect that \xe2\x80\x9ca federal judge will resolve which part of the Commonwealth will prevail,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., since the state-court loser could always ask <em>this</em> Court to review the matter by certiorari.  (Or is that appeal also to be disallowed on grounds of sovereign immunity?  But see <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821).)[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And of course precisely the same thing would happen if respondents specifically waived their sovereign-immunity objections <em>in this very case.</em>  Yet no one would contend that despite the waiver, sovereign immunity forbade the suit.  So also here:  If, by reason of <em>Ex parte Young</em>, there has been no violation of sovereign immunity, the prospect of a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s resolving VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s dispute with respondents does not make it so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not doubt, of course, that there are limits on the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to affect the internal operations of a State.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a> (1997) (Congress may not commandeer state officers); <em>Coyle</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/221/559/index.html">221 U. S. 559</a>, 579 (1911) (Congress may not dictate a State\xe2\x80\x99s capital).  But those limits must be found in some textual provision or structural premise of the Constitution.  Additional limits cannot be smuggled in under the Eleventh Amendment by barring a  suit in federal court that does not violate the State\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </font></p><font super="1">\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A weightier objection, perhaps, is the relative novelty of this lawsuit.  Respondents rightly observe that federal courts have not often encountered lawsuits brought by state agencies against other state officials.  That does give us pause.  Lack of historical precedent can indicate a constitutional infirmity, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Free Enterprise Fund </em>v.<em> Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</em>, 561 U. S. ____, ____ (2010) (slip op., at 25), and our sovereign-immunity decisions have traditionally warned against \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or suits,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alden</em>, 527 U. S., at 727 (quoting <em>Hans</em>, 134 U. S., at 18).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Novelty, however, is often the consequence of past constitutional doubts, but we have no reason to believe that is the case here.  In order to invoke the <em>Ex parte Young</em> exception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two things: first, a federal right that it possesses against its parent State; and second, authority to sue other state officials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto wielded by the state government.  These conditions will rarely coincide\xe2\x80\x94and at least the latter of them cannot exist without the consent of the State that created the agency and defined its powers.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  We are unaware that the necessary conditions have ever presented themselves except in connection with the DD and PAIMI Acts, and the parties have referred us to no examples.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Thus, the apparent novelty of this sort of suit does not at all suggest its unconstitutionality.  In any event, we are satisfied, for the reasons we have explained, that\xe2\x80\x94novelty notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x94the principles undergirding the <em>Ex parte Young</em> doc-trine support its application to actions of this kind.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, we are mindful of the central role autonomous States play in our federal system, and wary of approving new encroachments on their sovereignty.  But we conclude no such encroachment is occasioned by straightforwardly applying <em>Ex parte Young</em> to allow this suit.  It was Virginia law that created VOPA and gave it the power to sue state officials.  In that circumstance, the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle to VOPA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to invoke federal jurisdiction on the same terms as any other litigant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Amendment reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have recognized that Congress may abrogate a State\xe2\x80\x99s immunity when it acts under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html">517 U.

The reason we refused to permit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act<em> </em>created an alternative remedial scheme that would be undermined by permitting <em>Ex parte Young</em> suits; <em>Congress</em>, we said, had foreclosed recourse to the doctrine.

In <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Jordan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/index.html">415 U.

And <em>Pennhurst </em>declined to extend <em>Young</em> to suits alleging a state-law violation, for without the need to ensure the supremacy of federal law there was no justification for restricting state sovereignty.  465 U.

As a result, <em>Verizon Md.</em> incorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to reject.  <em>Verizon Md. </em>itself was an easy case, for it involved the same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense that was at issue in <em>Young</em>.  But when <em>Young</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application is explored in novel contexts, as in <em>Idaho</em> v. <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe of Idaho</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/261/index.html">521 U. S. 261</a> (1997), and also in this case, the inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cproves more complex,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Verizon Md., supra, at</em> 648 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy may rely on <em>Young</em>, despite the somewhat striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue officials of the same State in federal court.  In the posture of the case as it comes before the Court, it must be assumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it seeks, and so the extension of <em>Young </em>would vindicate the Supremacy Clause.  To be balanced against this important interest is the need to preserve \xe2\x80\x9cthe dignity and respect afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 268.  Permitting a state agency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does implicate the State\xe2\x80\x99s important sovereign interest in using its own courts to control the distribution of power among its own agents.  But the affront to the State\xe2\x80\x99s dignity is diminished to some extent when it is noted that if the State had elected the alternate course of designating a private protection and advocacy system it then would have avoided any risk of internal conflict while still participating in the federal program.  The availability of that alternate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of the validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only question here is the reach of the <em>Young </em>exception.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the holding here upsets the federal balance is further mitigated by the various protections built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure that state officials do not too often call upon the federal courts to resolve their intramural disputes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, and most important, state law must authorize an agency or official to sue another arm of the State.  If States do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in federal court, they need not empower their officers or agencies to sue one another in a federal forum.  And if state officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they may invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal capacities.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state law as to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s or agency\xe2\x80\x99s power to sue, or any other state-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts should abstain under <em>Railroad Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Tex.</em> v. <em>Pullman Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/index.html">312 U. S. 496</a> (1941).  <em>Pullman</em> recognizes the importance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial intervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is necessary.  If an open question of state-law would resolve a dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution of the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.  Likewise, certification of questions of state law to the state courts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal controversy.  <em>Lehman Brothers</em> v. <em>Schein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/386/index.html">416 U. S. 386</a>, 391 (1974) (Certification \xe2\x80\x9chelps build a cooperative judicial federalism\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state officials or agencies to assert against other arms of the State.  True, officials may assert that their personal federal rights are violated by unlawful state action, for example where the State engages in discriminatory employment practices.  But the statutory framework in the case now before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state agency itself with federal rights against the State.  Statutes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers or agencies, and the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s rights-creating Clauses protect persons rather than officers.  Because the <em>Young </em>exception is available only to those who assert federal violations, the paucity of federal rights vested in government officials makes the scope of the holding here a narrow one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All this is simply to underscore that the program at issue may present constitutional questions but that the parties do not raise them in this litigation.  Virginia does not argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spending power under Article I, \xc2\xa78 by forcing a state that wishes to designate a public agency as its advocacy system to allow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring that the agency be structured as Congress directs.  <em>E.g.</em>, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715043(a)(2)(G) (system must \xe2\x80\x9cbe independent of any agency that provides treatment, services, or habilitation to individuals with developmental disabilities\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa715044(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the governing board may be appointed by the chief executive officer of the State\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Young</em>\xe2\x80\x94a court-made doctrine based on convenience, fiction, or both\xe2\x80\x94neither implicates nor subsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the excessive exercise of federal power.  The Court should be most cautious before deciding cases that might later lead to a general principle that the National Government can condition receipt of funds on the State\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to make far-reaching changes with respect to its governmental structure or its basic policies of governance in matters within its special competence.  Assuming, as the Court must, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow question is whether VOPA may rely on <em>Young</em> to avoid the sovereign immunity bar.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One might doubt whether the constitutional question may be so severed from the <em>Young</em> analysis.  The Court wields <em>Young </em>in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to vindicate important federal rights.  Perhaps this Court should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that may rest on unconstitutional foundations.  This concern is misplaced.  The canon of constitutional avoidance directs courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that preserves its validity, but the specter of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent question of jurisdiction.  Courts interpret and evaluate a statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate the case before them.  To decline to adjudicate a federal right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect to invalidate the right in the quest to save it.  The Court should not permit the commission of acts that violate a federal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted beyond its authority.  Because the suit must be assumed to vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available to the State under the program, it may proceed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963520">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nROBERTS, C.

This has never happened before.  In order to reach this unsettling result, the Court extends the fiction of <em>Ex parte Young</em>\xe2\x80\x94what we have called an \xe2\x80\x9cempty formalism\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94well beyond the circumstances of that case.  Because I cannot subscribe to such a substantial and novel expansion of what we have also called \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d to a State\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe federal system established by our Constitution preserves the sovereign status of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alden</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a>, 714 (1999).  As confirmed by the Eleventh Amendment, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n integral component of that residuary and inviolable sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d is the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity from private suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>South Carolina Ports Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/743/index.html">535 U.

Accordingly, any time a State is haled into federal court against its will, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dignity and respect afforded [that] State, which [sovereign] immunity is designed to protect, are placed in jeopardy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Idaho</em> v. <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe of Idaho</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/261/index.html">521 U.

The immunity does not turn on whether relief will be awarded; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Eleventh Amendment is concerned not only with the States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to withstand suit, but with their privilege not to be sued.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority</em> v. <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/139/index.html">506 U.

The sole one relevant here is the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/44/index.html">517 U. S. 44</a>, 76 (1996), established by our decision in <em>Ex parte Young</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/index.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908).  In <em>Ex parte Young</em>, the Court<em> </em>held that private litigants could seek an injunction in federal court against a state official, prohibiting him from enforcing a state law claimed to violate the Federal Constitution.  See <em>id.</em>, at 159\xe2\x80\x93168.  As we have often observed, <em>Ex parte Young</em> rests on the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Couer d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 270, that such a suit is not really against the State, but rather against an individual who has been \xe2\x80\x9cstripped of his official or representative character\xe2\x80\x9d because of his unlawful conduct, <em>Ex parte Young</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 159\xe2\x80\x93160.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While we have consistently acknowledged the important role <em>Ex parte Young</em> plays in \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[ing] the vindication of federal rights,\xe2\x80\x9d we have been cautious not to give that decision \xe2\x80\x9can expansive interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/89/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/89/index.html">465 U. S. 89</a>, 105, 102 (1984).  Indeed, the history of our <em>Ex parte Young</em> jurisprudence has largely been focused on ensuring that this narrow exception is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly construed,\xe2\x80\x9d 465 U. S., at 114, n. 25.  We have, for example, held that the fiction of <em>Ex parte Young</em> does not extend to suits where the plaintiff seeks retroactive relief, <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/651/index.html">415 U. S. 651</a>, 678 (1974); where the claimed violations are based on state law, <em>Pennhurst</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 106; where the federal law violation is no longer \xe2\x80\x9congoing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Mansour</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/64/index.html">474 U. S. 64</a>, 71 (1985); \xe2\x80\x9cwhere Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State\xe2\x80\x9d of the claimed federal right, <em>Seminole Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 74; and where \xe2\x80\x9cspecial sovereignty interests\xe2\x80\x9d are implicated, <em>Couer d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 281.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recently stated that when \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young</em> avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/635/index.html">535 U. S. 635</a>, 645 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But not every plaintiff who complies with these prerequisites will be able to bring suit under <em>Ex parte Young</em>.  Indeed, in <em>Verizon</em> itself the Court went beyond its so-called straightforward inquiry in considering whether <em>Ex parte Young</em> applied.  After deciding the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cclearly satisfie[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court went on to examine whether Congress had created a detailed remedial scheme like the one in <em>Seminole Tribe</em>.  535 U. S., at 645, 647\xe2\x80\x93648 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Only after determining that Congress had not done so did the Court conclude that the suit could go forward under <em>Ex parte Young</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If <em>Verizon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s formulation set forth the only requirements for bringing an action under <em>Ex parte Young</em>, two of our recent precedents were wrongly decided.  In <em>Seminole Tribe</em>, the Court acknowledged that it had often \xe2\x80\x9cfound federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to end a continuing violation of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 U. S., at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court held, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9csituation presented\xe2\x80\x9d there was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional <em>Ex parte Young</em> action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Couer d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em>, the Court recognized that an \xe2\x80\x9callegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the requested relief is prospective is <em>ordinarily</em> sufficient to invoke the <em>Young</em> fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U. S., at 281 (emphasis added).  The Court held, however, that the action could not proceed under <em>Ex parte Young</em> because it implicated \xe2\x80\x9cspecial sovereignty interests\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in that case, the State\xe2\x80\x99s property rights in certain submerged lands.  521 U. S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93283.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>Papasan</em> v. <em>Allain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/265/index.html">478 U. S. 265</a> (1986), there are \xe2\x80\x9ccertain types of cases that formally meet the <em>Young </em>requirements of a state official acting inconsistently with federal law but that stretch that case too far and would upset the balance of federal and state interests that it embodies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 277.  This is one of those cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In refusing to extend <em>Ex parte Young</em> to claims that involve \xe2\x80\x9cspecial sovereignty interests,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court in <em>Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene Tribe</em> warned against a rote application of the <em>Ex parte Young</em> fiction:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo interpret <em>Young</em> to permit a federal-court action to proceed in every case where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is sought against an officer, named in his individual capacity, would be to adhere to an empty formalism and to undermine the principle \xe2\x80\xa6 that Eleventh Amendment immunity represents a real limitation on a federal court\xe2\x80\x99s federal-question jurisdiction.  The real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to elementary mechanics of captions and pleading.  Application of the <em>Young</em> exception must reflect a proper understanding of its role in our federal system and respect for state courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U. S., at 270.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is undisputed that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law by a state official and seeks only prospective relief.  If this were a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional <em>Ex parte Young</em> action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Seminole Tribe</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 73, petitioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under that case.  This, however, is anything but a traditional case\xe2\x80\x94and petitioner is anything but a typical <em>Ex parte Young</em> plaintiff.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Ex parte Young</em>\xe2\x80\x94and, for that matter, unlike any other plaintiff that has ever sought to invoke <em>Ex parte Young</em> before this Court\xe2\x80\x94petitioner is a state agency seeking to sue officials of the same State in federal court.  The Court is troubled by this novelty, <em>ante</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, but not enough.  See <em>Free Enterprise Fund</em> v. <em>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</em>, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Alden</em>, 527 U. S., at 743\xe2\x80\x93745; <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a>, 905\xe2\x80\x93910, 918, 925 (1997).  This is especially true in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d we articulated more than 120 years ago in <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana</em>, that States are immune from suits that would have been \xe2\x80\x9canomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hans</em>, 134 U. S., at 18; see also <em>Alden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 727 (invoking presumption).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, when determining whether to lift the bar of sovereign immunity, we have \xe2\x80\x9cattribute[d] great significance\xe2\x80\x9d to the absence of analogous suits \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the founding or for many years thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Federal Maritime Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 535 U. S., at 755.  This sort of suit was not only anomalous and unheard of at the time of the founding; it was anomalous and unheard of yesterday.  The <em>Hans </em>presumption applies here with full force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court speculates that these suits have not previously arisen because the necessary conditions\xe2\x80\x94state agencies pursuing a federal right free of internal state veto\xe2\x80\x94are themselves novel.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12; see also <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Even if true, that simply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for mere rote application of <em>Ex parte Young</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to its novel character, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint \xe2\x80\x9cconflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst</em>, 465 U. S., at 106.  In <em>Alden</em>, we held that state sovereign immu-\nnity prohibited Congress from authorizing \xe2\x80\x9cprivate suits against nonconsenting States in their own courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 U. S., at 749.  We explained that such power would permit one branch of state government, the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s own courts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto coerce the other branches of the State\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto turn the State against itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state agency on one side, and state executive officials on the other.  The objection in <em>Alden</em> was that the Federal Government could force the State to defend itself before itself.  Here extending <em>Young</em> forces the State to defend itself <em>against</em> itself in federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Petitioner claims the title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Commonwealth of Virginia\xe2\x80\x9d in its complaint, App. 10; respondents are state officials acting in an official capacity.  Whatever the decision in the litigation, one thing is clear: The Commonwealth will win.  And the Commonwealth will lose.  Because of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, a federal judge will resolve which part of the Commonwealth will prevail. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal court; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that this intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.  This is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to guard against.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent\xe2\x80\x9d).  That indignity is compounded when the State is haled into federal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal state dispute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no sovereign interest in determining <em>where</em> such disputes will be resolved.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n. 6.  It is one thing for a State to decide that its components may sue one another in its own courts (as Virginia did here); it is quite another thing for such a dispute to be resolved in federal court against the State\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.  For this reason, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s examples of other suits pitting state entities against one another are inapposite.  In each of those hypotheticals, the State consented to having a particular forum resolve its internal conflict.  That is not true here.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial sovereignty interests\xe2\x80\x9d implicated here make this case \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional <em>Ex parte Young</em> action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Seminole Tribe</em>, 517 U. S., at 73.  I would cling to reality and not extend the fiction of <em>Ex parte Young</em> to cover petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suit.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court offers several justifications for its expansion of <em>Ex parte Young</em>.  None is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first contends that whether the <em>Ex parte Young</em> fiction should be applied turns only on the \xe2\x80\x9crelief sought\xe2\x80\x9d in a case.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court is correct that several of our prior cases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Edelman</em>, 415 U. S., at 664\xe2\x80\x93671.  That may well be because \xe2\x80\x9cthe difference between the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under <em>Ex parte Young</em> will not in many instances be that between day and night.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 667.  But the Court is wrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and categorically conclude that there can be no other basis for determining whether to extend <em>Ex parte Young</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The thrust of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument appears to be that, because the relief sought here is no different from that which could be sought in a suit by a private protection and advocacy system, the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young </em>should also apply to a suit brought by a state system.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.  But private entities are different from public ones: They are private.  When private litigants are involved, the State is not turned against itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante</em>, at 9, there is indeed a real difference between a suit against the State brought by a private party and one brought by a state agency.  It is the difference between eating and cannibalism; between murder and patricide.  While the ultimate results may be the same\xe2\x80\x94a full stomach and a dead body\xe2\x80\x94it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.  I would think it more an affront to someone\xe2\x80\x99s dignity to be sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger.  While neither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would be equally received.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also contends that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sue state officials in federal court \xe2\x80\x9cis a consequence of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s own decision to establish a public [protection and advocacy] system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This cannot mean that Virginia has consented to an infringement on its sovereignty.  That argument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek certiorari on that issue.  See <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Reinhard</em>, 565 F.\xc2\xa03d 110, 116\xe2\x80\x93118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead the Court claims that \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia has only itself to blame\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it could have chosen to establish a private entity instead. <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and n.\xc2\xa05; see also <em>ante</em>, at 3 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect that an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from challenge simply because a constitutional alternative is available.  And here the public and private systems are not interchangeable alternatives in any event.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question presented in this case.  Only <em>after</em> concluding that <em>Ex parte Young</em> applies to this arrangement\xe2\x80\x94that for the first time in history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in federal court\xe2\x80\x94can the Court suggest that Virginia knowingly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Virginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent litigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same \xe2\x80\x9cas any other litigant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But petitioner is not like any other litigant.  While it is true petitioner enjoys some independence from the State\xe2\x80\x99s executive branch, that does not mean petitioner is independent <em>from the State</em>.  As noted, petitioner certainly views itself as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Commonwealth of Virginia,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 10, and would presumably invoke sovereign immunity itself if sued.  As a matter of sovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how a State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among different state agencies or officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because petitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it may sue state officials in federal court.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d since it \xe2\x80\x9cwas Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the power to sue state officials\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is more to this case than merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the Attorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions cited by the Court say nothing about actions against the State in federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If independent litigating authority is all that it takes, then scores of state entities now \xe2\x80\x9csuddenly possess the authority to pursue <em>Ex parte Young </em>actions against other state officials\xe2\x80\x9d in federal court.  <em>Reinhard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 124.  There would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to such suits.  Given the number of state agencies across the country that enjoy independent litigating authority, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for State of Indiana et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici</em> <em>Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9313, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today could potentially lead to all sorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal state government disputes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there is also no reason to think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is limited to state <em>agency</em> plaintiffs.  According to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some level of independence could as a matter of federal law bring suit against other state officials in federal court.  Disputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet rooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No one questions the continued vitality or importance of the doctrine announced in <em>Ex parte Young</em>.  But <em>Ex parte Young</em> was about affording relief to a private party against unconstitutional state action.  It was not about resolving\na dispute between two different state actors.  That is a matter for the State to sort out, not a federal judge.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Chisholm</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 2 Dall. 419 (1793)\xe2\x80\x94permitting States to be sued by private parties in federal court\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccreated such a shock of surprise\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the country \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Principality of Monaco</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/313/index.html">292 U. S. 313</a>, 325 (1934).  It is fair to say that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will probably not trigger a similar response.  But however much their practical functions and prominence may have changed in the past 218 years, the States remain a vital element of our political structure.  Sovereign immunity ensures that States retain a stature commensurate with their role under the Constitution.  Allowing one part of the State to sue another in federal court, so that a federal judge decides an important dispute between state officials, undermines state sovereignty in\nan unprecedented and direct way.  The fiction of <em>Ex parte Young</em> should not be extended to permit so real an\nintrusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I believe the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel expansion of <em>Ex parte Young</em> is inconsistent with the federal system established by our Constitution, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>Ex parte Young</em> also rests on the \xe2\x80\x9cwell-recognized irony that an official\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional conduct constitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/89/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/89/index.html">465 U.

In short, <em>Seminole Tribe</em> makes clear that a plaintiff who files a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaint alleg[ing] an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Verizon</em>, 535 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  We have held that \xe2\x80\x9cit is inherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes cognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court of the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to the original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McKesson Corp.</em> v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla.

By contrast, there is nothing \xe2\x80\x9cinherent in the constitutional plan\xe2\x80\x9d that warrants lower federal courts handling intrastate disputes absent a State\xe2\x80\x99s consent.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
