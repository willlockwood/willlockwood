It is further set forth that after the complainant had been for many years in the use of the improvements so made, the city authorities removed the pavement and the structure underneath, filled in the excavation, put down a new and different hind of pavement, known as the "Schillinger pavement," and have since excluded the complainant from the use of the space underneath the pavement in connection with the building adjacent, and that great damage has resulted from these acts of the city authorities.</p>\n<p>It appears also from the original bill that the city authorities committed the alleged wrongs complained of on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 156 U.
