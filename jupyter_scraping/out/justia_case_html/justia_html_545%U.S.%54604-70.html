S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(a) diversity jurisdiction.  After the dealers won a jury verdict, the court certified the case for interlocutory review on the question whether it had properly exercised \xc2\xa71367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who had not met \xc2\xa71332(a)\xe2\x80\x99s minimum amount-in-controversy requirement.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld this extension of supplemental jurisdiction.  In No. 04\xe2\x80\x9379, a girl and her family sought damages from Star-Kist Foods, Inc., in a diversity action.  The District Court granted Star-Kist summary judgment, finding that none of the plaintiffs had met the amount-in-controversy requirement.  The First Circuit ruled that the girl, but not her family, had alleged the requisite amount, and then held that supplemental jurisdiction over the family\xe2\x80\x99s claims was improper because original jurisdiction is lacking in a diversity case if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies \xc2\xa71332(a)\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy requirement, \xc2\xa71367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the requisite amount.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Although district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, once a court has original jurisdiction over some claims in an action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims arising from the same case or controversy.  See <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Gibbs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/index.html">383 U. S. 715</a>.  This expansive interpretation does not apply to \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s complete diversity requirement, for incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, leaving nothing to which supplemental claims can adhere.  But other statutory prerequisites, including the federal-question and amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim.  Before \xc2\xa71367 was enacted, every plaintiff had to separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Paul Gray, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/583/index.html">306 U. S. 583</a>; <em>Zahn</em> v. <em>International Paper Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/index.html">414 U. S. 291</a>, and the grant of original jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties did not itself confer supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving other parties, <em>Finley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html">490 U. S. 545</a>, 556.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0All parties here agree that \xc2\xa71367 overturned <em>Finley,</em> but there is no warrant for assuming that is all it did.  To determine \xc2\xa71367\xe2\x80\x99s scope requires examination of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text in light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.  Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which district courts would have original jurisdiction.  Its last sentence makes clear that this grant extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties.  The question here is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some, but not all, plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71367(a).  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The answer must be yes.  When a well-pleaded complaint has at least one claim satisfying the amount-in-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim.  A court with original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint has original jurisdiction over a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71367(a), even if that action comprises fewer claims than were included in the complaint.  Once a court has original jurisdiction over the action, it can then decide whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over other claims in the action.  Section 1367(b), which contains exceptions to \xc2\xa71367(a)\xe2\x80\x99s broad rule, does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties here.  In fact, its exceptions support this Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court cannot accept the alternative view, or its supporting theories, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless it has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint.  The \xe2\x80\x9cindivisibility theory\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that all claims must stand or fall as a single, indivisible action\xe2\x80\x94is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental jurisdiction and is belied by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the offending parties instead of the entire action.  And the statute\xe2\x80\x99s broad and general language does not permit the theory to apply in diversity cases when it does not apply in federal-question cases.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccontamination theory\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction contaminates every other claim in the complaint\xe2\x80\x94makes sense with respect to the complete diversity requirement because a nondiverse party\xe2\x80\x99s presence eliminates the justification for a federal forum.  But it makes little sense with regard to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention.  It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition that \xc2\xa71332 imposes both requirements, that the contamination theory germane to the former also applies to the latter.  This Court has already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the closely analogous removal-jurisdiction context.  See <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>International College of Surgeons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/156/index.html">522 U. S. 156</a>.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0In light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure, \xc2\xa71367\xe2\x80\x99s only plausible reading is that a court has original jurisdiction over a civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect.  Though a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim in a lawsuit, contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional defects going only to the substantive importance of individual claims.  Thus, \xc2\xa71367(a)\xe2\x80\x99s threshold requirement is satisfied in cases, such as these, where some but not all of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy.  Section 1367 by its plain text overruled <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em> and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same case or controversy, subject only to enumerated exceptions not applicable here.<font b="1">  P.\xc2\xa019.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(f)\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa71367 is not ambiguous, this Court need not examine other interpretative tools, including legislative history.

Our decision turns on the correct interpretation of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367.  The question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, \xc2\xa71367 does authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the jurisdictional amount specified in the statute setting forth the requirements for diversity jurisdiction.  We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9370, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9379.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers filed a class-action suit against the Exxon Corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida.  The dealers alleged an intentional and systematic scheme by Exxon under which they were overcharged for fuel purchased from Exxon.  The plaintiffs invoked the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71332(a) diversity jurisdiction.  After a unanimous jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Court certified the case for interlocutory review, asking whether it had properly exercised \xc2\xa71367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s extension of supplemental jurisdiction to these class members. <em> Allapattah Services, Inc.</em> v. <em>Exxon Corp.</em>, 333 F.\xc2\xa03d 1248 (2003).  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e find,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held, \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xc2\xa71367 clearly and unambiguously provides district courts with the authority in diversity class actions to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy as long as the district court has original jurisdiction over the claims of at least one of the class representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1256.  This decision accords with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits.  See<em> Rosmer</em> v. <em>Pfizer, Inc.</em>, 263 F.\xc2\xa03d 110 (CA4 2001); <em>Olden</em> v. <em>LaFarge Corp.</em>, 383 F.\xc2\xa03d 495 (CA6 2004);<em> Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</em> v. <em>Press Mechanical, Inc.</em>, 77 F.\xc2\xa03d 928 (CA7 1996); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation</em>, 123 F.\xc2\xa03d 599 (CA7 1997).  The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, adopting a similar analysis of the statute, have held that in a diversity class action the unnamed class members need not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the named class members do.  These decisions, however, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs must satisfy this requirement.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Abbott Labs.</em>, 51 F.\xc2\xa03d 524 (CA5 1995);<em> Gibson</em> v. <em>Chrysler Corp.</em>, 261 F.\xc2\xa03d 927 (CA9 2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit took a different position on the meaning of \xc2\xa71367(a).  370 F.\xc2\xa03d 124 (2004).  In that case, a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking damages for unusually severe injuries she received when she sliced her finger on a tuna can.  Her family joined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional distress and certain medical expenses.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the plaintiffs met the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, however, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family members, had made allegations of damages in the requisite amount.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light of the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims was proper under \xc2\xa71367.  The court held that \xc2\xa71367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only when the district court has original jurisdiction over the action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdiction is lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  Although the Court of Appeals claimed to \xe2\x80\x9cexpress no view\xe2\x80\x9d on whether the result would be the same in a class action, <em>id</em>., at 143, n.\xc2\xa019, its analysis is inconsistent with that of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view of \xc2\xa71367 is, however, shared by the Courts of Appeal for the Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and the latter two Courts of Appeals have expressly applied this rule to class actions.  See<em> Meritcare, Inc.</em> v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.</em>, 166 F.\xc2\xa03d 214 (CA3 1999); <em>Trimble</em> v. <em>Asarco, Inc.</em>, 232 F.\xc2\xa03d 946 (CA8 2000); <em>Leonhardt</em> v. <em>Western Sugar Co.</em>, 160 F.\xc2\xa03d 631 (CA10 1998).  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The district courts of the United States, as we have said many times, are \xe2\x80\x9ccourts of limited jurisdiction.  They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kokkonen</em> v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/375/index.html">511 U. S. 375</a>, 377 (1994).  In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original jurisdiction in federal-question cases\xe2\x80\x94civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U. S. citizens and foreign citizens, or by foreign states against U. S. citizens.  \xc2\xa71332.  To ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, \xc2\xa71332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount, currently $75,000.  \xc2\xa71332(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, it is well established\xe2\x80\x94in certain classes of cases\xe2\x80\x94that, once a court has original jurisdiction over some claims in the action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims that are part of the same case or controversy.  The leading modern case for this principle is <em>Mine Workers</em> v. <em>Gibbs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/index.html">383 U. S. 715</a> (1966).  In <em>Gibbs</em>, the plaintiff alleged the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated both federal and state law.  The District Court, <em>Gibbs</em> held, had original jurisdiction over the action based on the federal claims.  <em>Gibbs</em> confirmed that the District Court had the additional power (though not the obligation) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state claims that arose from the same Article III case or controversy.  <em>Id</em>., at 725 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [A]ssuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is <em>power</em> in federal courts to hear the whole\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we later noted, the decision allowing jurisdiction over pendent state claims in <em>Gibbs</em> did not mention, let alone come to grips with, the text of the jurisdictional statutes and the bedrock principle that federal courts have no jurisdiction without statutory authorization.  <em>Finley</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/545/index.html">490 U. S. 545</a>, 548 (1989).  In <em>Finley</em>, we nonetheless reaffirmed and rationalized <em>Gibbs</em> and its progeny by inferring from it the interpretive principle that, in cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims between parties properly in federal court, the jurisdictional statutes should be read broadly, on the assumption that in this context Congress intended to authorize courts to exercise their full Article III power to dispose of an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98entire action before the court [which] comprises but one constitutional \xe2\x80\x9ccase.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U. S., at 549 (quoting <em>Gibbs</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 725).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have not, however, applied <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes.  For instance, we have consistently interpreted \xc2\xa71332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action.  <em>Strawbridge</em> v. <em>Curtiss,</em> 3 Cranch 267 (1806); <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</em> v. <em>Kroger,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/index.html">437 U. S. 365</a>, 375 (1978).  The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution, <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Tashire,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/523/index.html">386 U. S. 523</a>, 530\xe2\x80\x93531 (1967), or by the plain text of \xc2\xa71332(a).  The Court, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be perceived as favoring, home-state litigants.  The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for conferring \xc2\xa71332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action.  See <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Schacht, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/381/index.html">524 U. S. 381</a>, 389 (1998); <em>Newman-Green, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alfonzo-Larrain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/826/index.html">490 U. S. 826</a>, 829 (1989).  The specific purpose of the complete diversity rule explains both why we have not adopted <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 expansive interpretive approach to this aspect of the jurisdictional statute and why <em>Gibbs</em> does not undermine the complete diversity rule.  In order for a federal court to invoke supplemental jurisdiction under <em>Gibbs</em>, it must first have original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the action.  Incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, so there is nothing to which supplemental jurisdiction can adhere.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the other statutory prerequisites for federal jurisdiction, including the federal-question and amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim.  True, it does not follow by necessity from this that a district court has authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all claims provided there is original jurisdiction over just one.  Before the enactment of \xc2\xa71367, the Court declined in contexts other than the pendent-claim instance to follow <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 expansive approach to interpretation of the jurisdictional statutes.  The Court took a more restrictive view of the proper interpretation of these statutes in so-called pendent-party cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving additional parties\xe2\x80\x94plaintiffs or defendants\xe2\x80\x94where the district courts would lack original jurisdiction over claims by each of the parties standing alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, with respect to plaintiff-specific jurisdictional requirements, the Court held in <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Paul Gray, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/583/index.html">306 U. S. 583</a> (1939), that every plaintiff must separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  Though <em>Clark</em> was a federal-question case, at that time federal-question jurisdiction had an amount-in-controversy requirement analogous to the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity cases.  \xe2\x80\x9cProper practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Clark</em> held, \xe2\x80\x9crequires that where each of several plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own claim, the suit should be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is involved.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id</em>., at 590.  The Court reaffirmed this rule, in the context of a class action brought invoking \xc2\xa71332(a) diversity jurisdiction, in <em>Zahn</em> v. <em>International Paper Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/291/index.html">414 U. S. 291</a> (1973).  It follows \xe2\x80\x9cinescapably\xe2\x80\x9d from <em>Clark</em>, the Court held in <em>Zahn</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cany plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\xe2\x80\x9d 414 U. S., at 300.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court took a similar approach with respect to supplemental jurisdiction over claims against additional defendants that fall outside the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 original jurisdiction.  In <em>Aldinger</em> v. <em>Howard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/1/index.html">427 U. S. 1</a> (1976), the plaintiff brought a 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 action against county officials in district court pursuant to the statutory grant of jurisdiction in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343(3) (1976 ed.).  The plaintiff further alleged the court had supplemental jurisdiction over her related state-law claims against the county, even though the county was not suable under \xc2\xa71983 and so was not subject to \xc2\xa71343(3)\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction.  The Court held that supplemental jurisdiction could not be exercised because Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa71343(3), had declined (albeit implicitly) to extend federal jurisdiction over any party who could not be sued under the federal civil rights statutes.  427 U. S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9319.  \xe2\x80\x9cBefore it can be concluded that [supplemental] jurisdiction [over additional parties] exists,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Aldinger</em> held, \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle]\xc2\xa0III permits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated its existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Finley</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/545/index.html">490 U. S. 545</a> (1989), we confronted a similar issue in a different statutory context.  The plaintiff in <em>Finley</em> brought a Federal Tort Claims Act negligence suit against the Federal Aviation Administration in District Court, which had original jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71346(b).  The plaintiff tried to add related claims against other defendants, invoking the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s supplemental jurisdiction over so-called pendent parties.  We held that the District Court lacked a sufficient statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.  Relying primarily on <em>Zahn</em>, <em>Aldinger</em>, and <em>Kroger</em>, we held in <em>Finley</em> that \xe2\x80\x9ca grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 U. S., at 556.  While <em>Finley</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9climit or impair\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gibbs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 liberal approach to interpreting the jurisdictional statutes in the context of supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving the same parties, 490 U. S., at 556, <em>Finley</em> nevertheless declined to extend that interpretive assumption to claims involving additional parties.  <em>Finley</em> held that in the context of parties, in contrast to claims, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not assume that the full constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read jurisdictional statutes broadly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 549.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the jurisdictional statutes existed in 1989, then, here is how matters stood: First, the diversity requirement in \xc2\xa71332(a) required complete diversity; absent complete diversity, the district court lacked original jurisdiction over all of the claims in the action.  <em>Strawbridge</em>, 3 Cranch, at 267\xe2\x80\x93268; <em>Kroger</em>, 437 U. S., at 373\xe2\x80\x93374.  Second, if the district court had original jurisdiction over at least one claim, the jurisdictional statutes implicitly authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims between the same parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy.  <em>Gibbs</em>, 383 U. S., at 725.  Third, even when the district court had original jurisdiction over one or more claims between particular parties, the jurisdictional statutes did not authorize supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving other parties.  <em>Clark</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 590; <em>Zahn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 300\xe2\x80\x93301; <em>Finley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 556.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Finley</em> we emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d 490 U. S., at 556.  In 1990, Congress accepted the invitation.  It passed the Judicial Improvements Act, 104 Stat. 5089, which enacted \xc2\xa71367, the provision which controls these cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.  Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All parties to this litigation and all courts to consider the question agree that \xc2\xa71367 overturned the result in <em>Finley</em>.  There is no warrant, however, for assuming that \xc2\xa71367 did no more than to overrule <em>Finley</em> and otherwise to codify the existing state of the law of supplemental jurisdiction.  We must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation than their text warrants, 490 U. S., at 549, 556; but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what the text provides.  No sound canon of interpretation requires Congress to speak with extraordinary clarity in order to modify the rules of federal jurisdiction within appropriate constitutional bounds.   Ordinary principles of statutory construction apply.  In order to determine the scope of supplemental jurisdiction authorized by \xc2\xa71367, then, we must examine the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text in light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which the district courts would have original jurisdiction.  The last sentence of \xc2\xa71367(a) makes it clear that the grant of supplemental jurisdiction extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties.  The single question before us, therefore, is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, but the claims of others plaintiffs do not, presents a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the answer is yes, \xc2\xa71367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over all claims, including those that do not independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, if the claims are part of the same Article III case or controversy.  If the answer is no, \xc2\xa71367(a) is inapplicable and, in light of our holdings in <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em>, the district court has no statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the additional claims.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now conclude the answer must be yes.  When the well-pleaded complaint contains at least one claim that satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim.  The presence of other claims in the complaint, over which the district court may lack original jurisdiction, is of no moment.  If the court has original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint, it has original jurisdiction over a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71367(a), even if the civil action over which it has jurisdiction comprises fewer claims than were included in the complaint.  Once the court determines it has original jurisdiction over the civil action, it can turn to the question whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims in the action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367(a) commences with the direction that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71367(b) and (c), or other relevant statutes, may provide specific exceptions, but otherwise \xc2\xa71367(a) is a broad jurisdictional grant, with no distinction drawn between pendent-claim and pendent-party cases.  In fact, the last sentence of \xc2\xa71367(a) makes clear that the provision grants supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties. The terms of \xc2\xa71367 do not acknowledge any distinction between pendent jurisdiction and the doctrine of so-called ancillary jurisdiction.  Though the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction developed separately as a historical matter, the Court has recognized that the doctrines are \xe2\x80\x9ctwo species of the same generic problem,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kroger</em>, 437 U. S., at 370.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71367 indicates a congressional intent to recognize, preserve, or create some meaningful, substantive distinction between the jurisdictional categories we have historically labeled pendent and ancillary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If \xc2\xa71367(a) were the sum total of the relevant statutory language, our holding would rest on that language alone.  The statute, of course, instructs us to examine \xc2\xa71367(b) to determine if any of its exceptions apply, so we proceed to that section.  While \xc2\xa71367(b) qualifies the broad rule of \xc2\xa71367(a), it does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue here.  The specific exceptions to \xc2\xa71367(a) contained in \xc2\xa71367(b), moreover, provide additional support for our conclusion that \xc2\xa71367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.  Section 1367(b), which applies only to diversity cases, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to intervene pursuant to Rule 24.  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa71367(b), however, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9379) or certified as class-action members pursuant to Rule 23 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9370).  The natural, indeed the necessary, inference is that \xc2\xa71367 confers supplemental jurisdiction over claims by Rule 20 and Rule 23 plaintiffs.  This inference, at least with respect to Rule 20 plaintiffs, is strengthened by the fact that \xc2\xa71367(b) explicitly excludes supplemental jurisdiction over claims against defendants joined under Rule 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot accept the view, urged by some of the parties, commentators, and Courts of Appeals, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless the court has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint.  As we understand this position, it requires assuming either that all claims in the complaint must stand or fall as a single, indivisible \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of definitional necessity\xe2\x80\x94what we will refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cindivisibility theory\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or else that the inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction somehow contaminates every other claim in the complaint, depriving the court of original jurisdiction over any of these claims\xe2\x80\x94what we will refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9ccontamination theory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indivisibility theory is easily dismissed, as it is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental jurisdiction.  If a district court must have original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint in order to have \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action,\xe2\x80\x9d then in <em>Gibbs</em> there was no civil action of which the district court could assume original jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71331, and so no basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over any of the claims.  The indivisibility theory is further belied by our practice\xe2\x80\x94in both federal-question and diversity cases\xe2\x80\x94of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the offending parties rather than dismissing the entire action.  <em>Clark</em>, for example, makes clear that claims that are jurisdictionally defective as to amount in controversy do not destroy original jurisdiction over other claims.  306 U. S., at 590 (dismissing parties who failed to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement but retaining jurisdiction over the remaining party).  If the presence of jurisdictionally problematic claims in the complaint meant the district court was without original jurisdiction over the single, indivisible civil action before it, then the district court would have to dismiss the whole action rather than particular parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also find it unconvincing to say that the definitional indivisibility theory applies in the context of diversity cases but not in the context of federal-question cases.  The broad and general language of the statute does not permit this result.  The contention is premised on the notion that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions\xe2\x80\x9d means different things in \xc2\xa71331 and \xc2\xa71332.  It is implausible, however, to say that the identical phrase means one thing (original jurisdiction in all actions where at least one claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \xc2\xa71331 and something else (original jurisdiction in all actions where every claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \xc2\xa71332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contamination theory, as we have noted, can make some sense in the special context of the complete diversity requirement because the presence of nondiverse parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for providing a federal forum.  The theory, however, makes little sense with respect to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention.  The presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate the fear of bias with respect to all claims, but the presence of a claim that falls short of the minimum amount in controversy does nothing to reduce the importance of the claims that do meet this requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition that \xc2\xa71332 imposes both the diversity requirement and<em> </em>the amount-in-controversy requirement, that the contamination theory germane to the former is also relevant to the latter.  There is no inherent logical connection between the amount-in-controversy requirement and \xc2\xa71332 diversity jurisdiction.  After all, federal-question jurisdiction once had an amount-in-controversy requirement as well.  If such a requirement were revived under \xc2\xa71331, it is clear beyond peradventure that \xc2\xa71367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over federal-question cases where some, but not all, of the federal-law claims involve a sufficient amount in controversy.  In other words, \xc2\xa71367(a) unambiguously overrules the holding and the result in <em>Clark</em>.  If that is so, however, it would be quite extraordinary to say that \xc2\xa71367 did not also overrule <em>Zahn</em>, a case that was premised in substantial part on the holding in <em>Clark</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the theoretical difficulties with the argument that a district court has original jurisdiction over a civil action only if it has original jurisdiction over each individual claim in the complaint, we have already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the closely analogous context of removal jurisdiction.  In <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>International College of Surgeons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/156/index.html">522 U. S. 156</a> (1997), the plaintiff brought federal- and state-law claims in state court.  The defendant removed to federal court.  The plaintiff objected to removal, citing the text of the removal statute, \xc2\xa71441(a).  That statutory provision, which bears a striking similarity to the relevant portion of \xc2\xa71367, authorizes removal of \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action \xe2\x80\xa6 of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  The <em>College of Surgeons</em> plaintiff urged that, because its state-law claims were not within the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction, \xc2\xa71441(a) did not authorize removal.  We disagreed.  The federal law claims, we held, \xe2\x80\x9csuffice to make the actions \xe2\x80\x98civil actions\xe2\x80\x99 within the \xe2\x80\x98original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 of the district courts \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Nothing in the jurisdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] complaints, by virtue of their federal claims, were \xe2\x80\x98civil actions\xe2\x80\x99 within the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id</em>., at 166.  Once the case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction over the federal law claims and supplemental jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71367(a) over the state-law claims.  <em>Id</em>., at 165.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent in <em>College of Surgeons</em> argued that because the plaintiff sought on-the-record review of a local administrative agency decision, the review it sought was outside the scope of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  <em>Id</em>., at 177 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  We rejected both the suggestion that state-law claims involving administrative appeals are beyond the scope of \xc2\xa71367 supplemental jurisdiction, <em>id</em>., at 168\xe2\x80\x93172 (opinion of the Court), and the claim that the administrative review posture of the case deprived the District Court of original jurisdiction over the federal-law claims in the case, <em>id</em>., at 163\xe2\x80\x93168.  More importantly for present purposes, <em>College of Surgeons</em> stressed that a district court has original jurisdiction of a civil action for purposes of \xc2\xa71441(a) as long as it has original jurisdiction over a subset of the claims constituting the action.  Even the <em>College of Surgeons</em> dissent, which took issue with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71367, did not appear to contest this view of \xc2\xa71441(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>College of Surgeons</em> involved additional claims between the same parties, its interpretation of \xc2\xa71441(a) applies equally to cases involving additional parties whose claims fall short of the jurisdictional amount.  If we were to adopt the contrary view that the presence of additional parties means there is no \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action \xe2\x80\xa6 of which the district courts \xe2\x80\xa6 have original jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d those cases simply would not be removable.  To our knowledge, no court has issued a reasoned opinion adopting this view of the removal statute.  It is settled, of course, that absent complete diversity a case is not removable because the district court would lack original jurisdiction.  <em>Caterpillar Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/61/index.html">519 U. S. 61</a>, 73 (1996).  This, however, is altogether consistent with our view of \xc2\xa71441(a).  A failure of complete diversity, unlike the failure of some claims to meet the requisite amount in controversy, contaminates every claim in the action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also reject the argument, similar to the attempted distinction of <em>College of Surgeons</em> discussed above, that while the presence of additional claims over which the district court lacks jurisdiction does not mean the civil action is outside the purview of \xc2\xa71367(a), the presence of additional parties does.  The basis for this distinction is not altogether clear, and it is in considerable tension with statutory text.  Section 1367(a) applies by its terms to any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, and the last sentence of \xc2\xa71367(a) expressly contemplates that the court may have supplemental jurisdiction over additional parties.  So it cannot be the case that the presence of those parties destroys the court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction, within the meaning of \xc2\xa71367(a), over a civil action otherwise properly before it.  Also, \xc2\xa71367(b) expressly withholds supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases over claims by plaintiffs joined as indispensable parties under Rule 19.  If joinder of such parties were sufficient to deprive the district court of original jurisdiction over the civil action within the meaning of \xc2\xa71367(a), this specific limitation on supplemental jurisdiction in \xc2\xa71367(b) would be superfluous.  The argument that the presence of additional parties removes the civil action from the scope of \xc2\xa71367(a) also<font b="1"> would mean that \xc2\xa71367 left the <em>Finley</em> result undisturbed.  <em>Finley</em>, after all, involved a Federal Tort Claims Act suit against a federal defendant and state-law claims against additional defendants not otherwise subject to federal jurisdiction.  Yet all concede that one purpose of \xc2\xa71367 was to change the result reached in <em>Finley</em>.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it is suggested that our interpretation of \xc2\xa71367(a) creates an anomaly regarding the exceptions listed in \xc2\xa71367(b): It is not immediately obvious why Congress would withhold supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs joined as parties \xe2\x80\x9cneeded for just adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d under Rule 19 but would allow supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20.  The omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of exceptions in \xc2\xa71367(b) may have been an \xe2\x80\x9cunintentional drafting gap,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Meritcare</em>, 166 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221 and n.\xc2\xa06.  If that is the case, it is up to Congress rather than the courts to fix it.  The omission may seem odd, but it is not absurd.  An alternative explanation for the different treatment of Rule 19 and Rule 20 is that Congress was concerned that extending supplemental jurisdiction to Rule 19 plaintiffs would allow circumvention of the complete diversity rule: A nondiverse plaintiff might be omitted intentionally from the original action, but joined later under Rule 19 as a necessary party.  See <em>Stromberg Metal Works</em>, 77 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 932.  The contamination theory described above, if applicable, means this ruse would fail, but Congress may have wanted to make assurance double sure.  More generally, Congress may have concluded that federal jurisdiction is only appropriate if the district court would have original jurisdiction over the claims of all those plaintiffs who are so essential to the action that they could be joined under Rule 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of \xc2\xa71367(b) exceptions is anomalous, moreover, it is no more anomalous than the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in that list would be if the alternative view of \xc2\xa71367(a) were to prevail.  If the district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil diversity action where any plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims fail to comply with all the requirements of \xc2\xa71332, there is no need for a special \xc2\xa71367(b) exception for Rule 19 plaintiffs who do not meet these requirements.  Though the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from \xc2\xa71367(b) presents something of a puzzle on our view of the statute, the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in this section is at least as difficult to explain under the alternative view.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so we circle back to the original question.  When the well-pleaded complaint in district court includes multiple claims, all part of the same case or controversy, and some, but not all, of the claims are within the court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction, does the court have before it \xe2\x80\x9cany civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d?  It does.  Under \xc2\xa71367, the court has original jurisdiction over the civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect.  No other reading of \xc2\xa71367 is plausible in light of the text and structure of the jurisdictional statute.  Though the special nature and purpose of the diversity requirement mean that a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim in the lawsuit, the contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional defects that go only to the substantive importance of individual claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It follows from this conclusion that the threshold requirement of \xc2\xa71367(a) is satisfied in cases, like those now before us, where some, but not all, of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy.  We hold that \xc2\xa71367 by its plain text overruled <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em> and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy, subject only to enumerated exceptions not applicable in the cases now before us.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proponents of the alternative view of \xc2\xa71367 insist that the statute is at least ambiguous and that we should look to other interpretive tools, including the legislative history of \xc2\xa71367, which supposedly demonstrate Congress did not intend \xc2\xa71367 to overrule <em>Zahn</em>.  We can reject this argument at the very outset simply because \xc2\xa71367 is not ambiguous.  For the reasons elaborated above, interpreting \xc2\xa71367 to foreclose supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs in diversity cases who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy is inconsistent with the text, read in light of other statutory provisions and our established jurisprudence.  Even if we were to stipulate, however, that the reading these proponents urge upon us is textually plausible, the legislative history cited to support it would not alter our view as to the best interpretation of \xc2\xa71367.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those who urge that the legislative history refutes our interpretation rely primarily on the House Judiciary Committee Report on the Judicial Improvements Act.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 101\xe2\x80\x93734 (1990) (House Report or Report).  This Report explained that \xc2\xa71367 would \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize jurisdiction in a case like <em>Finley</em>, as well as essentially restore the pre-<em>Finley</em> understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  House Report, at 28.  The Report stated that \xc2\xa71367(a) \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally authorizes the district court to exercise jurisdiction over a supplemental claim whenever it forms part of the same constitutional case or controversy as the claim or claims that provide the basis of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d and in so doing codifies <em>Gibbs</em> and fills the statutory gap recognized in <em>Finley</em>.  House Report, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329, and n.\xc2\xa015.  The Report then remarked that \xc2\xa71367(b) \xe2\x80\x9cis not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of [\xc2\xa71332] in diversity-only class actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to <em>Finley</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d citing, without further elaboration, <em>Zahn</em> and<em> Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</em> v. <em>Cauble,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/255/356/index.html">255 U. S. 356</a> (1921).  House Report, at 29, and n.\xc2\xa017.  The Report noted that the \xe2\x80\x9cnet effect\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa71367(b) was to implement the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal rationale\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Kroger</em>, House Report, at 29, and n.\xc2\xa016, effecting only \xe2\x80\x9cone small change\xe2\x80\x9d in pre-<em>Finley</em> practice with respect to diversity actions: \xc2\xa71367(b) would exclude \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\xe2\x80\x9d House Report, at 29.  (It is evident that the report here meant to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have repeatedly held, the authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history or any other extrinsic material.  Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.  Not all extrinsic materials are reliable sources of insight into legislative understandings, however, and legislative history in particular is vulnerable to two serious criticisms.  First, legislative history is itself often murky, ambiguous, and contradictory.  Judicial investigation of legislative history has a tendency to become, to borrow Judge Leventhal\xe2\x80\x99s memorable phrase, an exercise in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98looking over a crowd and picking out your friends.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See<em> </em>Wald, Some Observations on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Court Term, 68 Iowa L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 195, 214 (1983).  Second, judicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports, which are not themselves subject to the requirements of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee members\xe2\x80\x94or, worse yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists\xe2\x80\x94both the power and the incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text.  We need not comment here on whether these problems are sufficiently prevalent to render legislative history inherently unreliable in all circumstances, a point on which Members of this Court have disagreed.  It is clear, however, that in this instance both criticisms are right on the mark.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First of all, the legislative history of \xc2\xa71367 is far murkier than selective quotation from the House Report would suggest.  The text of \xc2\xa71367 is based substantially on a draft proposal contained in a Federal Court Study Committee working paper, which was drafted by a Subcommittee chaired by Judge Posner.  Report of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship to the States 567\xe2\x80\x93568 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in Judicial Conference of the United States, 1 Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1, 1990).  See also Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 47\xe2\x80\x9348 (Apr. 2, 1990) (Study Committee Report) (echoing, in brief summary form, the Subcommittee Working Paper proposal and noting that the Subcommittee Working Paper \xe2\x80\x9ccontains additional material on this subject\xe2\x80\x9d); House Report, at 27 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Section 1367] implements a recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee found on pages 47 and 48 of its report\xe2\x80\x9d).  While the Subcommittee explained, in language echoed by the House Report, that its proposal \xe2\x80\x9cbasically restores the law as it existed prior to <em>Finley</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, it observed in a footnote that its proposal would overrule <em>Zahn</em> and that this would be a good idea, Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, n. 33.  Although the Federal Courts Study Committee did not expressly adopt the Subcommittee\xe2\x80\x99s specific reference to <em>Zahn</em>, it neither explicitly disagreed with the Subcommittee\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this was the best reading of the proposed text nor substantially modified the proposal to avoid this result.  Study Committee Report, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  Therefore, even if the House Report could fairly be read to reflect an understanding that the text of \xc2\xa71367 did not overrule <em>Zahn</em>, the Subcommittee Working Paper on which \xc2\xa71367 was based reflected the opposite understanding.  The House Report is no more authoritative than the Subcommittee Working Paper.  The utility of either can extend no further than the light it sheds on how the enacting Legislature understood the statutory text.  Trying to figure out how to square the Subcommittee Working Paper\xe2\x80\x99s understanding with the House Report\xe2\x80\x99s understanding, or which is more reflective of the understanding of the enacting legislators, is a hopeless task.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the worst fears of critics who argue legislative history will be used to circumvent the Article I process were realized in this case.  The telltale evidence is the statement, by three law professors who participated in drafting \xc2\xa71367, see House Report, at 27, n.\xc2\xa013, that \xc2\xa71367 \xe2\x80\x9con its face\xe2\x80\x9d permits \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental jurisdiction over claims of class members that do not satisfy section 1332\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional amount requirement, which would overrule <em>[Zahn]</em>.  [There is] a disclaimer of intent to accomplish this result in the legislative history\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. It would have been better had the statute dealt explicitly with this problem, and the legislative history was an attempt to correct the oversight.\xe2\x80\x9d Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L.\xc2\xa0J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).  The professors were frank to concede that if one refuses to consider the legislative history, one has no choice but to \xe2\x80\x9cconclude that section 1367 has wiped <em>Zahn</em> off the books.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid</em>.  So there exists an acknowledgment, by parties who have detailed, specific knowledge of the statute and the drafting process, both that the plain text of \xc2\xa71367 overruled <em>Zahn</em> and that language to the contrary in the House Report was a <em>post hoc</em> attempt to alter that result.  One need not subscribe to the wholesale condemnation of legislative history to refuse to give any effect to such a deliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, even if we believed resort to legislative history were appropriate in these cases\xe2\x80\x94a point we do not concede\xe2\x80\x94we would not give significant weight to the House Report.  The distinguished jurists who drafted the Subcommittee Working Paper, along with three of the participants in the drafting of \xc2\xa71367, agree that this provision, on its face, overrules <em>Zahn</em>.  This accords with the best reading of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, and nothing in the legislative history indicates directly and explicitly that Congress understood the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude cases in which some but not all of the diversity plaintiffs meet the amount in controversy requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No credence, moreover, can be given to the claim that, if Congress understood \xc2\xa71367 to overrule <em>Zahn</em>, the proposal would have been more controversial.  We have little sense whether any Member of Congress would have been particularly upset by this result.  This is not a case where one can plausibly say that concerned legislators might not have realized the possible effect of the text they were adopting.  Certainly, any competent legislative aide who studied the matter would have flagged this issue if it were a matter of importance to his or her boss, especially in light of the Subcommittee Working Paper.  There are any number of reasons why legislators did not spend more time arguing over \xc2\xa71367, none of which are relevant to our interpretation of what the words of the statute mean.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we note that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109\xe2\x80\x932, 119 Stat. 4, enacted this year, has no bearing on our analysis of these cases.  Subject to certain limitations, the CAFA confers federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions where the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.  It abrogates the rule against aggregating claims, a rule this Court recognized in <em>Ben-Hur</em> and reaffirmed in <em>Zahn</em>.  The CAFA, however, is not retroactive, and the views of the 2005 Congress are not relevant to our interpretation of a text enacted by Congress in 1990.  The CAFA, moreover, does not moot the significance of our interpretation of \xc2\xa71367, as many proposed exercises of supplemental jurisdiction, even in the class-action context, might not fall within the CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  The CAFA, then, has no impact, one way or the other, on our interpretation of \xc2\xa71367.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.

It is helpful to consider in full the relevant portion of the House Report, which was also adopted by the Senate:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThis section would authorize jurisdiction in a case like <em>Finley</em> [v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/545/index.html"></a><a href="/us/490/545/index.html">490 U. S. 545</a> (1989)], as well as essentially restore the pre-<em>Finley </em>understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.  In federal question cases, it broadly authorizes the district courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims, including claims involving the joinder of additional parties.  In diversity cases, the district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction, except when doing so would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of the diversity statute.</p>\n<p align="left">.....</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSubsection 114(b) [\xc2\xa71367(b)] prohibits a district court in a case over which it has jurisdiction founded solely on the general diversity provision, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332, from exercising supplemental jurisdiction in specified circumstances.  [Footnote 16: \xe2\x80\x98The net effect of subsection (b) is to implement the principal rationale of <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</em> v. <em>Kroger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/365/index.html">437 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332 by the simple expedient of naming initially only those defendants whose joinder satisfies section 1332\xe2\x80\x99s requirements and later adding claims not within original federal jurisdiction against other defendants who have intervened or been joined on a supplemental basis.  In accord with case law, the subsection also prohibits the joinder or intervention of persons a plaintiffs if adding them is inconsistent with section 1332\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  The section is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332 in diversity-only class actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to Finley.

In addition to overturning that unfortunate and much-criticized decision,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the statute, according to the Report, codifies and preserves the \xe2\x80\x9cthe pre-<em>Finley </em>understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d House Report, at 28, with the exception of making \xe2\x80\x9cone small change in pre-<em>Finley</em> practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 29, which is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sweeping purpose that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision imputes to Congress bears no resemblance to the House Report\xe2\x80\x99s description of the statute.  But this does not seem to trouble the Court, for its decision today treats statutory interpretation as a pedantic exercise, divorced from any serious attempt at ascertaining congressional intent.  Of course, there are situations in which we do not honor Congress\xe2\x80\x99 apparent intent unless that intent is made \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d in the text of a statute\xe2\x80\x94in this way, we can be certain that Congress considered the issue and intended a disfavored outcome, see, <em>e.g., Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/244/index.html">511 U. S. 244</a> (1994) (requiring clear statement for retroactive civil legislation).  But that principle provides no basis for discounting the House Report, given that our cases have never recognized a presumption in <em>favor </em>of expansive diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for ignoring this virtual billboard of congressional intent are unpersuasive.  That a subcommittee of the Federal Courts Study Committee believed that an earlier, substantially similar version of the statute overruled <em>Zahn, </em>see <em>ante</em>, at 22,<em> </em>only highlights the fact that the statute is ambiguous.  What is determinative is that the House Report explicitly rejected that broad reading of the statutory text.  Such a report has special significance as an indicator of legislative intent.  In Congress, committee reports are normally considered the authoritative explication of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and purposes, and busy legislators and their assistants rely on that explication in casting their votes.  Cf. <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/70/index.html">469 U. S. 70</a>, 76 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which \xe2\x80\x98represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Zuber </em>v. <em>Allen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/168/index.html">396 U.

In the law review article that the Court refers to, the professors were merely saying that the text of the statute was susceptible to an overly broad (and simplistic) reading, and that clarification in the House Report was therefore appropriate.  See Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L.\xc2\xa0J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] Significantly, the reference to <em>Zahn </em>in the House Report does not at all appear to be tacked-on or out of place; indeed, it is wholly consistent with the Report\xe2\x80\x99s broader explanation of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of overruling <em>Finley </em>and preserving pre-<em>Finley </em>law.  To suggest that these professors participated in a \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23, reveals an unrealistic view of the legislative process, not to mention disrespect for three law professors who acted in the role of public servants.

See <em>ante</em>, at 20.  That conclusion is difficult to accept.  Given Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive account of the statutory text and its jurisprudential backdrop, and given the uncommonly clear legislative history, I am confident that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71367 is mistaken.

A danger is that that result of the effort to deal with all the foreseeables will be a statute too prolix and baroque for everyday use and application by practitioners and judges.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332), but original federal-court jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law (28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331).  The plaintiff in <em>Finley</em> sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b), to recover for the death of her husband and children in an airplane crash.  She alleged that the Federal Aviation Administration\xe2\x80\x99s negligence contributed to the fatal accident.  She later amended her complaint to add state-law tort claims against two other defendants, a municipality and a utility company.  490 U. S., at 546\xe2\x80\x93547.  No independent basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed over the state-law claims.  The plaintiff could not have brought her entire action in state court, because federal jurisdiction in FTCA actions is exclusive.  \xc2\xa71346(b).  Hence, absent federal jurisdiction embracing the state-law claims, she would be obliged to pursue two discrete actions, one in federal court, the other in state court.  This Court held, nevertheless, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the \xe2\x80\x9cpendent-party\xe2\x80\x9d state-law claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 555\xe2\x80\x93556.  In so holding, the Court stressed that Congress held the control rein.  <em>Id.</em>, at 547\xe2\x80\x93549.  Congress could reverse the result in <em>Finley</em>, and permit pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims against additional defendants, if it so chose.  <em>Id</em>., at 556.  Congress did so in \xc2\xa71367.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What more \xc2\xa71367 wrought is an issue on which courts of appeals have sharply divided.  Compare <em>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc</em>. v. <em>Press Mechanical, Inc.</em>, 77 F. 3d 928, 930 (CA7 1996) (\xc2\xa71367 \xe2\x80\x9csupersedes <em>Clark </em>and allows pendent-party jurisdiction when the additional parties have claims worth less than [the jurisdictional minimum]\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>In\xc2\xa0re Abbott Labs.,</em> 51 F.\xc2\xa03d 524, 529 (CA5 1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder \xc2\xa71367 a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over members of a class, although they did not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, as did the class representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Meritcare Inc.</em> v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins.

The Court today holds that \xc2\xa71367, although prompted by <em>Finley</em>, a case in which original access to federal court was predicated on a federal question, notably enlarges federal diversity jurisdiction.  The Court reads \xc2\xa71367 to overrule <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em>, thereby allowing access to federal court by co-plaintiffs or class members who do not meet the now in excess of $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement, so long as at least one co-plaintiff, or the named class representative, has a jurisdictionally sufficient claim.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court adopts a plausibly broad reading of \xc2\xa71367, a measure that is hardly a model of the careful drafter\xe2\x80\x99s art.  There is another plausible reading, however, one less disruptive of our jurisprudence regarding supplemental jurisdiction.  If one reads \xc2\xa71367(a) to instruct, as the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text suggests, that the district court must first have \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d before supplemental jurisdiction can attach, then <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em> are preserved, and supplemental jurisdiction does not open the way for joinder of plaintiffs, or inclusion of class members, who do not independently meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this narrower construction is the better reading of \xc2\xa71367. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367, captioned \xe2\x80\x9cSupplemental jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d codifies court-recognized doctrines formerly labeled \xe2\x80\x9cpendent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cancillary\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  Pendent jurisdiction involved the enlargement of federal-question litigation to include related state-law claims.  Ancillary jurisdiction evolved primarily to protect defending parties, or others whose rights might be adversely affected if they could not air their claims in an ongoing federal-court action.

Congress did not take up the Study Committee\xe2\x80\x99s immodest proposal to curtail diversity jurisdiction.  It did, however, enact a supplemental jurisdiction statute, codified as 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71367.  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367, by its terms, operates only in civil actions \xe2\x80\x9cof which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d relevant here is diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, conferred by \xc2\xa71332.  The character of that jurisdiction is the essential backdrop for comprehension of \xc2\xa71367.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution broadly provides for federal-court jurisdiction in controversies \xe2\x80\x9cbetween Citizens of different States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, cl. 1.  This Court has read that provision to demand no more than \xe2\x80\x9cminimal diversity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, so long as one party on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 side and one party on the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 side are of diverse citizenship, Congress may authorize federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction.  See <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</em> v. <em>Tashire,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/523/index.html">386 U. S. 523</a>, 530\xe2\x80\x93531 (1967).  Further, the Constitution includes no amount-in-controversy limitation on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.  But from the start, Congress, as its measures have been construed by this Court, has limited federal court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in two principal ways.  First, unless Congress specifies otherwise, diversity must be \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, all parties on plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 side must be diverse from all parties on defendants\xe2\x80\x99 side.  <em>Strawbridge </em>v. <em>Curtiss</em>, 3 Cranch 267 (1806); see 13B Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa73605 (2d ed. 1984).  Second, each plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s stake must independently meet the amount-in-controversy specification: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen two or more plaintiffs, having separate and distinct demands, unite for convenience and economy in a single suit, it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Troy Bank,</em> 222 U. S., at 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute today governing federal court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in the generality of cases, \xc2\xa71332, like all its predecessors, incorporates both a diverse-citizenship requirement and an amount-in-controversy specification.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As to the latter, the statute reads:  \xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction [in diversity-of-citizenship cases] where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum \xe2\x80\xa6 of $75,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(a).  This Court has long held that, in determining whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied, a single plaintiff may aggregate two or more claims against a single defendant, even if the claims are unrelated.  See, <em>e.g., Edwards</em> v. <em>Bates County,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/163/269/index.html">163 U. S. 269</a>, 273 (1896).  But in multiparty cases, including class actions, we have unyieldingly adhered to the nonaggregation rule stated in <em>Troy Bank</em>.  See <em>Clark</em>, 306 U. S., at 589 (reaffirming the \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar rule that when several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a single suit, the amount involved in each separate controversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts cannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/332/index.html">394 U. S. 332</a>, 339\xe2\x80\x93340 (1969) (abandonment of the nonaggregation rule in class actions would undercut the congressional \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose . . . to check, to some degree, the rising caseload of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court most recently addressed \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he meaning of [\xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s] \xe2\x80\x98matter in controversy\xe2\x80\x99 language\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Zahn</em>, 414 U. S., at 298.  <em>Zahn</em>, like <em>Snyder</em> decided four years earlier, was a class action.  In <em>Snyder</em>, no class member had a claim large enough to satisfy the jurisdictional amount.  But in <em>Zahn</em>, the named plaintiffs had such claims.  414 U. S., at 292.  Nevertheless, the Court declined to depart from its \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding construction of the \xe2\x80\x98matter in controversy\xe2\x80\x99 requirement of \xc2\xa71332.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 301.  The <em>Zahn </em>Court stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Snyder</em> invoked the well-established rule that each of several plaintiffs asserting separate and distinct claims must satisfy the jurisdictional-amount requirement if his claim is to survive a motion to dismiss.  This rule plainly mandates not only that there may be no aggregation and that the entire case must be dismissed where none of the plaintiffs claims [meets the amount-in-controversy requirement] but also requires that any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 300.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe rule that each plaintiff must independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, unless Congress ex-pressly orders otherwise, was thus the solidly established reading of \xc2\xa71332 when Congress enacted the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, which added \xc2\xa71367 to Title 28.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases present the question whether Congress abrogated the nonaggregation rule long tied to \xc2\xa71332 when it enacted \xc2\xa71367.  In answering that question, \xe2\x80\x9ccontext [should provide] a crucial guide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosario Ortega </em>v. <em>Star-Kist Foods, Inc.,</em> 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 124, 135 (2004).  The Court should assume, as it ordinarily does, that Congress legislated against a background of law already in place and the historical development of that law.  See<em> National Archives and Records Admin.</em> v. <em>Favish,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/157/index.html">541 U. S. 157</a>, 169 (2004).  Here, that background is the statutory grant of diversity jurisdiction, the amount-in-controversy condition that Congress, from the start, has tied to the grant, and the nonaggregation rule this Court has long applied to the determination of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter in controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1367(a) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.  Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court is unanimous in reading \xc2\xa71367(a) to permit pendent-party jurisdiction in federal-question cases, and thus, to overrule <em>Finley</em>.  The basic jurisdictional grant, \xc2\xa71331, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since 1980, \xc2\xa71331 has contained no amount-in-controversy requirement.  See 94 Stat. 2369 (eliminating \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy requirement).  Once there is a civil action presenting a qualifying claim arising under federal law, \xc2\xa71331\xe2\x80\x99s sole requirement is met.  District courts, we have held, may then adjudicate, additionally, state-law claims \xe2\x80\x9cderiv[ing] from a common nucleus of operative fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gibbs,</em> 383 U. S., at 725.  Section 1367(a) enlarges that category to include not only state-law claims against the defendant named in the federal claim, but also \xe2\x80\x9c[state-law] claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court divides, however, on the impact of \xc2\xa71367(a) on diversity cases controlled by \xc2\xa71332.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, \xc2\xa71367(a) permits the joinder of related claims cut loose from the nonaggregation rule that has long attended actions under \xc2\xa71332.  Only the claims specified in \xc2\xa71367(b)[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] would be excluded from \xc2\xa71367(a)\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s grant of diversity jurisdiction.  And because \xc2\xa71367(b) contains no exception for joinder of plaintiffs under Rule 20 or class actions under Rule 23, the Court concludes, <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em> have been overruled.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading is surely plausible, especially if one detaches \xc2\xa71367(a) from its context and attempts no reconciliation with prior interpretations of \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s amount-in-controversy requirement.  But \xc2\xa71367(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, as the First Circuit held, can be read another way, one that would involve no rejection of <em>Clark</em> and <em>Zahn</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained by the First Circuit in <em>Ortega</em>, and applied to class actions by the Tenth Circuit in <em>Leonhardt</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, \xc2\xa71367(a) addresses \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action[s] of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d a formulation that, in diversity cases, is sensibly read to incorporate the rules on joinder and aggregation tightly tied to \xc2\xa71332 at the time of \xc2\xa71367\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  On this reading, a complaint must first meet that \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d measurement.  If it does not, no supplemental jurisdiction is authorized.  If it does, \xc2\xa71367(a) authorizes \xe2\x80\x9csupplemental jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d over related claims.  In other words, \xc2\xa71367(a) would preserve undiminished, as part and parcel of \xc2\xa71332 \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d determinations,  both the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete diversity\xe2\x80\x9d rule and the decisions restricting aggregation to arrive at the amount in controversy.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Section 1367(b)\xe2\x80\x99s office, then, would be \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent the erosion of the complete diversity [and amount-in-controversy] requirement[s] that might otherwise result from an expansive application of what was once termed the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Pfander, Supplemental Jurisdiction and Section 1367: The Case for a Sympathetic Textualism, 148 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 109, 114 (1999); <em>infra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  In contrast to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa71367, which draws a sharp line between the diversity and amount-in-controversy components of \xc2\xa71332, see <em>ante</em>, at 6; <em>supra</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa05, the interpretation presented here does not sever the two jurisdictional requirements.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more restrained reading of \xc2\xa71367 just outlined would yield affirmance of the First Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Ortega</em>, and reversal of the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Exxon</em>.  It would not discard entirely, as the Court does, the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction as they existed when <em>Finley</em> was decided.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Instead, it would recognize \xc2\xa71367 essentially as a codification of those doctrines, placing them under a single heading, but largely retaining their substance, with overriding <em>Finley</em> the only basic change: Supplemental jurisdiction, once the district court has original jurisdiction, would now include \xe2\x80\x9cclaims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71367(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pendent jurisdiction, as earlier explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, applied only in federal-question cases and allowed plaintiffs to attach nonfederal claims to their jurisdiction-qualifying claims.  Ancillary jurisdiction applied primarily, although not exclusively, in diversity cases and \xe2\x80\x9ctypically involve[d] claims <em>by a defending party</em> haled into court against his will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kroger,</em> 437 U. S., at 376 (emphasis added); see also <em>id.</em>, at 375, n.\xc2\xa018; <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  As the First Circuit observed, neither doctrine permitted a plaintiff to circumvent the dual requirements of \xc2\xa71332 (diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy) \xe2\x80\x9csimply by joining her [jurisdictionally inadequate] claim in an action brought by [a] jurisdictionally competent diversity plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ortega</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 138.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only would the reading I find persuasive \xe2\x80\x9calig[n] statutory supplemental jurisdiction with the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, it would also synchronize \xc2\xa71367 with the removal statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441.  As the First Circuit carefully explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSection 1441, like \xc2\xa71367, applies only if the \xe2\x80\x98civil action\xe2\x80\x99 in question is one \xe2\x80\x98of which the district courts \xe2\x80\xa6 have original jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x99  \xc2\xa71441(a).  Relying on that language, the Supreme Court has interpreted \xc2\xa71441 to prohibit removal unless the entire action, as it stands at the time of removal, could have been filed in federal court in the first instance.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/28/index.html">537 U. S. 28</a>, 33 (2002); <em>Okla. Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/838/index.html">489 U. S. 838</a>, 840 (1989) (per curiam).  Section 1441 has thus been held to incorporate the well-pleaded complaint rule, <em>see City of Chicago</em> [v. <em>International College of Surgeons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/156/index.html"></a><a href="/us/522/156/index.html">522 U.

If one reads \xc2\xa71367(a) as a plenary grant of supplemental jurisdiction to federal courts sitting in diversity, one would indeed look for exceptions in \xc2\xa71367(b).  Finding none for permissive joinder of parties or class actions, one would conclude that Congress effectively, even if unintentionally, overruled <em>Clark </em>and <em>Zahn</em>.  But if one recognizes that the nonaggregation rule delineated in <em>Clark </em>and <em>Zahn</em> forms part of the determination whether \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d exists in a diversity case, see <em>supra</em>, at 14, then plaintiffs who do not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement would fail at the \xc2\xa71367(a) threshold.  Congress would have no reason to resort to a \xc2\xa71367(b) exception to turn such plaintiffs away from federal court, given that their claims, from the start, would fall outside the court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71332 jurisdiction.  See Pfander, 148 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 148.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the more moderate reading assign different meanings to \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in diversity and federal-question cases.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  As the First Circuit stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[O]riginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa71367(a) has the same meaning in every case: [An] underlying statutory grant of original jurisdiction must be satisfied.  What differs between federal question and diversity cases is not the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 but rather the [discrete] requirements of sections 1331 and 1332.  Under \xc2\xa71331, the sole issue is whether a federal question appears on the face of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s well-pleaded complaint; the [citizenship] of the parties and the amounts they stand to recover [do not bear on that determination].  Section 1332, by contrast, predicates original jurisdiction on the identity of the parties (<em>i.e.</em>, [their] complete diversity) and their [satisfaction of the amount-in-controversy specification].  [In short,] the \xe2\x80\x98original jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 language in \xc2\xa71367 operates differently in federal-question and diversity cases not because the meaning of that term varies, but because the [jurisdiction-granting] statutes are different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ortega</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is the utility of \xc2\xa71367(b) under my reading of \xc2\xa71367(a)?  Section 1367(a) allows parties other than the plaintiff to assert <em>reactive </em>claims once entertained under the heading ancillary jurisdiction.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5 (listing claims, including compulsory counterclaims and impleader claims, over which federal courts routinely exercised ancillary jurisdiction).  As earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at  14, \xc2\xa71367(b) stops plaintiffs from circumventing \xc2\xa71332\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional requirements by using another\xe2\x80\x99s claim as a hook to add a claim that the plaintiff could not have brought in the first instance.  <em>Kroger </em>is the paradigm case.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  There, the Court held that ancillary jurisdiction did not extend to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim against a nondiverse party who had been impleaded by the defendant under Rule 14.  Section 1367(b), then, is corroborative of \xc2\xa71367(a)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of claims formerly called ancillary, but provides exceptions to assure that accommo-dation of added claims would not fundamentally alter \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Pfander, <em>supra,</em> at 135\xe2\x80\x93137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While \xc2\xa71367\xe2\x80\x99s enigmatic text[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] defies flawless interpretation, see <em>supra</em>, at 13, n. 8,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] the precedent-preservative reading, I am persuaded, better accords with the historical and legal context of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of the supplemental jurisdiction statute, see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, 11, and the established limits on pendent and ancillary jurisdiction, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.  It does not attribute to Congress a jurisdictional enlargement broader than the one to which the legislators adverted, cf. <em>Finley</em>, 490 U.

Section 1332 itself, however, does not rank order the two requirements.

In partial explanation, the Court asserts that amount in controversy can be analyzed claim-by-claim, but the diversity requirement cannot.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  It is not altogether clear why that should be so.  The cure for improper joinder of a nondiverse party is the same as the cure for improper joinder of a plaintiff who does not satisfy the jurisdictional amount.  In both cases, original jurisdiction can be preserved by dismissing the nonqualifying party.

Such review, it was unsuccessfully argued, was \xe2\x80\x9cappellate\xe2\x80\x9d in character, and therefore outside the ken of a court empowered to exercise \xe2\x80\x9coriginal\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  Compare 522 U. S., at 166\xe2\x80\x93168, with <em>id</em>., at 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court notes the passage this year of the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109\xe2\x80\x932, 119 Stat. 4, <em>ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, only to dismiss that legislation as irrelevant.  Subject to several exceptions and qualifications, CAFA provides for federal-court adjudication of state-law-based class actions in which diversity is \xe2\x80\x9cminimal\xe2\x80\x9d (one plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s diversity from one defendant suffices), and the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter in controversy\xe2\x80\x9d is an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000.  Significant here, CAFA\xe2\x80\x99s enlargement of federal-court diversity jurisdiction was accomplished, \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and conspicuously,\xe2\x80\x9d by amending \xc2\xa71332.
