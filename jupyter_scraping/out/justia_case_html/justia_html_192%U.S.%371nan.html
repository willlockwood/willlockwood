"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 192 U. S. 382</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"That said post office at Harvey was an intermediate post office, and was located not more than eighty rods from defendant\'s railroad station, or depot at or near said Town of Harvey."</p>\n<p>"That, under said postal regulation, it was the duty of said defendant to provide a sufficient and safe receptacle or place for the safety and security of said mail while in its said custody; also to safely care for and guard said mail sack and its contents during the night; also to safely deliver the same to the postmaster or postmistress at the post office in said Town of Harvey, North Dakota."</p>\n<p>"But, neglecting its said duty in the premises, defendant wholly failed and neglected to provide any receptacle or place for the safe or secure keeping of mail, and also failed to place a duly sworn official in charge of said mail sack, and further wholly failed to safely care for or guard said mail sack and its contents, and also wholly failed to safely deliver the same at the post office to the postmaster in said Town of Harvey."</p>\n<p>And further, that defendant\'s roadmaster entered the depot, unlocked the mail bag with a key he had unlawfully caused to be made, abstracted the package of currency, and converted its contents; that the room where the mail bag was placed was "not designed or capable of safely keeping valuable articles or property," and that it was through the negligence of defendant and its station agent that the man gained entrance to the room and obtained access to the mail bag.</p>\n<p>It will be perceived that plaintiff relied on principles of general law applicable to negligence, and to the liability of defendant if there were negligence, and nowhere asserted a right which might be defeated or the Constitution or of any law of the United the Constitution or of any law of the United States.  The complaint did indeed deny that there was any contract between defendant and the government, but that was merely a conclusion of law, inconsistent with the statutes and with the facts alleged.  And whether the duty counted on was imposed by law or arose from contract, the question remained whether defendant was a public agent of the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 192 U. S. 383</a></p><p> States and the consequences of that relation, and the construction of no provision of the Constitution or of any law of the United States on which the recovery depended was put in controversy.</p>\n<p>In other words, no definite issue in respect of a right claimed under the Constitution or any law of the United States was deducible from plaintiff\'s statement of its case, and if the postal regulations could, under circumstances, be regarded as laws of the United States creating a right which might be denied or secured according to one construction or another, it did not appear that the construction of the extract from section 713 of those regulations was in any way in dispute, or could have been.  And the averments of the complaint cannot be helped out by resort to the other pleadings or to judicial knowledge.  <em>Mountain View &amp;c. Company v.

But the alleged cause of action was not referable to those laws or put on the ground that defendant was an officer or public agent of the United States.  That was matter of defense, and could not be and was not resorted to by plaintiff to obtain jurisdiction.  <em>Tennessee v.

Pennsylvania Railroad Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/113/218/case.html">113 U. S. 218</a></span>, which was a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the question arose whether a railway mail clerk was a passenger within a certain statute of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion, said:</p>\n<p>"The plaintiff argues here, and insisted throughout the progress of the case in the state courts, that by reason of certain laws of the United States as applied to the facts found in the verdict of the jury, the decedent was a passenger, and the supreme court erred in holding otherwise.  These laws are thus cited in the brief of plaintiff\'s counsel:"</p>\n<p>"   Act of March 3, 1865, \xc2\xa7 8, 13 Stat. 506, provides that \'For the purpose of assorting and distributing letters and other matter in railway post offices, the Postmaster General may, from time to time, appoint clerks, who shall be paid out of the appropriation for mail transportation.\'"</p>\n<p>"   \xc2\xa7 4000 Rev.Stat. requires that \'every railway company carrying the mail shall carry on any train which may run over its road, and without extra charge therefor, all mailable matter directed to be carried thereon, with the person in charge of the same.\' "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 192 U. S. 385</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"We do not think these provisions either aid or govern the construction of the proviso in the Pennsylvania statute."</p>\n<p>"The person thus to be carried with the mail matter, without extra charge, is no more a passenger because he is in charge of the mail, nor because no other compensation is made for his transportation, than if he had no such charge; nor does the fact that he is in the employment of the United States, and that defendant is bound, by contract with the government, to carry him, affect the question.  It would be just the same if the company had contracted with any other person who had charge of freight on the train to carry him without additional compensation.  The statutes of the United States which authorize this employment and direct this service do not therefore make the person so engaged a passenger, or deprive him of that character, in construing the Pennsylvania statute.  Nor does it give to persons so employed any right as against the railroad company which would not belong to any other person in a similar employment by others than the United States.  We are therefore of opinion that no question of federal authority was involved in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and the writ of error is accordingly dismissed."</p>\n<p>Although that case was a writ of error to a state court, it was held in effect that it was too obvious for controversy that the acts of Congress referred to did not give the mail clerk any particular right as against the railroad company in respect of negligence and therefore this Court declined to entertain the writ.</p>\n<p>We repeat that the rule is settled that a case does not arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States unless it appears from plaintiff\'s own statement, in the outset, that some title, right, privilege, or immunity on which recover depends will be defeated by one construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or sustained by the opposite construction.  <em>&lt;|96 U.S. 199|&gt;Gold-Washing &amp;c.
