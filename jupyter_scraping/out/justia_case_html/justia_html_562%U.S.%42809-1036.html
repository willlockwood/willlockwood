Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further review, but the Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribunal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans.  A veteran must file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date when the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decision is properly mailed.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77266(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the VA denied David Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s claim for supplemental disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court, missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  Henderson argued that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable tolling principles.  While his appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/205/index.html">551 U. S. 205</a>, which held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d so that a party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file within that period could not be excused.  The Veterans Court concluded that <em>Bowles</em> compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s untimely appeal.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court does not have jurisdictional consequences.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Branding a procedural rule as going to a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.  Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  Jurisdictional rules may also cause a waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since objections may be raised at any time, even after trial.  Because of these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory capacity, <em>i.e.,</em> its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.  <em>E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc.</em> v. <em>Muchnick</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Among the rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are \xe2\x80\x9cclaim-processing rules,\xe2\x80\x9d which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.  Although filing deadlines are quintessential claim-processing rules, Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.  <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>,<em> </em>applied a \xe2\x80\x9creadily administrable bright line\xe2\x80\x9d rule to determine whether Congress has done so: There must be a \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d indication that Congress wanted the rule to be \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontext, including this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Reed Elsevier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___, to whether Congress has spoken clearly on this point.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline here be jurisdictional.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here.  All of the cases they cite\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g., Bowles, supra;</em> <em>Stone</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/386/index.html">514 U. S. 386</a>; and <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/467/index.html">476 U. S. 467</a>\xe2\x80\x94involved review by Article III courts.  This case, by contrast, involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme.  Instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions, this Court attempts to ascertain Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent regarding the particular type of review at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant to be jurisdictional.  The terms of \xc2\xa77266(a), which sets the deadline, provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences.  It neither speaks in \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional terms\xe2\x80\x9d nor refers \xe2\x80\x9cin any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 394.  Nor does \xc2\xa77266\xe2\x80\x99s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication.  Its placement in a subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure,\xe2\x80\x9d and not in the subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOrganization and Jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Congress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule.  Most telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits claims.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 longstanding solicitude for veterans, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/643/index.html">366 U. S. 643</a>, 647, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions.  The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\xe2\x80\x94which provided the context in <em>Bowles\xe2\x80\x94</em>and the system Congress created for veterans is dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be commenced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adversarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  By contrast, a veteran need not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA proceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veterans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence.  A veteran who loses before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a Board decision in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor is final.  And a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply with this scheme.  Particularly in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 favor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>King</em> v. <em>St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/index.html">502 U. S. 215</a>, 220\xe2\x80\x93221, n.\xc2\xa09, this Court sees no clear indication that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help in interpreting \xc2\xa77266(a).  Section 7266(a) was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.

To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date when the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decision is properly mailed.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77266(a).  This case presents the question whether a veteran\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a notice of appeal within the 120-day period should be regarded as having \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d consequences.  We hold that it should not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans\xe2\x80\x99 claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the veteran may obtain <em>de novo</em> review by the Board of Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency\xe2\x80\x99s final decision in cases appealed to it.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77101, 7104(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The VA\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory \xe2\x80\x9cprocess is designed to function throughout with a high degree of informality and solicitude for the claimant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Walters</em> v. <em>National Assn. of Radiation Survivors</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/305/index.html">473 U. S. 305</a>, 311 (1985).  A veteran faces no time limit for filing a claim, and once a claim is filed, the VA\xe2\x80\x99s process for adjudicating it at the regional office and the Board is <em>ex parte</em> and nonadversarial, 38 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73.103(a), 20.700(c) (2010).  The VA has a statutory duty to assist veterans in developing the evidence necessary to substantiate their claims.  38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75103(a) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 5103A (2006 ed.).  And when evaluating claims, the VA must give veterans the \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit of \nthe doubt\xe2\x80\x9d whenever positive and negative evidence on \na material issue is roughly equal.  \xc2\xa75107(b).  If a regional office denies a claim, the veteran has a generous one-year time limit to initiate an appeal to the Board.  \xc2\xa77105(b)(1); 38 CFR \xc2\xa720.302(a).  A veteran may also reopen a previously denied claim at any time by presenting \xe2\x80\x9cnew and material evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d 38 U.

While proceedings before the Veterans Court are adversarial, see \xc2\xa77263, veterans have a remarkable record of success before that tribunal.

Federal Circuit decisions may in turn be reviewed by this Court by writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See \xc2\xa77266(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s appeal as untimely.  It concluded that Henderson was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.  Later, the court granted Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s motion for reconsideration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argument.  While Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, however, we decided <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/205/index.html">551 U. S. 205</a> (2007).  In <em>Bowles</em>, we held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72107(c) (2006 ed., Supp. III), is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d and we therefore held that a party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a notice of appeal within that period could not be excused based on equitable factors, or on the opposing party\xe2\x80\x99s forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late filing.  <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 213\xe2\x80\x93214.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After we announced our decision in <em>Bowles</em>, the Veterans Court directed the parties to brief that decision\xe2\x80\x99s effect on prior Federal Circuit precedent that allowed the equitable tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court.  A divided panel of the Veterans Court concluded that <em>Bowles</em> compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>Peake</em>, 22 Vet. App. 217 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a divided en banc court affirmed.  589 F.\xc2\xa03d 1201 (2009).  We granted certiorari.  561 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, as in others that have come before us in recent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc.</em> v. <em>Muchnick</em>, 559 U. S. ___ (2010); <em>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central Region</em>, 558 U. S. ___ (2009); <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Arbaugh</em> v. \n<em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a> (2006); <em>Eberhart </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/12/index.html">546 U.

This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/331/index.html">548 U. S. 331</a>, 356\xe2\x80\x93357 (2006).  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  See <em>Arbaugh</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 514.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See <em>Sanchez-Llamas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 356\xe2\x80\x93357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>Arbaugh</em>, 546 U. S., at 508.  Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if the party had previously acknowledged the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And if the trial court lacked jurisdiction, many months of work on the part of the attorneys and the court may be wasted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.  <em>Reed Elsevier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6); <em>Kontrick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 455.  Other rules, even if important and mandatory, we have said, should not be given the jurisdictional brand.  See <em>Union Pacific</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called \xe2\x80\x9cclaim-processing rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 14); <em>Eberhart</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 19; <em>Scarborough</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 413\xe2\x80\x93414; <em>Kontrick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 455\xe2\x80\x93456.  Filing deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue here, are quintessential claim-processing rules.  Accordingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Circuit, and this opinion could end at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule.  See <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 212\xe2\x80\x93213.  The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Arbaugh</em>, we applied a \xe2\x80\x9creadily administrable bright line\xe2\x80\x9d rule for deciding such questions.  546 U. S., at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.  Under <em>Arbaugh</em>, we look to see if there is any \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d indication that Congress wanted the rule to be \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This approach is suited to capture Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent and also provides helpful guidance for courts and litigants, who will be \xe2\x80\x9cduly instructed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding a rule\xe2\x80\x99s nature.  See<em> id.</em>, at 514\xe2\x80\x93515, and n.\xc2\xa011.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, of course, need not use magic words in order to speak clearly on this point.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontext, including this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reed Elsevier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 13).  When \xe2\x80\x9ca long line of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Union Pacific</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 13), has treated a similar requirement as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d we will presume that Congress intended to follow that course.  See <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/130/index.html">552 U.

The Government reads <em>Bowles</em> to mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in civil cases are jurisdictional.  Since \xc2\xa77266(a) establishes a statutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the Government reasons, that deadline is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject the major premise of this syllogism.  <em>Bowles</em> did not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking judicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional.  Instead, <em>Bowles </em>concerned an appeal from<em> </em>one court to another court.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccentury\xe2\x80\x99s worth of precedent and practice in American courts\xe2\x80\x9d on which <em>Bowles</em> relied involved appeals of that type.  See 551 U. S., at 209\xe2\x80\x93210, and n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contending that <em>Bowles\xe2\x80\x99 </em>reasoning extends to the judicial review of administrative decisions, the Government<em> </em>relies on <em>Stone</em> v. <em>INS</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/386/index.html">514 U. S. 386</a> (1995).  There, without elaboration, we described as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98mandatory and jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the deadline for seeking review in the courts of appeals of final removal orders of the Board of Immigration Appeals.  <em>Id.</em>, at 405 (quoting <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/33/index.html">495 U. S. 33</a>, 45 (1990)).  The Government also notes that lower court decisions have uniformly held that the Hobbs Act\xe2\x80\x99s 60-day time limit for filing a petition for review of certain final agency decisions, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72344, is jurisdictional.  Brief for United States 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner correctly observes, however, that Veterans Court review of a VA decision denying benefits differs in many respects from court of appeals review of an agency decision under the Hobbs Act.  Cf. <em>Shinseki</em> v. <em>Sanders</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 15) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress has made clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency\xe2\x80\x9d).  And there is force to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a more ap-propriate analog is judicial review of an administrative decision denying Social Security disability benefits.  The Social Security disability benefits program, like the veterans benefits program, is \xe2\x80\x9cunusually protective\xe2\x80\x9d of claimants, <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Day</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/104/index.html">467 U.

Indeed, the Government acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Social Security and veterans-benefit review mechanisms share significant common attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 16.  And long before Congress enacted the VJRA, we held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social Security benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7405(g), is not jurisdictional.  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/467/index.html">476 U.

All of those cases involved review by Article III courts.  This case, by contrast, involves review by an Article I tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme.  Instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions, we attempt to ascertain Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent regarding the particular type of review at issue in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several factors convince us that the 120-day deadline for seeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have jurisdictional attributes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms of the provision setting that deadline, 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear evidence, that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences.  Section 7266(a) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to obtain review by the Court of Appeals \nfor Veterans Claims of a final decision of the Board \nof Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Appeals, a person adversely affected by such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the Court within 120 days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e) of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This provision \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zipes</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/385/index.html">455 U. S. 385</a>, 394 (1982).  If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.  This latter provision states that Federal Circuit review must be obtained \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77292(a).  Because the time for taking an appeal from a district court to a court of appeals in a civil case has long been understood to be jurisdictional, see <em>Bowles</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 209\xe2\x80\x93210, and n.\xc2\xa02<em>, </em>this language clearly signals an intent to impose the same restrictions on appeals from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit.  But the 120-day limit at issue in this case is not framed in comparable terms.  It is true that \xc2\xa77266 is cast in mandatory language, but we have rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9call mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are \xe2\x80\xa6 properly typed jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Union Pacific</em>, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting <em>Arbaugh</em>, 546 U. S., at 510; internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, the language of \xc2\xa77266 provides no clear indication that Congress wanted that provision to be treated as having jurisdictional attributes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does \xc2\xa77266\xe2\x80\x99s placement within the VJRA provide such an indication.  Congress placed \xc2\xa77266, numbered \xc2\xa74066 in the enacting legislation, in a subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cProcedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  See VJRA, \xc2\xa7301, 102 Stat. 4113, 4115\xe2\x80\x934116.  That placement suggests Congress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule.  Cf. <em>INS</em> v. <em>National Center for Immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/183/index.html">502 U. S. 183</a>, 189 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he title of a statute or section can aid in resolving an ambiguity in the legislation\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress elected not to place the 120-day limit in the VJRA subchapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOrganization and Jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 102 Stat. 4113\xe2\x80\x934115.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Within that subchapter, a separate provision, captioned \xe2\x80\x9cJurisdiction; finality of decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d prescribes the jurisdiction of the Veterans Court.  <em>Id</em>., at 4113\xe2\x80\x934114.  Subsection (a) of that provision, numbered \xc2\xa74052 in the enacting legislation, grants the Veterans Court \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the Board or to remand the matter, as appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 4113.  It also prohibits the court from hearing appeals by the VA Secretary.  Subsection (b) limits the court\xe2\x80\x99s review to \xe2\x80\x9cthe record of proceedings before the [VA],\xe2\x80\x9d specifies the scope of that review, and precludes review of the VA\xe2\x80\x99s disability ratings schedule.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Nothing in this provision or in the \xe2\x80\x9cOrganization and Jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d subchapter addresses the time for seeking Veterans Court review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the terms and placement of \xc2\xa77266 provide some indication of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, what is most telling here are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits claims.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/643/index.html">366 U. S. 643</a>, 647 (1961); see also <em>Sanders</em>, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  And that solicitude is plainly reflected in the VJRA, as well as in subsequent laws that \xe2\x80\x9cplace a thumb on the scale in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at ___ (Souter, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).  See, <em>e.\xc2\xa0g.</em>, Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21, 1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA, \xc2\xa7103, 102 Stat. 4106\xe2\x80\x934107.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The contrast between ordinary civil litigation\xe2\x80\x94which provided the context of our decision in <em>Bowles</em>\xe2\x80\x94and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see \xc2\xa71291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain <em>de novo</em> review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran\xe2\x80\x99s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting \xe2\x80\x9cnew and material evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have long applied \xe2\x80\x9cthe canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 favor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>King</em> v. <em>St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/index.html">502 U.

Particularly in light this canon, we do not find any clear indication that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that there is no reason to think that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not subject to any further review at all.  Brief for United States 29.  The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.
