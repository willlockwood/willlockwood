Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/639/case.html">358 U.S. 639</a> (1959); Railroad Comm\'n v. Pullman Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/496/case.html">312 U.S. 496</a> ( 1941). </p><p> Here, the Court of Appeals invalidated portions of the nuisance law dealing with the issuance of temporary and permanent injunctions against establishments exhibiting "lewd" or "obscene" matter, on the grounds that, inter alia, (1) "[n]o limits are set forth in the statute to confine the discretion of the court to issue the temporary abatement injunction," <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/631/135/">631 F.2d 135</a>, 138 (CA 9 1980); (2) "there is no assurance that there will occur the required prompt final judicial determination on the merits," ibid.; and (3) "a defense of nonobscenity presumably is unavailable at a trial for violation of an injunction" (emphasis added), ibid. Even a cursory examination of the lengthy statute-which contains detailed definitions of "lewd" or "obscene" matter incorporating the standards of Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html">413 U.S. 15</a> (1973), which provides for consolidation of the trial on the merits with the hearing on the temporary injunction and grants scheduling priority to cases brought under the statute, and which does not specify the defenses available in contempt proceedings-discloses that the state courts might well have construed the law so as to avoid each of these perceived deficiencies. It is ironic that, having exhibited no hesitation to construe the many provisions of this complex statute without guidance from the state courts, the Court of Appeals wholly ignored an explicit severability clause and "declined" to preserve those parts of the statute not found unconstitutional, demurring that the reconstruction required to salvage the statute would be better handled by "the legislature of the State of Washington." 631 F.2d, at 139. </p><p> In sum, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals should have declined to act until the parties had exhausted available state remedies, at least absent a showing that resort to the state courts would have been futile. There was no need whatever for federal courts to render a declaratory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1025">Page 454 U.S. 1022 , 1025</a></p><p> judgment as to the validity of a state law on which the state courts have not yet had an opportunity to speak and on behalf of parties against whom the law has not yet been applied. I would reverse and remand with directions to do now what should have been done initially.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
