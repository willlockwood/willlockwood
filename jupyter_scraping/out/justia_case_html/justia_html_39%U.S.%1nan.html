It is the settled doctrine here that a writ of error does not lie upon the refusal of a motion to quash an execution, such record of refusal not being a final judgment in the sense of the twenty-second section of the Judiciary Act.  We will content ourselves by referring to the opinion of the Court in the cause of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/648/case.html#654">Boyle v.
