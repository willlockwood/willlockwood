They ask for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Comptroller of the Currency and the South Shore National Bank.  They seek to invalidate a ruling by the Comptroller that, incidental to their banking services, national banks may provide travel services for their customers. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Petitioners allege that, as a result, they have lost substantial business and profits and stand to lose even greater business in the future.  They contend the Comptroller exceeded his authority when he authorized national banks to provide travel services. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 400 U. S. 46</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  408 F.2d 1147 (CA1 1969).  Following our decisions last Term in <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html">397 U. S. 150</a></span>, and <em>Barlow v. Collins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/159/case.html">397 U. S. 159</a></span>, we vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration (397 U.S. 315) and the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its previous decision.</p>\n<p>Here, as in <em>Data Processing,</em> we are concerned with \xc2\xa7 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act, 76 Stat. 1132, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1864. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In <em>Data Processing,</em> we did not rely on any legislative history showing that Congress desired to protect data processors alone from competition. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Moreover, we noted a growing trend "toward enlargement of the class of people who may protest administrative action."  397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html#154">397 U. S. 154</a></span>.  We held that \xc2\xa7 4 "arguably brings a competitor within the zone of interests protected by it."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/150/case.html#156">397 U. S. 156</a></span>.  Nothing in the opinion limited \xc2\xa7 4 to protecting only competitors in the data processing field.  When national banks begin to provide travel services for their customers, they compete with travel agents no less than they compete with data processors when they provide data processing services to their customers.

Such services may include the sale of trip insurance and the rental of automobiles, as agent for a local rental service.  In connection therewith, national banks may advertise, develop, and extend such travel services for the purpose of attracting customers to the bank."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>"No bank service corporation may engage in any activity other than the performance of bank services for banks."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The only legislative history of the Bank Service Corporation Act mentioned in the opinion was that \xc2\xa7 4 was a</p>\n<p>""response to the fears expressed by a few senators that, without such a prohibition, the bill would have enabled <em>banks to engage in a nonbanking activity,\' S.Rep.
