That the State is dealing with the funds consistently with the regulations is confirmed by the POMS. The Government has gone even further to support this as a reasonable interpretation, text aside, owing to significant advantages of the reimbursement method in providing accurate documentation and allowing for easy monitoring of representative payees in administering Social Security. <i>Philpott </i>V. <i>Essex County Welfare Bd., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/413/case.html">409 U. S. 413</a>, and <i>Bennett </i>V. <i>Arkansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/395/case.html">485 U. S. 395</a> <i>(per curiam), </i>distinguished. Pp. 382-389.</p><p>(b) The Court rejects the view that this construction of \xc2\xa7 407(a), allowing a state agency to reimburse itself for foster care costs, is antithetical to the child\'s best interests. Respondents\' premise that promoting those interests requires maximizing resources from left-over benefit income ignores the settled administrative law principle that an open-ended and potentially vague term is highly susceptible to administrative interpretation subject to judicial deference. See <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>V. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842-843. Under her statutory authority, the Commissioner has read the beneficiary\'s "interest" in light of the Act\'s basic objectives: to provide a minimum level of income to children who would not otherwise have sufficient resources, see, <i>e. g., Sullivan </i>V. <i>Zebley, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/521/case.html">493 U. S. 521</a>, 524, and to provide workers and their families the income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses, see, <i>e. g., Califano </i>V. <i>Jobst, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/47/case.html">434 U. S. 47</a>, 50. The Commissioner, that is, has decided that a representative payee serves the beneficiary\'s interest by seeing that basic needs are met, not by maximizing a trust fund attributable to fortuitously overlapping state and federal grants. This judgment not only is obviously within reasonable bounds, but is confirmed by the demonstrably antithetical character of respondents\' position to the best interest of many foster care children. If respondents prevailed, many foster children would lose SSI benefits altogether, since eligibility for such benefits is lost if a child\'s resources creep above a certain minimal level, currently <i>$2,000. E. </i>g., 20 CFR \xc2\xa7416.1205(c). In addition, respondents\' argument forgets that public institutions like the department are last in line for appointment as representative payees. If respondents had their way, public offices might well not be there to serve as payees even as the last resort, because many States would be discouraged from accepting appointment as representative payees by the administrative costs of acting in that capacity. With a smaller total pool of money for their potential use, the chances of having funds for genuine needs beyond immediate support would obviously shrink, to the children\'s loss.

When these accounts are debited, it is only rarely for a direct purchase by the State of a foster child\'s food, clothing, and shelter. The usual purchaser is a foster care provider, who is then paid back by the department according to a fixed compensation schedule. Every month, the department compares its payments to the provider of a child\'s care with the child\'s subsidiary account balance, on which the department then draws to reimburse itself. Since the State\'s outlay customarily exceeds a child\'s monthly Social Security benefits, the reimbursement to the State usually leaves the account empty until the next federal benefit check arrives.</p><p>The department occasionally departs from this practice, in the exercise of its discretion, to use the Social Security funds</p><p>2 In April 2001, the department repealed \xc2\xa7 388-70-069 and replaced it with a functionally similar provision.

The Supreme Court of Washington approached respondents\' claim by generalizing from this text and concluding that \xc2\xa7 407(a) prohibits "creditor-type acts," on which reading it held that the department\'s reimbursement scheme was prohibited. The analysis was flawed.</p><p>First, neither \xc2\xa7 407(a) nor the Commissioner\'s regulations interpreting that provision say anything about "creditors." Cf. <i>Philpott, supra, </i>at 417 ("[Section] 407 does not refer to any \'claim of creditors\'; it imposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits"). In fact, the Act and regulations to which we owe deference, see <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U.

Finally, as the Supreme Court of Washington apparently recognized (in qualifying its characterization of "creditor relationship" by referring to the department\'s acts as merely "creditor-type"), the department is simply not a creditor of the foster care children for whom it serves as representative payee. No law provides that they are liable to repay the department for the costs of their care, and the State of Washington makes no such claim.</p><p>The questions to be answered in resolving this case, then, do not go to the State\'s character as a creditor. The questions, instead, are whether the department\'s effort to become a representative payee, or its use of respondents\' Social Security benefits when it acts in that capacity, amounts to em-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="383">383</a></p><p>ploying an "execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 407(a).6 For obvious reasons, respondents do not contend that the department\'s activities involve any execution, levy, attachment, or garnishment. These legal terms of art refer to formal procedures by which one person gains a degree of control over property otherwise subject to the control of another, and generally involve some form of judicial authorization. See, <i>e. </i>g., Black\'s Law Dictionary 123 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "provisional attachment" as a "prejudgment attachment in which the debtor\'s property is seized so that if the creditor ultimately prevails, the creditor will be assured of recovering on the judgment .... Ordinarily, a hearing must be held before the attachment takes place"); id., at 689 (defining "garnishment" as "[a] judicial proceeding in which a creditor (or potential creditor) asks the court to order a third party who is indebted to or is bailee for the debtor to turn over to the creditor any of the debtor\'s property"). The department\'s efforts to become a representative payee and to use respondents\' benefits do not even arguably employ any of these traditional procedures.</p><p>Thus, the case boils down to whether the department\'s manner of gaining control of the federal funds involves "other legal process," as the statute uses that term. That restriction to the statutory usage of "other legal process" is</p><p>6 Respondents have apparently never argued that the reimbursement violates the \xc2\xa7 407(a) bar to "transfe[r]" of benefits; nor would such a claim seem to hold any promise on the facts here. Respondents do, however, contend that the department\'s budgeting in anticipation of receiving Social Security benefits constitutes an "assign[ment]" prohibited by \xc2\xa7 407(a). Congress could hardly have intended for this sort of budgeting, done by private and public representative payees alike, to run afoul of the antiattachment provisions of the Act, particularly since the Administration makes OASDI payments with a I-month lag. See <i>infra, </i>at 387. To the extent that the text of \xc2\xa7 407(a) is ambiguous on this score, the Commissioner\'s interpretation of the provision to permit such budgeting requires deference.

As already noted, the department\'s appointment is consistent with the sections of the Act governing appointment of representative payees, see 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 405(j)(2)(C), (3)(B) and (F), (4)(B), 1383(a)(2)(B)(v), (vii) (II), (C)(ii), (D)(ii), and with the Commissioner\'s regulations interpreting that section to authorize appointment of custodial institutions as a last resort, see 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.2021(b)(7), 416.621(b)(7). To suggest that the department\'s appointment as representative payee, under the same statutory scheme that forbids the use of "other legal process," is itself forbidden legal process disregards the "cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole," <i>King </i>v. <i>St. Vincent\'s Hospital, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/215/case.html">502 U.

Thus, "other legal process" should be understood to be process much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability.</p><p>In this case, the product of these canons of construction is confirmed by legal guidance in the Commissioner\'s own interpretation of "legal process." The Social Security Administration\'s Program Operations Manual System (POMS), the publicly available operating instructions for processing Social Security claims, defines "legal process" as used in \xc2\xa7 407(a) as "the means by which a court (or agency or official authorized by law) compels compliance with its demand; generally, it is a court order." POMS GN 02410.001 (2002), available at <a href="http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/aboutpoms">http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/aboutpoms</a> (as visited Jan. 23, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court\'s case file). Elsewhere in the POMS, the Commissioner defines "legal process" similarly as "any writ, order, summons or other similar process <i>in the nature of garnishment. </i>It may include, but is not limited to, an attachment, writ of execution, income execution order or wage assignment that is issued by ... [a] court of competent jurisdiction ... [or a]n authorized official pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to State or local law ... [a]nd is directed to a governmental entity." POMS GN 02410.200 (emphasis added). While these administrative interpretations are not products of formal rulemaking, they nevertheless warrant respect in closing the door on any suggestion that the usual rules of statutory construction should get short shrift for the sake of reading "other legal process" in abstract breadth. See <i>Skidmore </i>v. <i>Swift </i>&amp; <i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/case.html">323 U.

And although execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment typically involve the exercise of some sort of judicial or quasi-judicial authority to gain control over another\'s property, the department\'s reimbursement scheme operates on funds already in the department\'s possession and control, held on terms that allow the reimbursement.</p><p>The regulations previously quoted specify that payments made for a beneficiary\'s "current maintenance" are deemed to be "for the use and benefit of the beneficiary," and define "current maintenance" to include "cost[s] incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items." 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 404.2040(a), 416.640(a). There is no question that the state funds to be reimbursed were spent for items of "current maintenance," and although the State typically makes the accounting reimbursement two months after spending its own funds, this practice is consistent with the regulation\'s definition of "current maintenance" as "costs incurred" for food and the like.

See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>28-29.10 In fact, it would be hard not to see this type of slightly delayed reimbursement as the only way OASDI funds could be spent on a foster child\'s current maintenance, since the Administration disburses those Social Security benefits with a time lag. See POMS GN 02401.001 (noting that OASDI benefits are dispensed within the month after they are due). In short, the Commissioner\'s interpretation of her own regulations is</p><p>9 There is one exception to this rule, although it is not relevant for our present purposes.

Accordingly, we decline to reach respondents\' \xc2\xa7 405(j) arguments here, except insofar as they relate to the proper interpretation of \xc2\xa7 407(a). Respondents are free to press their stand-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="390">390</a></p><blockquote><p>\n390 WASHINGTON STATE DEPT. OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVS. <i>v. </i>GUARDIANSHIP ESTATE OF KEFFELER</p></blockquote><p>spondents\' premise that promoting the "best interests" of a beneficiary requires maximizing resources from left-over benefit income ignores the settled principle of administrative law that an open-ended and potentially vague term is highly susceptible to administrative interpretation subject to judicial deference. See <i>Chevron, </i>467 U. S., at 842-843. Under her statutory authority, the Commissioner has read the "interest" of the beneficiary in light of the basic objectives of the Act: to provide a "minimum level of income" to children who would not "have sufficient income and resources to maintain a standard of living at the established Federal minimum income level," 20 CFR \xc2\xa7 416.110 (SS1); see also <i>Sullivan </i>v. <i>Zebley, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/521/case.html">493 U. S. 521</a>, 524 (1990), and to provide workers and their families the "income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses," \xc2\xa7 404.508(a) (OASD1); see also <i>Califano </i>v. <i>Jobst, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/47/case.html">434 U. S. 47</a>, 50 (1977). The Commissioner, that is, has decided that a representative payee serves the beneficiary\'s interest by seeing that basic needs are met, not by maximizing a trust fund attributable to fortuitously overlapping state and federal grants.</p><p>This judgment is not only obviously within the bounds of the reasonable, but one confirmed by the demonstrably antithetical character of respondents\' position to the best interest of many foster care children. SSI beneficiaries would be most obviously subject to threat, since eligibility for benefits of these child recipients is lost if their assets creep above a certain minimal level, currently $2,000. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1382(a)(1)(B), (3)(B); 20 CFR \xc2\xa7 416.1205(c). Many foster children would lose SSI benefits altogether if respondents prevailed. See Brief for Children\'s Defense Fund et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>20; Brief for Counties of the State of California et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>16-18. But foster children beneficiaries under both SSI and OASDI would suffer from a broader disadvantage. Respondents\' argument forgets the</p><p>alone \xc2\xa7 405(j) arguments before the Commissioner, who bears responsibility for overseeing representative payees, or elsewhere as appropriate.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="391">391</a></p><p>fact that public institutions like the department are last in the line of eligibility for appointment as representative payees; the Commissioner appoints them only when no one else will do. See 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 404.2021(b), 416.621(b). If respondents had their way, however, public offices like the department might well not be there to serve as payees even as the last resort, for there is reason to believe that if state agencies could not use Social Security benefits to reimburse the State in funding current costs of foster care, many States would be discouraged from accepting appointment as representative payees by the administrative costs of acting in that capacity. See Brief for Children\'s Defense Fund, <i>supra, </i>at 21; Brief for State of Florida et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>7.13 And without such agencies to identify children eligible for federal benefits and to help them qualify, see Brief for Children\'s Defense Fund, <i>supra, </i>at 20-24; Brief for State of Florida, <i>supra, </i>at 3-5; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>17, many eligible children would either obtain no Social Security benefits or need some very good luck to get them. With a smaller total pool of money for their potential use, the chances of having funds for genuine needs beyond immediate support would obviously shrink, to the children\'s loss. Respondents\' position, in sum, would tend to produce worse representative payees in these cases, with less money to spend.</p><p>13 The Act does allow a state representative payee to use the lesser of 10 percent of monthly benefits or $25 per month to offset administrative expenses. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7405(j)(4)(A)(i), 1383(a)(2)(D)(i). Nevertheless, at least with respect to SSl, many States spend considerably more to identify eligible foster children and assist them in obtaining benefits. According to the department, for example, the process of screening potential SSl applicants among foster children and applying for benefits on their behalf involves 27 staff members and costs $1.9 million annually. See Application to Recall and Stay the Mandate of the Supreme Court of Washington Pending Certiorari, No. 01A557, pp. 18-19. For this reason, the department has said that it would not seek to become the representative payee for SSl beneficiaries absent an ability to use benefits to recoup some costs.
