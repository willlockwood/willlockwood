Finally, \xe2\x80\x9cany amount collected by the State under an assignment made\xe2\x80\x9d as described above \xe2\x80\x9cshall be retained by the State \xe2\x80\xa6 to reimburse it for [Medicaid] payments made on behalf of\xe2\x80\x9d the recipient.  \xc2\xa71396k(b).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he remainder of such amount collected shall be paid\xe2\x80\x9d to the recipient.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Acting pursuant to its understanding of these provisions, Arkansas passed laws under which, when a state Medicaid recipient obtains a tort settlement following payment of medical costs on her behalf, a lien is automatically imposed on the settlement in an amount equal to Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s costs.  When that amount exceeds the portion of the settlement representing medical costs, satisfaction of the State\xe2\x80\x99s lien requires payment out of proceeds meant to compensate the recipient for damages distinct from medical costs, such as pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following respondent Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s car accident with allegedly negligent third parties, petitioner Arkansas Department of Health Services (ADHS) determined that Ahlborn was eligible for Medicaid and paid providers $215,645.30 on her behalf.  She filed a state-court suit against the alleged tortfeasors seeking damages for past medical costs and for other items including pain and suffering, loss of earnings and working time, and permanent impairment of her future earning ability.  The case was settled out of court for $550,000, which was not allocated between categories of damages.  ADHS did not participate or ask to participate in the settlement negotiations, and did not seek to reopen the judgment after the case was dismissed, but did intervene in the suit and assert a lien against the settlement proceeds for the full amount it had paid for Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s care.  She filed this action in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the State\xe2\x80\x99s lien violated federal law insofar as its satisfaction would require depletion of compensation for her injuries other than past medical expenses.  The parties stipulated, <em>inter alia,</em> that the settlement amounted to approximately one-sixth of the reasonable value of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s claim and that, if her construction of federal law was correct, ADHS would be entitled to only the portion of the settlement ($35,581.47) that constituted reimbursement for medical payments made.  In granting ADHS summary judgment, the court held that under Arkansas law, which it concluded did not conflict with federal law, Ahlborn had assigned ADHS her right to recover the full amount of Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s payments for her benefit.  The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that ADHS was entitled only to that portion of the settlement that represented payments for medical care.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Federal Medicaid law does not authorize ADHS to assert a lien on Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement in an amount exceeding $35,581.47, and the federal anti-lien provision affirmatively prohibits it from doing so.  Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 third-party liability provisions are unenforceable insofar as they compel a different conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 statute finds no support in the federal third-party liability provisions.  That ADHS cannot claim more than the portion of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement that represents medical expenses is suggested by \xc2\xa71396k(a)(1)(A), which requires that Medicaid recipients, as a condition of eligibility, \xe2\x80\x9cassign the State any rights \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>to payment for medical care</em> from any third party\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), not their rights to payment for, <em>e.g.,</em> lost wages.  The other statutory language ADHS relies on is not to the contrary, but reinforces the assignment provision\xe2\x80\x99s implicit limitation.  First, statutory context shows that \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that States \xe2\x80\x9cseek reimbursement for [medical] assistance <em>to the extent of such legal liability</em>\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal liability of third parties \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>to pay for care and services available under the plan,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(A) (emphases added).  Here, because the tortfeasors accepted liability for only one-sixth of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s overall damages, and ADHS has stipulated that only $35,581.47 of that sum represents compensation for medical expenses, the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cliability\xe2\x80\x9d extends no further than that amount.  Second, \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the State enact laws giving it the right to recover from liable third parties \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent [it made] payment \xe2\x80\xa6 for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual\xe2\x80\x9d does not limit the State\xe2\x80\x99s recovery only by the amount it paid out on the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, since the rest of the provision makes clear that the State must be assigned \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of [the recipient] to payment by any other party <em>for such health care items or services</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Finally, \xc2\xa71396k(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that, where the State actively pursues recovery from the third party, Medicaid be reimbursed fully from \xe2\x80\x9cany amount collected by the State under an assignment\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cthe remainder of such amount collected\xe2\x80\x9d is remitted to the recipient does not show that the State must be paid in full from any settlement.  Rather, because the State\xe2\x80\x99s assigned rights extend only to recovery of medical payments, what \xc2\xa71396k(b) requires is that the State be paid first out of any damages for medical care before the recipient can recover any of her own medical costs.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 statute squarely conflicts with the federal Medicaid law\xe2\x80\x99s anti-lien provision, \xc2\xa71396p(a)(1), which prohibits States from imposing liens \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid \xe2\x80\xa6 on his behalf under the State plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even if the State\xe2\x80\x99s lien is assumed to be consistent with federal law insofar as it encumbers proceeds designated as medical payments, the anti-lien provision precludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.  ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to avoid the anti-lien provision by characterizing the settlement proceeds as not Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d but as the State\xe2\x80\x99s, fails for two reasons.  First, because the settlement is not \xe2\x80\x9creceived from a third party,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by the state statute, until Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s chose in action has been reduced to proceeds in her possession, the assertion that any of the proceeds belonged to the State all along lacks merit.  Second, the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Ahlborn lost her property rights in the proceeds the instant she applied for medical assistance is inconsistent with the creation of a statutory lien on those proceeds: ADHS would not need a lien on its own property.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects as unpersuasive ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that a rule permitting a lien on more than medical damages ought to apply here either because Ahlborn breached her duty to \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate\xe2\x80\x9d with ADHS or because there is an inherent danger of manipulation in cases where the parties to a tort case settle without judicial oversight or input from the State.  As \xc2\xa71396k(a)(1)(C) demonstrates, the duty to cooperate arises principally, if not exclusively, in proceedings initiated <em>by the State</em> to recover from third parties.  In any event, the aspersions cast upon Ahlborn are entirely unsupported; all the record reveals is that ADHS neither asked to be nor was involved in the settlement negotiations.  Whatever the bounds of the duty to cooperate, there is no evidence that it was breached here.  Although more colorable, the alternative argument that a rule of full reimbursement is needed generally to avoid the risk of settlement manipulation also fails.  The risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest can be avoided either by obtaining the State\xe2\x80\x99s advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Eighth Circuit accorded insufficient weight to two decisions by the Departmental Appeals Board (Board) of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rejecting appeals by two States from denial of reimbursement for costs they paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients who had settled tort claims.  Although HHS generally has broad regulatory authority in the Medicaid area, the Court declines to treat the Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in those cases as controlling because they address a different question from the one posed here, make no mention of the anti-lien provision, and rest on a questionable construction of the federal third-party liability provisions.

When that amount exceeds the portion of the settlement that represents medical costs, satisfaction of the State\xe2\x80\x99s lien requires payment out of proceeds meant to compensate the recipient for damages distinct from medical costs\xe2\x80\x94like pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that this statutory lien contravened federal law and was therefore unenforceable.  <em>Ahlborn </em>v. <em>Arkansas Dept. of Human Servs.</em>, 397 F.\xc2\xa03d 620 (2005).  Other courts have upheld similar lien provisions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health</em>, 2002 UT 101, 57 P.\xc2\xa03d 1067; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, 142 Wash. 2d 40, 10 P.\xc2\xa03d 1061 (2000) (en banc).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 2, 1996, respondent Heidi Ahlborn, then a 19-year-old college student and aspiring teacher, suffered severe and permanent injuries as a result of a car accident.  She was left brain damaged, unable to complete her college education, and incapable of pursuing her chosen career.  Although she possessed a claim of uncertain value against the alleged tortfeasors who caused her injuries, Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s liquid assets were insufficient to pay for her medical care.  Petitioner Arkansas Department of Health Services (ADHS) accordingly determined that she was eligible for medical assistance and paid providers $215,645.30 on her behalf under the State\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid plan.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ADHS required Ahlborn to complete a questionnaire about her accident, and sent her attorney periodic letters advising him about Medicaid outlays.  These letters noted that, under Arkansas law, ADHS had a claim to reimbursement from \xe2\x80\x9cany settlement, judgment, or award\xe2\x80\x9d obtained by Ahlborn from \xe2\x80\x9ca third party who may be liable for\xe2\x80\x9d her injuries, and that no settlement \xe2\x80\x9cshall be satisfied without first giving [ADHS] notice and a reasonable opportunity to establish its interest.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  ADHS has never asserted, however, that Ahlborn has a duty to reimburse it out of any other subsequently acquired assets or earnings. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On April 11, 1997, Ahlborn filed suit against two alleged tortfeasors in Arkansas state court seeking compensation for the injuries she sustained in the January 1996 car accident.  She claimed damages not only for past medical costs, but also for permanent physical injury; future medical expenses; past and future pain, suffering, and mental anguish; past loss of earnings and working time; and permanent impairment of the ability to earn in the future.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ADHS was neither named as a party nor formally notified of the suit.  Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did, however, keep ADHS informed of details concerning insurance coverage as they became known during the litigation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 1998, ADHS intervened in Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit to assert a lien on the proceeds of any third-party recovery Ahlborn might obtain.  In October 1998, ADHS asked Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to notify the agency if there was a hearing in the case.  No hearing apparently occurred, and the case was settled out of court sometime in 2002 for a total of $550,000.  The parties did not allocate the settlement between categories of damages.  ADHS did not participate or ask to participate in settlement negotiations.  Nor did it seek to reopen the judgment after the case had been dismissed.  ADHS did, however, assert a lien against the settlement proceeds in the amount of $215,645.30\xe2\x80\x94the total cost of payments made by ADHS for Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s care.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September 30, 2002, Ahlborn filed this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas seeking a declaration that the lien violated the federal Medicaid laws insofar as its satisfaction would require depletion of compensation for injuries other than past medical expenses.  To facilitate the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the legal questions presented, the parties stipulated that Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s entire claim was reasonably valued at $3,040,708.18; that the settlement amounted to approximately one-sixth of that sum; and that, if Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s construction of federal law was correct, ADHS would be entitled to only the portion of the settlement ($35,581.47) that constituted reimbursement for medical payments made.  See App. 17\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that under Arkansas law, which it concluded did not conflict with federal law, Ahlborn had assigned to ADHS her right to any recovery from the third-party tortfeasors to the full extent of Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s payments for her benefit.  Accordingly, ADHS was entitled to a lien in the amount of $215,645.30.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eighth Circuit reversed.  It held that ADHS was entitled only to that portion of the judgment that represented payments for medical care.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The crux of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute lies in their competing constructions of the federal Medicaid laws.  The Medicaid program, which provides joint federal and state funding of medical care for individuals who cannot afford to pay their own medical costs, was launched in 1965 with the enactment of Title XIX of the Social Security Act (SSA), as added 79 Stat. 343, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396 <em>et seq</em>. (2000 ed. and Supp. III).  Its administration is entrusted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), who in turn exercises his authority through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0States are not required to participate in Medicaid, but all of them do.  The program is a cooperative one; the Federal Government pays between 50% and 83% of the costs the State incurs for patient care,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and, in return, the State pays its portion of the costs and complies with certain statutory requirements for making eligibility determinations, collecting and maintaining information, and administering the program.  See \xc2\xa71396a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One such requirement is that the state agency in charge of Medicaid (here, ADHS) \xe2\x80\x9ctake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties . . . to pay for care and services available under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(A) (2000 ed.).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The agency\xe2\x80\x99s obligation extends beyond mere identification, however;  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cin any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the State can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery, the State or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(B). </p>\n<p align="left">\nTo facilitate its reimbursement from liable third parties, the State must,  </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance in any case where a third party has a legal liability to make payment for such assistance, [have] in effect laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H).  </p>\n<p align="left">\nThe obligation to enact assignment laws is reiterated in another provision of the SSA, which reads as follows: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)  For the purpose of assisting in the collection of medical support payments and other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assistance under the State plan approved under this subchapter, a State plan for medical assistance shall\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) provide that, as a condition of eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan to an individual who has the legal capacity to execute an assignment for himself, the individual is required\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) to assign the State any rights . . . to support (specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order) and to payment for medical care from any third party;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) to cooperate with the State . . . in obtaining support and payments (described in paragraph (A)) for himself \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0; and </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(C) to cooperate with the State in identifying, and providing information to assist the State in pursuing, any third party who may be liable to pay for care and services available under the plan . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396k(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFinally, \xe2\x80\x9cany amount collected by the State under an assignment made\xe2\x80\x9d as described above \xe2\x80\x9cshall be retained by the State as is necessary to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made on behalf of\xe2\x80\x9d the Medicaid recipient.  \xc2\xa71396k(b).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he remainder of such amount collected shall be paid\xe2\x80\x9d to the recipient.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acting pursuant to its understanding of these third-party liability provisions, the State of Arkansas passed laws that purport to allow both ADHS and the Medicaid recipient, either independently or together, to recover \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of benefits\xe2\x80\x9d from third parties.  Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93301 through 20\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93309 (2001).  Initially, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a condition of eligibility\xe2\x80\x9d for Medicaid, an applicant \xe2\x80\x9cshall automatically assign his or her right to any settlement, judgment, or award which may be obtained against any third party to [ADHS] to the full extent of any amount which may be paid by Medicaid for the benefit of the applicant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93307(a).  Accordingly, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen medical assistance benefits are provided\xe2\x80\x9d to the recipient \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of injury, disease, or disability for which another person is liable,\xe2\x80\x9d ADHS \xe2\x80\x9cshall have a right to recover from the person the cost of benefits so provided.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93301(a).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 suit \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d not, however, \xe2\x80\x9cbe a bar to any action upon the claim or cause of action of the recipient.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93301(b).  Indeed, the statute envisions that the recipient will sometimes sue together with ADHS, see \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93303, or even alone.  If the latter, the assignment described in \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93307(a) \xe2\x80\x9cshall be considered a statutory lien on any settlement, judgment, or award received . . . from a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93307(c); see also \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93302(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an action or claim is brought by a medical assistance recipient . . . , any settlement, judgment, or award obtained is subject to the division\xe2\x80\x99s claim for reimbursement of the benefits provided to the recipient under the medical assistance program\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State, through this statute, claims an entitlement to more than just that portion of a judgment or settlement that represents payment for medical expenses.  It claims a right to recover the entirety of the costs it paid on the Medicaid recipient\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Accordingly, if, for example, a recipient sues alone and settles her entire action against a third-party tortfeasor for $20,000, and ADHS has paid that amount or more to medical providers on her behalf, ADHS gets the whole settlement and the recipient is left with nothing.  This is so even when the parties to the settlement allocate damages between medical costs, on the one hand, and other injuries like lost wages, on the other.  The same rule also would apply, it seems, if the recovery were the result not of a settlement but of a jury verdict.  In that case, under the Arkansas statute, ADHS could recover the full $20,000 in the face of a jury allocation of, say, only $10,000 for medical expenses.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That this is what the Arkansas statute requires has been confirmed by the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court.  In <em>Arkansas Dept. of Human Servs. </em>v. <em>Ferrel</em>, 336 Ark. 297, 984 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 807 (1999), the court refused to endorse an equitable, nontextual interpretation of the statute.  Rejecting a Medicaid recipient\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he ought to retain some of a settlement that was insufficient to cover both his and Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s expenses, the court explained:  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the clear, unambiguous language of the statute, it is apparent that the legislature intended that ADHS\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recoup Medicaid payments from third parties or recipients not be restricted by equitable subrogation principles such as the \xe2\x80\x98made whole\xe2\x80\x99 rule stated in [<em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Healthsource of Arkansas</em>, 328 Ark. 163, 942 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 837 (1997)].  By creating an automatic legal assignment which expressly becomes a statutory lien, [Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93307 (1991)] makes an unequivocal statement that the ADHS\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recover Medicaid payments from insurance settlements, if it so chooses, is superior to that of the recipient even when the settlement does not pay all the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s medical costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 308, 984 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 811.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the Arkansas statute, if enforceable against Ahlborn, authorizes imposition of a lien on her settlement proceeds in the amount of $215,645.30.  Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s argument before the District Court, the Eighth Circuit, and this Court has been that Arkansas law goes too far.  We agree.  Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 statute finds no support in the federal third-party liability provisions, and in fact squarely conflicts with the anti-lien provision of the federal Medicaid laws.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must decide whether ADHS can lay claim to more than the portion of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement that represents medical expenses.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The text of the federal third-party liability provisions suggests not; it focuses on recovery of payments for medical care.  Medicaid recipients must, as a condition of eligibility, \xe2\x80\x9cassign the State any rights . . . <em>to payment for medical care</em> from any third party,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396k(a) (1)(A) (emphasis added), not rights to payment for, for example, lost wages.  The other statutory language that ADHS relies upon is not to the contrary; indeed, it reinforces the limitation implicit in the assignment provision.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, ADHS points to \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that States \xe2\x80\x9cseek reimbursement for [medical] assistance <em>to the extent of such legal liability</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) and suggests that this means that the entirety of a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s settlement is fair game.  In fact, as is evident from the context of the emphasized language, \xe2\x80\x9csuch legal liability\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal liability of third parties . . . <em>to pay for care and services available under the plan</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(A) (emphasis added).  Here, the tortfeasor has accepted liability for only one-sixth of the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s overall damages, and ADHS has stipulated that only $35,581.47 of that sum represents compensation for medical expenses.  Under the circumstances, the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cliability\xe2\x80\x9d extends no further than that amount.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, ADHS argues that the language of \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H) favors its view that it can demand full reimbursement of its costs from Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement.  That provision, which echoes the requirement of a mandatory assignment of rights in \xc2\xa71396k(a), says that the State must have in effect laws that, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual,\xe2\x80\x9d give the State the right to recover from liable third parties.  This must mean, says ADHS, that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s recovery is limited only by the amount it paid out on the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s behalf\xe2\x80\x94and not by the third-party tortfeasor\xe2\x80\x99s particular liability for medical expenses.  But that reading ignores the rest of the provision, which makes clear that the State must be assigned \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of [the recipient] to payment by any other party <em>for such health care items or services</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H) (emphasis added).  Again, the statute does not sanction an assignment of rights to payment for anything other than medical expenses\xe2\x80\x94not lost wages, not pain and suffering, not an inheritance.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, ADHS points to the provision requiring that, where the State actively pursues recovery from the third party, Medicaid be reimbursed fully from \xe2\x80\x9cany amount collected by the State under an assignment\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cthe remainder of such amount collected\xe2\x80\x9d is remitted to the recipient.  \xc2\xa71396k(b).  In ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 view, this shows that the State must be paid in full from any settlement.  See Brief for Petitioners 13.  But, even assuming the provision applies in cases where the State does not actively participate in the litigation, ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion rests on a false premise: The \xe2\x80\x9camount recovered \xe2\x80\xa6 under an assignment\xe2\x80\x9d is not, as ADHS assumes, the entire settlement; as explained above, under the federal statute the State\xe2\x80\x99s assigned rights extend only to recovery of payments for medical care.  Accordingly, what \xc2\xa71396k(b) requires is that the State be paid first out of any damages representing payments for medical care before the recipient can recover any of her own costs for medical care.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the very least, then, the federal third-party liability provisions <em>require</em> an assignment of no more than the right to recover that portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  They did not mandate the enactment of the Arkansas scheme that we have\ndescribed.   </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If there were no other relevant provisions in the federal statute, the State might plausibly argue that federal law supplied a recovery \xe2\x80\x9cfloor\xe2\x80\x9d upon which States were free to build.  In fact, though, the federal statute places express limits on the State\xe2\x80\x99s powers to pursue recovery of funds it paid on the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  These limitations are contained in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(18) and 1396p.  Section 1396a(a)(18) requires that a State Medicaid plan comply with \xc2\xa71396p, which in turn prohibits States (except in circumstances not relevant here) from placing liens against, or seeking recovery of benefits paid from, a Medicaid recipient:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) Imposition of lien against property of an individual on account of medical assistance rendered to him under a State plan</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) No lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the State plan, except\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual, or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) [in certain circumstances not relevant here] \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) Adjustment or recovery of medical assistance correctly paid under a State plan</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) No adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made, except [in circumstances not relevant here].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396p.</p>\n<p align="left">\nRead literally and in isolation, the anti-lien prohibition contained in \xc2\xa71396p(a) would appear to ban even a lien on that portion of the settlement proceeds that represents payments for medical care.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Ahlborn does not ask us to go so far, though; she assumes that the State\xe2\x80\x99s lien is consistent with federal law insofar as it encumbers proceeds designated as payments for medical care.  Her argument, rather, is that the anti-lien provision precludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the\nsettlement. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree.  There is no question that the State can require an assignment of the right, or chose in action, to receive payments for medical care.  So much is expressly provided for by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(25) and 1396k(a).  And we assume, as do the parties, that the State can also demand as a condition of Medicaid eligibility that the recipient \xe2\x80\x9cassign\xe2\x80\x9d in advance any payments that may constitute reimbursement for medical costs.  To the extent that the forced assignment is expressly authorized by the terms of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(25) and 1396k(a), it is an exception to the anti-lien provision.  See <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v.<em> Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 383\xe2\x80\x93385, and n. 7 (2003).  But that does not mean that the State can force an assignment of, or place a lien on, any other portion of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s property.  As explained above, the exception carved out by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(25) and 1396k(a) is limited to payments for medical care.  Beyond that, the anti-lien provision applies.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ADHS tries to avoid the anti-lien provision by characterizing the settlement proceeds as not Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Its argument appears to be that the automatic assignment effected by the Arkansas statute rendered the proceeds the property of the State.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  See Brief for Petitioners 31 (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder Arkansas law, the lien does not attach to the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99 because it attaches only to those proceeds already assigned to the Department as a condition of Medicaid eligibility\xe2\x80\x9d).  That argument fails for two reasons.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, ADHS insists that Ahlborn at all times until judgment retained her entire chose in action\xe2\x80\x94a right that included her claim for medical damages.  The statutory lien, then, cannot have attached until the proceeds materialized.  That much is clear from the text of the Arkansas statute, which says that the \xe2\x80\x9cassignment shall be considered a statutory lien on any settlement . . . <em>received by the recipient from a third party</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x9377\xe2\x80\x93307(c) (2001) (emphasis added).  The settlement is not \xe2\x80\x9creceived\xe2\x80\x9d until the chose in action has been reduced to proceeds in Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  Accordingly, the assertion that any of the proceeds belonged to the State all along lacks merit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Ahlborn lost her property rights in the proceeds the instant she applied for medical assistance is inconsistent with the creation of a statutory lien on those proceeds.  Why, after all, would ADHS need a lien on its own property?  A lien typically is imposed on the property of <em>another</em> for payment of a debt owed by that other.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 922 (6th ed. 1990).  Nothing in the Arkansas statute defines the term otherwise. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the lien is also called an \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d does not alter the analysis.  The terms that Arkansas employs to describe the mechanism by which it lays claim to the settlement proceeds do not, by themselves, tell us whether the statute violates the anti-lien provision.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Craft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/274/index.html">535 U. S. 274</a>, 279 (2002); <em>Drye</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/49/index.html">528 U. S. 49</a>, 58\xe2\x80\x9361 (1999).  Although denominated an \xe2\x80\x9cassignment,\xe2\x80\x9d the effect of the statute here was not to divest Ahlborn of all her property interest; instead, Ahlborn retained the right to sue for medical care payments, and the State asserted a right to the fruits of that suit once they materialized.  In effect, and as at least some of the statutory language recognizes, Arkansas has imposed a lien on Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s property.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since none of the federal third-party liability provisions excepts that lien from operation of the anti-lien provision, its imposition violates federal law.  </p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ADHS and its <em>amici</em> urge, however, that even if a lien on more than medical damages would violate federal law in some cases, a rule permitting such a lien ought to apply here either because Ahlborn breached her duty to \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate\xe2\x80\x9d with ADHS or because there is an inherent danger of manipulation in cases where the parties to a tort case settle without judicial oversight or input from the State.  Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States proposes a default rule of full reimbursement whenever the recipient breaches her duty to \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate,\xe2\x80\x9d and asserts that Ahlborn in fact breached that duty.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  But, even if the Government\xe2\x80\x99s allegations of obstruction were supported by the record, its conception of the duty to cooperate strays far beyond the text of the statute and the relevant regulations.  The duty to cooperate arises principally, if not exclusively, in proceedings initiated <em>by the State</em> to recover from third parties.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396k(a)(1)(C) (recipients must \xe2\x80\x9ccooperate with the State in identifying . . . and providing information to assist the State in pursuing\xe2\x80\x9d third parties).  Most of the accompanying federal regulations simply echo this basic duty; all they add is that the recipient must \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ay to the agency any support or medical care funds received that are covered by the assignment of rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 CFR \xc2\xa7433.147(b)(4) (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n      In any event, the aspersions the United States casts upon Ahlborn are entirely unsupported; all the record reveals is that ADHS, despite having intervened in the lawsuit and asked to be apprised of any hearings, neither asked to be nor was involved in the settlement negotiations.  Whatever the bounds of the duty to cooperate, there is no evidence that it was breached here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 alternative argument that a rule of full reimbursement is needed generally to avoid the risk of settlement manipulation is more colorable, but ultimately also unpersuasive.  The issue is not, of course, squarely presented here; ADHS has stipulated that only $35,581.47 of Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement proceeds properly are designated as payments for medical costs.  Even in the absence of such a post-settlement agreement, though, the risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest can be avoided either by obtaining the State\xe2\x80\x99s advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  For just as there are risks in underestimating the value of readily calculable damages in settlement negotiations, so also is there a countervailing concern that a rule of absolute priority might preclude settlement in a large number of cases, and be unfair to the recipient in others.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, ADHS contends that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision below accords insufficient weight to two decisions by the Departmental Appeals Board of HHS (Board) rejecting appeals by the States of California and Washington from denial of reimbursement for costs those States paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients who had settled tort claims.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 45\xe2\x80\x9367 (reproducing <em>In\xc2\xa0re Washington State Dept. of Social &amp; Health Servs.,</em> Dec. No. 1561, 1996 WL 157123 (HHS Dept. App. Bd., Feb. 7, 1996)); App. to Pet. for Cert. 68\xe2\x80\x9386 (reproducing <em>In\xc2\xa0re California Dept. of Health Servs.</em>, Dec. No. 1504, 1995 WL 66334 (HHS Dept. App. Bd., Jan. 5, 1995)).  Because the opinions in those cases address a different question from the one posed here, make no mention of the anti-lien provision, and, in any event, rest on a questionable construction of the federal third-party liability provisions, we conclude that they do not control our analysis. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Normally, if a State recovers from a third party the cost of Medicaid benefits paid on behalf of a recipient, the Federal Government owes the State no reimbursement, and any funds already paid by the Federal Government must be returned.  See 42 CFR \xc2\xa7433.140(a)(2) (2005) (federal financial participation \xe2\x80\x9cis not available in Medicaid payments if . . . [t]he agency received reimbursement from a liable third party\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7433.140(c).  Washington and California both had adopted schemes according to which the State refrained from claiming full reimbursement from tort settlements and instead took only a portion of each settlement.  (In California, the recipient typically could keep at least 50% of her settlement, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 72; in Washington, the proportion varied from case to case, see <em>id.</em>, at 48\xe2\x80\x9351.)  Each scheme resulted in the State\xe2\x80\x99s having to pay a portion of the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s medical costs\xe2\x80\x94a portion for which the State sought partial reimbursement from the Federal Government.  CMS (then called HCFA) denied this partial reimbursement on the ground that the States had an absolute duty to seek full payment of medical expenses from third-party tortfeasors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board upheld CMS\xe2\x80\x99 determinations.  In California\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, which came first, the Board concluded that the State\xe2\x80\x99s duty to seek recovery of benefits \xe2\x80\x9cfrom available third party sources to the fullest extent possible\xe2\x80\x9d included demanding full reimbursement from the entire proceeds of a Medicaid recipient\xe2\x80\x99s tort settlement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 76.  The Board acknowledged that \xc2\xa71396k(a) \xe2\x80\x9crefers to assignment only of \xe2\x80\x98payment for medical care,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but thought that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory scheme as a whole contemplates that the actual recovery might be greater and, if it is, that Medicaid should be paid first.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Board gave two other reasons for siding with CMS: First, the legislative history of the third-party liability evinced a congressional intent that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Medicaid program . . . be reimbursed from available third party sources to the fullest extent possible,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> and, second, California had long been on notice that it would not be reimbursed for any shortfall resulting from failure to fully recoup Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s costs from tort settlements, see <em>id.</em>, at 77.  The Board also opined that the State could not escape its duty to seek full reimbursement by relying on the Medicaid recipient\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in litigating her claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 79\xe2\x80\x9380.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, responding to the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that its scheme gave Medicaid recipients incentives to sue third-party tortfeasors and thus resulted in both greater recovery and lower costs for the State, the Board observed that \xe2\x80\x9ca state is free to allow recipients to retain the state\xe2\x80\x99s share\xe2\x80\x9d of any recovery, so long as it does not compromise the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s share.  <em>Id.</em>, at 85.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board reached the same conclusion, by the same means, in the Washington case.  See <em>id.</em>, at 53\xe2\x80\x9364.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither of these adjudications compels us to conclude that Arkansas\xe2\x80\x99 statutory lien comports with federal law.  First, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s rulings address a different question from the one presented here.  The Board was concerned with the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to reimburse States that had, in its view, failed to seek full recovery of Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s costs and had instead relied on recipients to act as private attorneys general.  The Board neither discussed nor even so much as cited the federal anti-lien provision.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment that the assignment of rights required by \xc2\xa71396k(a) is limited to payments for medical care only reinforces the clarity of the statutory language.  Moreover, its resort to \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory scheme as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d as justification for muddying that clarity is nowhere explained.  Given that the only statutory provisions CMS relied on are \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396a(a)(25), 1396k(a), and 1396k(b), see <em>id.</em>, at 75\xe2\x80\x9376; <em>id.</em>, at 54\xe2\x80\x9355, and given the Board\xe2\x80\x99s concession that the first two of these limit the State\xe2\x80\x99s assignment to payments for medical care, the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d must mean \xc2\xa71396k(b).  But that provision does not authorize the State to demand reimbursement from portions of the settlement allocated or allocable to nonmedical damages; instead, it gives the State a priority disbursement from the medical expenses portion alone.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  In fact, in its adjudication in the Washington case, the Board conceded as much: \xe2\x80\x9c[CMS] may require a state to assert a collection priority over funds obtained by Medicaid recipients in [third-party liability] suits <em>even though the distribution methodology set forth in section [1396k(b)] refers only to payments collected pursuant to assignments for medical care</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 54 (emphasis added).  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning therefore is internally inconsistent.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on legislative history is misplaced.  The Board properly observed that Congress, in crafting the Medicaid legislation, intended that Medicaid be a \xe2\x80\x9cpayer of last resort.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93146, p. 313 (1985).  That does not mean, however, that Congress meant to authorize States to seek reimbursement from Medicaid recipients themselves; in fact, with the possible exception of a lien on payments for medical care, the statute expressly prohibits liens against the property of Medicaid beneficiaries.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396p(a).  We recognize that Congress has delegated \xe2\x80\x9cbroad regulatory authority to the Secretary [of HHS] in the Medicaid area,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. </em>v. <em>Blumer, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/473/index.html">534 U. S. 473</a>, 496, n. 13 (2002), and that agency adjudications typically warrant deference.  Here, however, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning couples internal inconsistency with a conscious disregard for the statutory text.  Under these circumstances, we decline to treat the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning as controlling.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal Medicaid law does not authorize ADHS to assert a lien on Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s settlement in an amount exceeding $35,581.47, and the federal anti-lien provision affirmatively prohibits it from doing so.

Cf. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71396k(a)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C) (the recipient has a duty to identify liable third parties and to \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] information to <em>assist the State in pursuing</em>\xe2\x80\x9d those parties (emphasis added)).</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The effect of the stipulation is the same as if a trial judge had found that Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s damages amounted to $3,040,708.12 (of which $215,645.30 were for medical expenses), but because of her contributory negligence, she could only recover one-sixth of those damages. </p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Implicit in ADHS\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of this provision is the assumption that there can be no \xe2\x80\x9cremainder\xe2\x80\x9d to remit to the Medicaid recipient if all the State has been assigned is the right to damages for medical expenses.  That view in turn seems to rest on an assumption either that Medicaid will have paid all the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s medical expenses or that Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s expenses will always exceed the portion of any third-party recovery earmarked for medical expenses.   Neither assumption holds up.  First, as both the Solicitor General and CMS acknowledge, the recipient often will have paid medical expenses out of her own pocket.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12 (under \xc2\xa71396k(b), \xe2\x80\x9cthe beneficiary retains the right to payment for any additional medical expenses personally incurred either before or subsequent to Medicaid eligibility and for other damages\xe2\x80\x9d); CMS, State Medicaid Manual \xc2\xa73907 (last modified Sept. 16, 2005) (envisioning that \xe2\x80\x9cmedical insurance payments,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, will be remitted to the recipient if possible).  Second, even if Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s outlays often exceed the portion of the recovery earmarked for medical expenses in tort cases, the third-party liability provisions were not drafted exclusively with tort settlements in mind.  In the case of health insurance, for example, the funds available under the policy may be enough to cover both Medicaid\xe2\x80\x99s costs and the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s own medical expenses.   </p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0ADHS concedes that, had a jury or judge allocated a sum for medical payments out of a larger award in this case, the agency would be entitled to reimburse itself only from the portion so allocated.

Given the stipulation between ADHS and Ahlborn, there is no textual basis for treating the settlement here differently from a judge-allocated settlement or even a jury award; all such awards typically establish a third party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cliability\xe2\x80\x9d for both \xe2\x80\x9cpayment for medical care\xe2\x80\x9d and other heads of damages.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Likewise, subsection (b) would appear to forestall any attempt by the State to recover benefits paid, at least from the \xe2\x80\x9cindividual.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Martin ex rel.

The Eighth Circuit thought this would be impermissible because the State cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvent the restrictions of the federal anti-lien statute simply by requiring an applicant for Medicaid benefits to assign property rights to the State before the applicant liquidates the property to a sum certain.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 6.  Indeed, ADHS acknowledges that Arkansas cannot, for example, require a Medicaid applicant to assign in advance any right she may have to recover an inheritance or an award in a civil case not related to her injuries or medical care.
