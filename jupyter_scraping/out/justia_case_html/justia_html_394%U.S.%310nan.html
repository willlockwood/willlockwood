United States, Ivanov v. United States, and Butenko v. United States, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span>.  It is not evident from the records in some of these cases whether the surveillances at issue were unlawful.  It may be that the overhearings in some instances were not achieved by trespass, <em>see Katz v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/case.html">389 U. S. 347</a></span> (1967); <em>Desist v. United States, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/case.html">394 U. S. 244</a></span>, and <em>Kaiser v. New York, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/280/case.html">394 U. S. 280</a></span>, or for some other reasons were not unlawful.  As we held in <em>Alderman, Ivanov,</em> and <em>Butenko, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html#170">394 U. S. 170</a></span>, n. 3, "the District Court must develop the relevant facts and decide if the Government\'s electronic surveillance </l=></p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 394 U. S. 313</a></p><p> was unlawful."  Of course, a finding by the District Court that the surveillance was lawful would make disclosure and further proceedings unnecessary.  Similarly, it is not clear that each petitioner has standing to assert the illegality of the surveillance or of the introduction of its fruits.  As in <em>Alderman, Ivanov,</em> and <em>Butenko,</em> these issues are to be resolved by the District Courts in the first instance.</p>\n<p>MR.

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.</p>\n<p>A few words in amplification of this per curiam opinion may help to avoid misunderstanding on the part of the litigants, and of the District Courts to which these cases are remanded.</p>\n<p>As we made explicit in <em>Alderman, Butenko,</em> and <em>Ivanov,</em> the requirement that certain products of governmental electronic surveillance be turned over to defense counsel was expressly limited to situations where the surveillance had violated the Fourth Amendment.  We did not decide in those cases, and we do not decide in these, that any of the surveillances <em>did</em> violate the Fourth Amendment. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 394 U. S. 314</a></p><p> Instead, we have left that threshold question for the District Courts to decide in all these cases.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we did not in <em>Alderman, Butenko,</em> or <em>Ivanov,</em> and we do not today, specify the procedure that the District Courts are to follow in making this preliminary determination.  We have nowhere indicated that this determination cannot appropriately be made in <em>ex parte, in camera</em> proceedings.</p>\n<p>"Nothing in <em>Alderman v. United States, Ivanov v. United States,</em> or <em>Butenko v. United States, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span>, requires an adversary proceeding and full disclosure for resolution of every issue raised by an electronic surveillance."</p>\n<p><em>Taglianetti v. United States, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/316/case.html">394 U. S. 316</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court has not in any of these cases addressed itself to the standards governing the constitutionality of electronic surveillance relating to the gathering of foreign intelligence information -- necessary for the conduct of international affairs, and for the protection of national defense secrets and installations from foreign espionage and sabotage.  MR. JUSTICE WHITE </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 394 U. S. 315</a></p><p> has elsewhere made clear his view that such surveillance does not violate the Fourth Amendment,</p>\n<p>"if the President of the United States or his chief legal officer, the Attorney General, has considered the requirements of national security and authorized electronic surveillance as reasonable. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>While two members of the Court have indicated disagreement with that view, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the issue remains open. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>One might suppose that all of this should be entirely clear to any careful reader of the Court\'s opinion in <em>Alderman, Butenko,</em> and <em>Ivanov.</em>  Perhaps so, and perhaps, therefore, what I have said is quite unnecessary.  But 10 years of experience here have taught me that the most carefully written opinions are not always carefully read -- even by those most directly concerned.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>In oral argument of the <em>Butenko</em> and <em>Ivanov</em> cases, the Solicitor General, mystifyingly, sought to concede that the surveillances there <em>were</em> in fact, unconstitutional, although he was repeatedly invited to argue that they were not.  The following colloquies during oral argument of the <em>Ivanov</em> case are illustrative:</p>\n<p>"Q. Are you asking us to decide here or to leave open on remand the question as to whether this violates, this bugging in this particular case, violates the Fourth Amendment?"</p>\n<p>"A. Our position would be the same had it or not.  We are not arguing that it did not violate the Fourth Amendment."</p>\n<p>"Q. In other words, the premise in which you are proceeding here is that you admit for the purposes of this case that this was illegal bugging?"</p>\n<p>"A. Yes, Mr. Justice."</p>\n<p>"Q. And you are going to remain free to argue to the district judge that there was no violation?"</p>\n<p>"A. No, sir."</p>\n<p>In deciding those cases, the Court declined to accept the Solicitor General\'s proffered concession.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Katz v.
