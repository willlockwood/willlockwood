S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), 846.  At sentencing, the District Court determined that the drug quantities attributable to Spears yielded an offense level of 38, that his criminal history justified placing him in the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 criminal history category IV, and that the resulting advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 324 to 405 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  The District Court was of the view that the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 100:1 ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine quantities, see<em> </em>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2006) (USSG),*<footcall num="*"> yielded an excessive sentence in light of the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  Relying in part on decisions from other District Courts, see<em> United States</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, 389 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 278, 307\xe2\x80\x93308 (RI 2005); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 771, 781\xe2\x80\x93782 (ED Wis. 2005), which in turn relied on a report from the Sentencing Commission criticizing the 100:1 ratio, see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 106\xe2\x80\x93107, App. A, pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936 (May 2002) (hereinafter Report to Congress), the District Court recalculated Spears\xe2\x80\x99 offense level based on a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio.  That yielded an offense level of 34 and a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  The District Court sentenced Spears to 240 months in prison, the statutory mandatory minimum.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Spears</em>, 469 F.\xc2\xa03d 1166, 1173\xe2\x80\x931174 (CA8 2006) (en banc) <em>(Spears I)</em>.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On cross-appeal, the Government argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court erred by categorically rejecting the 100:1 quantity ratio and substituting its own ratio in calculating Spears\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1174.  The Eighth Circuit reversed Spears\xe2\x80\x99 sentence and remanded for resentencing, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cneither <em>Booker</em> nor \xc2\xa73553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the 100:1 quantity ratio and use a different ratio in sentencing defendants for crack cocaine offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1176.  This Court vacated the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).  <em>Spears</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Eighth Circuit again reversed Spears\xe2\x80\x99 sentence and remanded for resentencing.  533 F.\xc2\xa03d 715, 716 (2008) (en banc) <em>(Spears II)</em>.  It concluded, again, that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cmay not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 717, and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impermissibly varied by <em>replacing</em> the 100:1 quantity ratio inherent in the advisory Guidelines range with a 20:1 quantity ratio,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Spears I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1178).  Spears again petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  Because the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision on remand conflicts with our decision in <em>Kimbrough</em>, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Kimbrough</em>, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cunder <em>Booker</em>, the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only,\xe2\x80\x9d 552 U. S.<em>,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2), and that \xe2\x80\x9cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \xe2\x80\x98greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x99 to achieve \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, <em>even in a mine-run case</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 21) (emphasis added).  The correct interpretation of that holding is the one offered by the dissent in <em>Spears II:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court thus established that even when a particular defendant in a crack cocaine case presents no special mitigating circumstances\xe2\x80\x94no outstanding service to country or community, no unusually disadvantaged childhood, no overstated criminal history score, no post-offense rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94a sentencing court may nonetheless vary downward from the advisory guideline range.  The court may do so based solely on its view that the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentencing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine creates \xe2\x80\x98an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of \xc2\xa73553(a),\xe2\x80\x99 and is \xe2\x80\x98at odds with \xc2\xa73553(a).\xe2\x80\x99  The only fact necessary to justify such a variance is the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement with the guidelines\xe2\x80\x94its policy view that the 100-to-1 ratio creates an unwarranted disparity.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 719 (opinion of Colloton, J.) (citations omitted).</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kimbrough</em> considered and rejected the position taken by the Eighth Circuit below.  It noted that \xe2\x80\x9ca district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \xe2\x80\x98outside the \xe2\x80\x9cheartland\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321) (quoting <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/338/index.html">551 U. S. 338</a>, 351 (2007)).  The implication was that an \xe2\x80\x9cinside the heartland\xe2\x80\x9d departure (which is necessarily based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines and necessarily disagrees on a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical basis\xe2\x80\x9d) may be entitled to less respect.  Our opinion said, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9ccrack cocaine Guidelines \xe2\x80\xa6 present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  <em>Kimbrough</em> thus holds that with respect to the crack cocaine Guidelines, a categorical disagreement with and variance from the Guidelines is not suspect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That was indeed the point of <em>Kimbrough:</em> a recognition of district courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to vary from the crack cocaine Guidelines based on <em>policy</em> disagreement with them, and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.  The latter proposition was already established pre-<em>Kimbrough</em>, see<em> United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 245\xe2\x80\x93246 (2005), and the Government conceded as much in <em>Kimbrough</em>.  552 U. S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa013 (slip op., at 13, n.\xc2\xa013).  That the Government did not prevail in <em>Kimbrough</em> proves that its concession\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat a district court may vary from the 100:1 ratio if it does so \xe2\x80\x98based on the individualized circumstance[s]\xe2\x80\x99 of a particular case,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94understated the extent of district courts\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing discretion.<font super="1"> </font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In drawing a distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized, case-specific\xe2\x80\x9d consideration of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 ratio and categorical rejection and replacement of that ratio, the Eighth Circuit relied in part, <em>Spears II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 717, on the following passage from <em>Kimbrough:</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe [district] court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own.  Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s overarching instruction to \xe2\x80\x98impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\xe2\x80\x99 to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis says that it was \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d for the District Court in <em>Kimbrough</em> not to specify what ratio it was using, but merely to proceed with \xc2\xa73553(a) analysis.  The Eighth Circuit read that to mean that district courts, in the course of their individualized determinations, <em>may not categorically disagree with the Guidelines ratio, and (consequently) may not substitute their own ratio for that of the Guidelines</em>.  If it meant that, our vacating of the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Spears I </em>would have been inexplicable, because that supposedly impermissible disagreement and substitution was precisely the reason for <em>Spears I</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reversal of the District Court.  See <em>Spears I</em>, 469 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1175\xe2\x80\x931176.  As a logical matter, of course, rejection of the 100:1 ratio, explicitly approved by <em>Kimbrough</em>, necessarily implies adoption of some other ratio to govern the mine-run case.  A sentencing judge who is given the power to reject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ratio must also possess the power to apply a different ratio which, in his judgment, corrects the disparity.  Put simply, the ability to reduce a mine-run defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence necessarily permits adoption of a replacement ratio.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent the above quoted language has obscured <em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, we now clarify that district courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the crack-cocaine Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those Guidelines.  Here, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s choice of replacement ratio was based upon two well-reasoned decisions by other courts, which themselves reflected the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s expert judgment that a 20:1 ratio would be appropriate in a mine-run case.  See <em>Perry</em>, 389 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308; <em>Smith</em>, 359 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 781\xe2\x80\x93782; Report to Congress 106\xe2\x80\x93107, App. A, pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The alternative approach\xe2\x80\x94adopted by the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x94would likely yield one of two results.  Either district courts would treat the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 policy embodied in the crack-to-powder ratio as mandatory, believing that they are not entitled to vary based on \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical\xe2\x80\x9d policy disagreements with the Guidelines, or they would continue to vary, masking their categorical policy disagreements as \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  The latter is institutionalized subterfuge.  The former contradicts our holding in <em>Kimbrough</em>.  Neither is an acceptable sentencing practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In opposing Spears\xe2\x80\x99 present petition for a writ of certiorari, the Government contends that the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion stands only for the noncontroversial proposition that a remand for resentencing was warranted in this case because the District Court did not properly consider all of the \xc2\xa73553(a) sentencing factors.  Brief in Opposition 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But the Government did not present that argument below, and the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion plainly did not rest on that ground.  It concluded instead that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spears</em> <em>II</em>, 533 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 717.  The Eighth Circuit has since read its own opinion to mean what it says, see<em> United States</em> v. <em>Judon</em>, 284 Fed. Appx. 371, 372 (2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and so do we.  In any event, to the extent the District Court cut short its sentencing analysis, it did so only because it had already determined that a mandatory minimum sentence was required, thus mooting any further arguments for a reduced sentence.  The decision not to entertain pointless arguments hardly constitutes procedural error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent contends, <em>post</em>, at 1, that the Eighth Circuit recognized <em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>core holding when it stated that in conducting \xe2\x80\x9can <em>individualized assessment</em> based upon the particular circumstances of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case, a district court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spears II</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 717.  But that was not <em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding; it was the <em>Government\xe2\x80\x99s</em> position in <em>Kimbrough</em>, which did not prevail.  And it is expressly contradicted by <em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that district courts are entitled to vary from the crack-cocaine guidelines in a mine-run case where there are no \xe2\x80\x9cparticular circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d that would otherwise justify a variance from the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent believes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his petition involves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts that do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may adopt their own <em>categorical </em>crack-powder ratios in place of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1.  But that is in fact not distinct from the issue we addressed in <em>Kimbrough</em>.  To say that the judge who considers the 100:1 ratio excessive cannot apply a different ratio is to say that the <em>Kimbrough</em>-sanctioned district-court disagreement with the 100:1 ratio cannot honestly be given effect.  It is absurd to think that a sentence which is reasonable in light of the statutory sentencing factors, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a), becomes unreasonable if the sentencing judge chooses to specify his disagreement, and the degree of his disagreement, with the 100:1 ratio, which is the entire basis for his Guidelines departure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent says that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Apprendi, Booker</em>, <em>Rita</em>, <em>Gall</em>, and <em>Kimbrough</em> have given the lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively short period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 3.  True enough\xe2\x80\x94and we should therefore promptly remove from the menu the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s offering, a smuggled-in dish that is indigestible.  Finally, the dissent points out that other courts have followed the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s course, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, 537 F.\xc2\xa03d 6, 11 (CA1 2008); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gunter</em>, 527 F.\xc2\xa03d 282, 286 (CA3 2008).  Both of those courts, like the Eighth Circuit, seized upon the language from <em>Kimbrough </em>quoted above in order to stand by the course they had adopted pre-<em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x94and in the case of the First Circuit, despite this Court\xe2\x80\x99s having vacated and remanded, in light of <em>Kimbrough,</em> the prior First Circuit judgment which had established that course.  See <em>Pho</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  If the error of those opinions is, as we think, evident, they demonstrate the need to clarify at once the holding of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis</em> are granted.

As explained by the majority here and the dissenting judges below, there are cogent arguments that the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was contrary to our decision last Term in <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).  But I do not think any error is so apparent as to warrant the bitter medicine of summary reversal, and I think there are good reasons not to address the question presented at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the decision below, the Court of Appeals recognized <em>Kimbrough</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>core holding that district courts have authority to depart from the Guidelines based on policy concerns:  \xe2\x80\x9cIn considering the overall goals of sentencing under [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa73553(a) and conducting an <em>individualized assessment</em> based upon the particular circumstances of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case, a district court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 F.\xc2\xa03d 715, 717 (CA8 2008).<em> </em>This petition involves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts that do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may adopt their own <em>categorical</em> crack-powder ratios in place of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is at least some language in <em>Kimbrough </em>that seems to support the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holding.  In <em>Kimbrough</em>, we noted with apparent approval that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9c<em>did not purport to establish a ratio of its own</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (emphasis added).  Rather, we held, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cappropriately framed its final determination in line with \xc2\xa73553(a)\xe2\x80\x99s overarching instruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of this language.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell</em>, 537 F.\xc2\xa03d 6, 11 (CA1 2008) (emphasizing \xe2\x80\x9cthe importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing determinations, rather than a reliance on generalized ratios\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gunter</em>, 527 F.\xc2\xa03d 282, 286 (CA3 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9ca district court may not employ a \xe2\x80\x98rubber stamp\xe2\x80\x99 approach that categorically rejects the crack/powder disparity without an individualized assessment of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority cites no circuit court decision contrary to that of the Eighth Circuit in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not the stuff of summary reversal.  The majority may well be correct that its holding today <em>follows</em> from <em>Kimbrough</em>, but it is not clear to me that this result was part and parcel of the holding in that case, especially in light of the language quoted above.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, I do not believe this case meets our normal criteria for plenary consideration.  As noted, there is no split in the lower courts on the question whether a district court may replace the crack-powder ratio in the Guidelines with a categorical ratio of the court\xe2\x80\x99s own choosing.  And, as explained above, I do not think the Court of Appeals has \xe2\x80\x9cso far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory power.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Ct. Rule 10(a).  In other words, this is exactly the sort of issue that could benefit from further attention in the courts of appeals.  We should not rush to answer a novel question about the application of a one-year-old decision in the absence of a pronounced conflict among the circuits.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Apprendi</em>, <em>Booker</em>, <em>Rita</em>,<em> Gall</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em> have given the lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively short period.  We should give them some time to address the nuances of these precedents before adding new ones.  As has been said, a plant cannot grow if you constantly yank it out of the ground to see if the roots are healthy.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
