Kindler filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada.  The state trial court subsequently dismissed Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s postverdict motions because of his escape.  Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and held him in jail pending extradition.  But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time remaining at large for more than two years.  He was eventually recaptured and transferred to the United States.  Once back in this country, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the motions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s fugitive forfeiture law.  Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s claims were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.  Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court \xe2\x80\x9cif the decision of [the state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 729.  The District Court nonetheless granted Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s habeas claims.  The Third Circuit affirmed, and the Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.  It argued that the Third Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically inadequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and the Commonwealth sought review of that holding.  The Court granted that petition. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A state procedural rule is not automatically \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate\xe2\x80\x9d under the adequate state ground doctrine\xe2\x80\x94and therefore unenforceable on federal habeas review\xe2\x80\x94because the state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory.  The question whether a state procedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law.  <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/362/index.html">534 U. S. 362</a>, 375.  This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking whether the state rule was \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly established and regularly followed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 376.  A discretionary state procedural rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.  A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma for the States:\xc2\xa0They could preserve flexibility by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments.  Or States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.  If forced to choose, many States would opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.  That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are often desirable.  The federal system, for example, often grants the trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking.  The States have followed suit.  Given the federalism and comity concerns motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context, see <em>Coleman, supra,</em> at 730, this Court should not disregard discretionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal courts.

Police stopped the getaway car and arrested Shaw and Bernstein.  In a harbinger of things to come, Kindler escaped.  <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kindler</em>, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d 1, 5, cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/933/index.html"></a><a href="/us/513/933/index.html">513 U. S. 933</a> (1994).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with burglary.  He was released on bail.  Bernstein agreed to testify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans.  At about 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw attacked Bernstein outside his apartment.  Kindler beat Bernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and Shaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.  Bernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move, and Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their nearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the Delaware River.  At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block around Bernstein\xe2\x80\x99s neck and dumped him in the water.  A forensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of drowning and massive head injuries.  536 Pa., at 236\xe2\x80\x93239, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d<em>,</em> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital murder.  The jury recommended a death sentence, and Kindler filed postverdict motions.  <em>Id</em>., at 230\xe2\x80\x93231, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death recommendation, Kindler escaped.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In an organized effort to saw through the external prison bars with smuggled tools, Kindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the prison and headed for Canada.  See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kindler</em>, 554 Pa. 513, 517\xe2\x80\x93518, and n.\xc2\xa04, 722 A.\xc2\xa02d 143, 145, and n.\xc2\xa04 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26, 1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate burglary offenses.  The United States sought Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s return, but an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to hand over anyone likely to face execution.  See <em>Kindler</em> v. <em>Canada (Minister of Justice)</em>, [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler turned into something of a local celebrity.  He even appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among other things, how he had escaped and why he chose Canada: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew there was no death penalty here.\xe2\x80\x9d  CTV National News: Joseph Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s Fate Unresolved (Canadian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Canadian authorities ultimately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and agreed to extradite Kindler.  <em>Kindler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 231, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again.  On the night of October 23, 1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of the jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the skylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof, where he stood 175 feet above ground.  Armed with 13 stories\xe2\x80\x99 worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely rappelled down the side of the jail.  (A fellow escapee was not as lucky\xe2\x80\x94the sheets ripped on his way down, causing him to fall 50 feet to his death.)  <em>Kindler</em>, 554 Pa., at 517\xe2\x80\x93519, 722 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 145.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This time, Kindler remained on the lam for more than two years, until he was featured on the popular television show, \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Most Wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Characterizing Kindler as \xe2\x80\x9can above average criminal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca chess player who understands when to make his move,\xe2\x80\x9d the show asked viewers for information to help capture him.  <em>America\xe2\x80\x99s Most Wanted</em>, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at 10:01.  Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified Canadian authorities, who arrested him in September 1988.  554 Pa., at 519, 722 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 145.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler again fought extradition.  On September 16, 1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s efforts.  See <em>Kindler</em>, 2 S. C. R. 779.  That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler to the United States.  <em>Kindler </em>v. <em>Horn</em>, 291 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court had dismissed Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s postverdict motions because of his original escape.  Once back in the United States, Kindler filed a motion to reinstate those challenges to his conviction and sentence.  The trial court denied the reinstatement motion, holding that the trial court judge who had dismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused his discretion.  In October 1991\xe2\x80\x94more than seven years after the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death recommendation\xe2\x80\x94the court formally imposed the death sentence.  <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kindler</em>, No. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App. 66\xe2\x80\x9370.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  <em>Kindler</em>, 536 Pa., at 232\xe2\x80\x93234, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 3.  That court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9ctrial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive status, . . . have every right to fashion an appropriate response[,] which can include the dismissal of pending post-verdict motions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 233, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 3.<em> </em>  The court then determined that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s claims fell within its authority:  The \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable response to Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98flouting\xe2\x80\x99 of the authority of the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 233\xe2\x80\x93234, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 3.  Under Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s case therefore came to it \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any allegations of error (direct or collateral) preserved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 234, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless conducted the \xe2\x80\x9climited review\xe2\x80\x9d mandated for death sentences under Pennsylvania law.  Under that review, the court was required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of first-degree murder and at least one aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not excessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or prejudice.  <em>Id., </em>at 234\xe2\x80\x93235, 639 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 4.  Satisfied that Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s conviction met these standards, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence.  We denied certiorari.  <em>Kindler </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/933/index.html"></a><a href="/us/513/933/index.html">513 U. S. 933</a> (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  That court held that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had already ruled that Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s escape forfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence that Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kindler</em>, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App. 183, 187\xe2\x80\x93188.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  <em>Kindler</em>, 554 Pa., at 514, 722 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 143.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kindler then sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s habeas claims.  291 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 340\xe2\x80\x93343.  The District Court then proceeded to address the merits, granting Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s petition on the grounds that he was sentenced based on jury instructions that were unconstitutional under <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/367/index.html">486 U. S. 367</a> (1988), and that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggravating factor at sentencing.  291 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 346\xe2\x80\x93351, 357\xe2\x80\x93358.  The court rejected Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  <em>Id</em>., at 356.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit affirmed.  That court began by recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied in the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal habeas review even if state courts are willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief where the rule would otherwise apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kindler </em>v. <em>Horn</em>, 542 F.\xc2\xa03d 70, 79 (2008).  The Court of Appeals then considered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place at the time of Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s first escape: \xe2\x80\x9cPennsylvania courts had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who had been returned to custody before an appeal was initiated or dismissed\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture rule was not \xe2\x80\x98firmly established\xe2\x80\x99 and therefore was not an independent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to bar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (citing <em>Doctor </em>v. <em>Walters</em>, 96 F.\xc2\xa03d 675, 684\xe2\x80\x93686 (CA3 1996)).  The court thus determined that \xe2\x80\x9cthe state trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post-verdict motions.  Accordingly, we conclude that, under <em>Doctor</em>, Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s fugitive waiver law did not preclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the claims raised in Kindler\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em> at 80.  Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court on the improper aggravating factor claim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on his <em>Mills</em> and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  542 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>, </em>at 80\xe2\x80\x9387.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination that state discretionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with the holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.  Pet. for Cert. 6\xe2\x80\x9311.  Kindler countered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  Relying on the court\xe2\x80\x99s citation of the <em>Doctor </em>opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit did not hold that discretionary state rules are automatically inadequate; rather the court determined that the state courts applied \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>new</em> and <em>different</em> rule from that in existence at the time of the alleged default.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 3.  It was that new rule, Kindler maintained, that the Third Circuit found inadequate.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  That petition asks us to decide whether discretionary procedural rulings are automatically inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether a state procedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law.  <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/362/index.html">534 U.

We have framed the adequacy inquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98firmly established and regularly followed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 376 (quoting <em>James</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/341/index.html">466 U.

Nothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for purposes of the adequate state ground doctrine.  To the contrary, a discretionary rule can be \xe2\x80\x9cfirmly established\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cregularly followed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1128, 1140 (1986) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an important independent category under the inadequate state ground doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma for the States: States could preserve flexibility by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments.  Or States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary federal review.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for State of California et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 19; Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14.  That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are often desirable.  In some circumstances, for example, the factors facing trial courts \xe2\x80\x9care so numerous, variable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules would be more likely to impair [the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s] ability to deal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCoy</em>, 517 F.\xc2\xa02d 41, 44 (CA7) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/895/index.html">423 U.

The result would be particularly unfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the opportunity to argue that a procedural default should be excused through the exercise of judicial discretion.

S. 72</a>, 90 (1977); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Poynter</em>, 495 F.\xc2\xa03d 349, 351\xe2\x80\x93352 (CA6 2007).  The States seem to value discretionary rules as much as the Federal Government does.  See Brief for State of California et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (citing various state discretionary procedural rules).  In light of the federalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context, see <em>Coleman</em>, 501 U. S., at 730, it would seem particularly strange to disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.  Cf. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Henderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/536/index.html">425 U. S. 536</a>, 541\xe2\x80\x93542 (1976).  Even stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State, and all at one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial\xe2\x80\x94so uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the point before this Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\xe2\x80\x9331.  Rather than defending the question on which we granted certiorari\xe2\x80\x94whether discretionary rules are automatically inadequate\xe2\x80\x94Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts did not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead applied a new rule mandating dismissal.  Such a mandatory dismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past discretionary practice, and thus does not provide an adequate state ground to bar his federal claims.  We leave it to the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any others Kindler may have preserved, on remand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to reject a <em>per</em> <em>se</em> rule about discretionary rulings, but also to undertake \xe2\x80\x9c[a] new effort to state a standard for inadequacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 25.  <em>Amici</em> supporting the Commonwealth join in that request.  See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x9310.  We decline that invitation as well.  The procedural default at issue here\xe2\x80\x94escape from prison\xe2\x80\x94is hardly a typical procedural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for providing broad guidance on the adequate state ground doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the question we granted certiorari to decide is narrow.  Answering that question is sufficient unto the day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963074">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nBEARD V.

The apparent difficulty the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found in accepting the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s procedural bar conclusion, however, invites this further comment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The adequate state ground doctrine cannot be applied without consideration of the purposes it is designed to serve.  By refraining from deciding cases that rest on an adequate and independent state ground, federal courts show proper respect for state courts and avoid rendering advisory opinions.  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a>, 1040 (1983).  The claimed adequate and independent state ground at issue in this case is a state procedural rule.  We have not allowed state courts to bar review of federal claims by invoking new procedural rules without adequate notice to litigants who, in asserting their federal rights, have in good faith complied with existing state procedural law.  \xe2\x80\x9cNovelty in procedural requirements cannot be permitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Patterson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/index.html">357 U. S. 449</a>, 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (1958).  We have also been mindful of the danger that novel state procedural requirements will be imposed for the purpose of evading compliance with a federal standard.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Flowers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/288/index.html">377 U. S. 288</a>, 293\xe2\x80\x93302 (1964).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither of these concerns applies here.  First, no one could seriously entertain the notion that Kindler acted in \xe2\x80\x9cjustified reliance\xe2\x80\x9d when he fled beyond the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania courts.  Even if a hypothetical escapee studiously examined the case law before making an informed decision that flight was worth it, that is not the reliance the law should be required to consider.  There is no justification for an unlawful escape, which \xe2\x80\x9coperates as an affront to the dignity of [a] court\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ortega-Rodriguez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/234/index.html">507 U. S. 234</a>, 246 (1993).  And if some prior court rulings allowed a former escapee to reinstate forfeited claims, there is no convincing reason to say a future escapee is entitled to similar treatment.  Nor is there any indication that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania adopted its forfeiture rule out of any hostility toward legitimate constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is most doubtful that, in light of its underlying purposes, the adequate state ground doctrine ought to prevent a State from adopting, and enforcing, a sensible rule that the escaped felon forfeits any pending postverdict motions.  The law is entitled to protect the regularity and predictability of its own processes, and its own interest in the prompt adjudication of disputed issues, by imposing a rule of waiver quite without regard to some notion of express or constructive reliance by the one who escapes.  And if that principle had not been fully explicated in prior decisions, it seems to me that the State can establish a new baseline without later having its procedural bar ignored by the federal courts.  This should be true even if the principles barring the postverdict motions are first elaborated in the instant case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The process of elaborating, defining, and then shaping a State\xe2\x80\x99s decisional law after considering the competing arguments in a specific case rests on this premise: Novel facts and circumstances may disclose principles that, while consistent with the logic and rationality the law seeks and in that sense predictable, still have not yet been defined with precision in earlier cases.  This is the dynamic of the case system we rely upon to explain the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The adequate state ground doctrine ought not to foreclose the case process in the separate States.  A too-rigorous or demanding insistence that procedural requirements be established in all of their detail before they can be given effect in federal court would deprive the States of the case law decisional dynamic that the Judiciary of the United States finds necessary and appropriate for the elaboration of its own procedural rules.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/94/97/index.html">94 U. S. 97</a> (1876).  Save where there is exclusive jurisdiction or federal supremacy, a proper constitutional balance ought not give federal courts latitude in the interpretation and elaboration of its law that it then withholds from the States.  There is no sense in applying the adequate state ground rule without its being informed by these principles.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether the structure of this case either permits or requires consideration of these matters is not clear at this stage.  In a proper case, however, these concerns should be addressed.  It seems most doubtful that this Court can or should require federal courts to disregard a state procedural ground that was not in all respects explicit before the case when it was first announced, absent a showing of a purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.  And this is particularly so when the state procedural requirement arose from the necessity, in new circumstances, to prevent a travesty of the State\xe2\x80\x99s own respected system.  In this context, the objecting party ought not to have the power to block federal courts from honoring state-law determinations that were otherwise valid, enforceable, and consistent with constitutional guarantees.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
