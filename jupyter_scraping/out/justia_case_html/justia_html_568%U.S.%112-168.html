The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction but no monetary damages was not a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d under \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, and so could not receive fees.  That was error.  Because the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir- cuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision and remand for further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia Christians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in which they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the availability of abortions.  On November 3, 2005, Lefemine and about 20 other CCL members conducted such a demonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood County, South Carolina.  Citing complaints about the graphic signs, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefemine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be ticketed for breach of the peace.  Lefemine objected, asserting that the officer was violating his \n \nFirst Amendment rights, but the threat eventually caused him to disband the protest.  See Lefemine v. Davis, 732 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 614, 617\xe2\x80\x93619 (SC 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to Dan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, informing him that the group intended to return to the same site with the disputed signs.  The letter cautioned that further interference would cause Lefemine \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to pursue all avail- able legal remedies.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 619.  Chief Deputy Mike Frederick responded that the police had not previously violated Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s rights, and warned that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98should we observe any protester or demonstrator committing the same act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the same manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal sanctions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Out of fear of those sanctions, the group chose not to protest in the county for the next two years.  See ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 against several Greenwood County police officers alleging violations of his \n \nFirst Amendment rights.  Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  See 732 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 620.  Ruling on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dueling motions for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  See id., at 620\xe2\x80\x93625.  The court therefore permanently enjoined the defendants \xe2\x80\x9cfrom engaging in content-based restrictions on [Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s] display of graphic signs\xe2\x80\x9d under similar circumstances.  Id., at 627.  The court, however, refused Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s request for nominal damages, finding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the illegality of their conduct was not clearly established at the time.  See ibid.  The court as well denied Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71988, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the totality of the facts in this case the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is not warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees on the ground that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment did not make Lefemine a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71988.  672 F.\xc2\xa03d 292, 302\xe2\x80\x93303 (2012).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The court reasoned that the relief awarded did not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98alte[r] the relative positions of the parties\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d: The injunction prohibited only \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful, but not legitimate, conduct by the defendant[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and merely \xe2\x80\x9cordered [d]efendants to comply with the law and safeguard [Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s] constitutional rights in the future.  No other damages were awarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

S. C. \xc2\xa71988, allows \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in certain civil rights actions, including suits brought under \xc2\xa71983, to recover \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  A plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cprevails,\xe2\x80\x9d we have held, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  Farrar v. Hobby, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n\xe2\x80\x93112 (1992).  And we have repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory judgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that test.  See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, \n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n4 (1988)\n (per curiam).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder these established standards, Lefemine was a prevailing party.  Lefemine desired to conduct demonstrations in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant police officers had told him he could not carry.  He brought this suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself from the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 standing threat of sanctions.  And he succeeded in removing that threat.  The District Court held that the defendants had violated Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s rights and enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the future.  Contrary to the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, that ruling worked the requisite material alteration in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 relationship.  Before the ruling, the police intended to stop Lefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling, the police could not prevent him from demonstrating in that manner.  So when the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cordered [d]efendants to comply with the law,\xe2\x80\x9d 672 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 303, the relief given\xe2\x80\x94as in the usual case involving such an injunction\xe2\x80\x94supported the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause Lefemine is a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party,\xe2\x80\x9d he \xe2\x80\x9cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hensley v. Eckerhart, \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424, \n429 (1983)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither of the courts below addressed whether any special circumstances exist in this case, and we do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on which the police officers could contest liability for fees is not a question before us.  Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The defendants did not appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that they had violated Lefemine\xe2\x80\x99s \n  rights, so the Court of Appeals took as a given that a violation had occurred.
