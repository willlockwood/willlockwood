Lockett, supra, 438 U.S., at 601 (plurality opinion ), quoting Woodson v.

In State v. Wood, 648 P.2d 71, 83 (Utah 1982), that court wrote: </p><p> "It is our conclusion that the appropriate standard to be followed by the sentencing authority-judge or jury-in a capital case is the following: </p><p> \'After considering the totality of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, you must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and you must further be persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.\' </p><p> "These standards require that the sentencing body compare the totality of the mitigating against the totality of the aggravating factors, not in terms of the relative numbers of the aggravating and the mitigating factors, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1058">Page 459 U.S. 1056 , 1058</a></p><p> but in terms of their respective substantiality and persuasiveness. Basically, what the sentencing authority must decide is how compelling or persuasive the totality of the mitigating factors are when compared against the totality of the aggravating factors. The sentencing body, in making the judgment that aggravating factors \'outweigh,\' or are more compelling than, the mitigating factors, must have no reasonable doubt as to that conclusion, and as to the additional conclusion that the death penalty is justified and appropriate after considering all the circumstances." (Emphasis added). </p><p> The petitions for certiorari in these three cases request the Court to review the decision of the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirming the death penalty in each case. I do not criticize the Court\'s action in denying certiorari because the question whether the instructions to the juries are consistent with Lockett remains open for consideration in collateral proceedings. Moreover, even if relief may not be warranted in these cases, the North Carolina judiciary may find it appropriate to make slight changes in the form of its instructions to avoid the ambiguity I have identified. </p><p></p><p> Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL dissenting. </p><p> Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U.S. 153</a>, 227, 231, 2950, 2973 (1976), we would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentences in these cases. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> "There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. </p><p> But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant\'s character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments." <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U.S. 586, 605</a>, 2965 (1978) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
