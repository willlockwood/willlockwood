The Act prescribes requirements that a State must meet in order to remove a name on change-of-residence grounds, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(b), (c), (d).  The most relevant of these are found in subsection (d), which provides that a State may not remove a name on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant either (A) confirms in writing that he or she has moved or (B) fails to return a preaddressed, postage prepaid \xe2\x80\x9creturn card\xe2\x80\x9d containing statutorily prescribed content and then fails to vote in any election during the period covering the next two general federal elections.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In addition to these specific change-of-residence requirements, the NVRA also contains a general \xe2\x80\x9cFailure-to-Vote Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa720507(b)(2), consisting of two parts.  It first provides that a state removal program \xe2\x80\x9cshall not result in the removal of the name of any person\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0by reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, as added by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), it specifies that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in [this prohibition] may be construed to prohibit a State from using the procedures\xe2\x80\x9d described above\xe2\x80\x94sending a return card and removing registrants who fail to return the card and fail to vote for the requisite time.  Since one of the requirements for removal under subsection (d) is the failure to vote, the explanation added by HAVA makes clear that the Failure-to-Vote Clause\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on removal \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote\xe2\x80\x9d does not categorically preclude using nonvoting as part of a test for removal.  Another provision makes this point even more clearly by providing that \xe2\x80\x9cno registrant may be removed <i>solely</i> by reason of a failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents contend that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process for removing voters on change-of-residence grounds violates this federal law.  The Ohio process at issue relies on the failure to vote for two years as a rough way of identifying voters who may have moved.  It sends these nonvoters a preaddressed, postage prepaid return card, asking them to verify that they still reside at the same address.  Voters who do not return the card <i>and</i> fail to vote in any election for four more years are presumed to have moved and are removed from the rolls.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:The process that Ohio uses to remove voters on change-of-residence grounds does not violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause or any other part of the NVRA.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s law does not violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s removal process follows subsection (d) to the letter: It does not remove a registrant on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is sent and fails to mail back a return card and then fails to vote for an additional four years.  See \xc2\xa720507(d)(1)(B).  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, respondents argue that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process violates subsection (b)\xe2\x80\x99s Failure-to-Vote Clause by using a person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote twice over: once as the trigger for sending return cards and again as one of the two requirements for removal.  But Congress could not have meant for the Failure-to-Vote Clause to cannibalize subsection (d) in that way.  Instead, the Failure-to-Vote Clause, both as originally enacted in the NVRA and as amended by HAVA, simply forbids the use of nonvoting as <i>the sole criterion</i> for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d in the Failure-to-Vote Clause denotes some form of causation, see <i>Gross</i> v. <i>FBL Financial Services, Inc.</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, 176, and in context sole causation is the only type of causation that harmonizes the Failure-to-Vote Clause and subsection (d).  Any other reading would mean that a State that follows subsection (d) nevertheless can violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause.  When Congress enacted HAVA, it made this point explicit by adding to the Failure-to-Vote Clause an explanation of how the clause is to be read, <i>i.e.</i>, in a way that does not contradict subsection (d).  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s alternative reading is inconsistent with both the text of the Failure-to-Vote Clause and the clarification of its meaning in \xc2\xa721083(a)(4).  Among other things, their reading would make HAVA\xe2\x80\x99s new language worse than redundant, since no sensible person would read the Failure-to-Vote Clause as prohibiting what subsections (c) and (d) expressly allow.  Nor does the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation render the Failure-to-Vote Clause superfluous; the clause retains meaning because it prohibits States from using nonvoting both as the ground for removal and as the sole evidence for another ground for removal (<i>e.g.</i>, as the sole evidence that someone has died).  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(4)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 additional argument\xe2\x80\x94that so many registered voters discard return cards upon receipt that the failure to send cards back is worthless as evidence that an addressee has moved\xe2\x80\x94is based on a dubious empirical conclusion that conflicts with the congressional judgment found in subsection (d).  Congress clearly did not think that the failure to send back a return card was of no evidentiary value, having made that conduct one of the two requirements for removal under subsection (d).  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Nor has Ohio violated other NVRA provisions.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Ohio removes the registrants at issue on a permissible ground: change of residence.  The failure to return a notice and the failure to vote simply serve as <i>evidence</i> that a registrant has moved, not as the ground itself for removal.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The NVRA contains no \xe2\x80\x9creliable indicator\xe2\x80\x9d prerequisite to sending notices, requiring States to have good information that someone has moved before sending them a return card.  So long as the trigger for sending such notices is \xe2\x80\x9cuniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa720507(b)(1), States may use whatever trigger they think best, including the failure to vote.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0 Ohio has not violated the NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasonable effort\xe2\x80\x9d provision, \xc2\xa720507(a)(4).  Even assuming that this provision authorizes federal courts to go beyond the restrictions set out in subsections (b), (c), and (d) and strike down a state law that does not meet some standard of \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process cannot be unreasonable because it uses the change-of-residence evidence that Congress said it could: the failure to send back a notice coupled with the failure to vote for the requisite period.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process is accordingly lawful.

Pew Center on the States, Election Initiatives Issue Brief (Feb. 2012).  And about 2.75 million people are said to be registered to vote in more than one State.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>At issue in today\xe2\x80\x99s case is an Ohio law that aims to keep the State\xe2\x80\x99s voting lists up to date by removing the names of those who have moved out of the district where they are registered.  Ohio uses the failure to vote for two years as a rough way of identifying voters who may have moved, and it then sends a preaddressed, postage prepaid card to these individuals asking them to verify that they still reside at the same address.  Voters who do not return this card <i>and</i> fail to vote in any election for four more years are presumed to have moved and are removed from the rolls.  We are asked to decide whether this program complies with federal law.</p><p>I</p><p>A</p><p>Like other States, Ohio requires voters to reside in the district in which they vote.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73503.01(A) (West Supp. 2017); see National Conference of State Legislatures, Voting by Nonresidents and Non- citizens (Feb. 27, 2015).  When voters move out of that district, they become ineligible to vote there.  See \xc2\xa73503.01(A).  And since more than 10% of Americans move every year,[<a href="#F1">1</a>] deleting the names of those who have moved away is no small undertaking.</p><p>For many years, Congress left it up to the States to maintain accurate lists of those eligible to vote in federal elections, but in 1993, with the enactment of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), Congress intervened.  The NVRA \xe2\x80\x9cerect[s] a complex superstructure of federal regulation atop state voter-registration systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc.</i>,570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 5 (2013).  The Act has two main objectives: increasing voter registration and removing ineligible persons from the States\xe2\x80\x99 voter registration rolls.  See \xc2\xa72,107Stat.77,52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa720501(b).</p><p>To achieve the latter goal, the NVRA requires States to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names\xe2\x80\x9d of voters who are ineligible \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d death or change in residence.  \xc2\xa720507(a)(4).  The Act also prescribes requirements that a State must meet in order to remove a name on change-of-residence grounds.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(b), (c), (d).</p><p>The most important of these requirements is a prior notice obligation.  Before the NVRA, some States removed registrants without giving any notice.  See J. Harris, Nat. Munic. League, Model Voter Registration System 45 (rev. 4th ed. 1957).  The NVRA changed that by providing in \xc2\xa720507(d)(1) that a State may not remove a registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name on change-of-residence grounds unless either (A) the  registrant confirms in writing that he or she has moved or (B) the registrant fails to return a preaddressed, postage prepaid \xe2\x80\x9creturn card\xe2\x80\x9d containing statutorily prescribed content.  This card must explain what a registrant who has not moved needs to do in order to stay on the rolls, <i>i.e.</i>, either return the card or vote during the period covering the next two general federal elections.  \xc2\xa720507(d)(2)(A).  And for the benefit of those who have moved, the card must contain \xe2\x80\x9cinformation concerning how the registrant can continue to be eligible to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720507(d)(2)(B).  If the State does not send such a card or otherwise get written notice that the person has moved, it may not remove the registrant on change-of-residence grounds.  See \xc2\xa720507(d)(1).[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>While the NVRA is clear about the need to send a \xe2\x80\x9creturn card\xe2\x80\x9d (or obtain written confirmation of a move) before pruning a registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name, no provision of federal law specifies the circumstances under which a return card may be sent. Accordingly, States take a variety of approaches.  See Nat. Assn. of Secretaries of State (NASS) Report: Maintenance of State Voter Registration Lists 5\xe2\x80\x936 (Dec. 2017).  The NVRA itself sets out one option.  A State may send these cards to those who have submitted \xe2\x80\x9cchange-of-address information\xe2\x80\x9d to the United States Postal Service.  \xc2\xa720507(c)(1).  Thirty-six States do at least that.  See NASS Report, <i>supra</i>, at 5, and n.\xc2\xa0v (listing States).  Other States send notices to every registered voter at specified intervals (say, once a year).  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>Iowa Code \xc2\xa748A.28.3 (2012); S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93330(F), 7\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93340(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3) (2017 Cum. Supp.); see also S. Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x936, p.\xc2\xa046 (1993).  Still other States, including Ohio, take an intermediate approach, see NASS Report, <i>supra</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, such as sending notices to those who have turned in their driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, <i>e.g.</i>, Ind. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9338.2\xe2\x80\x932(b)(2), (c)(4) (2004),<i> </i>or sending notices to those who have not voted for some period of time, see, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> </i>Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa721\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93234 (Supp. 2017); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73503.21(B)(2); Okla. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7230:15\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x9319(a)(3) (2016); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 25, \xc2\xa71901(b)(3) (Purdon 2007); Wis. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa76.50(1) (2017 West Cum. Supp.).</p><p>When a State receives a return card confirming that a registrant has left the district, the State must remove the voter\xe2\x80\x99s name from the rolls.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(d)(1)(A), (3).  And if the State receives a card stating that the registrant has not moved, the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name must be kept on the list.  See \xc2\xa720507(d)(2)(A).</p><p>What if no return card is mailed back?  Congress obviously anticipated that some voters who received cards would fail to return them for any number of reasons, and it addressed this contingency in \xc2\xa720507(d), which, for convenience, we will simply call \xe2\x80\x9csubsection (d).\xe2\x80\x9d  Subsection (d) treats the failure to return a card as <i>some evidence</i>\xe2\x80\x94but by no means conclusive proof\xe2\x80\x94that the voter has moved.  Instead, the voter\xe2\x80\x99s name is kept on the list for a period covering two general elections for federal office (usually about four years).  Only if the registrant fails to vote during that period and does not otherwise confirm that he or she still lives in the district (<i>e.g.</i>, by updating address information online) may the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name be removed.  \xc2\xa720507(d)(2)(A); see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(d)(1)(B), (3).</p><p>In addition to these specific change-of-residence requirements, the NVRA also imposes two general limitations that are applicable to state removal programs.  First, all such programs must be \xe2\x80\x9cuniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720507(b)(1).  Second, the NVRA contains what we will call the \xe2\x80\x9cFailure-to-Vote Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa720507(b)(2).</p><p>At present, this clause contains two parts.  The first is a prohibition that was included in the NVRA when it was originally enacted in 1993.  It provides that a state program \xe2\x80\x9cshall not result in the removal of the name of any person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The second part, added by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA),116Stat.1666, explains the meaning of that prohibition.  This explanation says that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in [the prohibition] may be construed to prohibit a State from using the procedures described in [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507](c) and (d) to remove an individual from the official list of eligible voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720507(b)(2).</p><p>These referenced subsections, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(c) and (d), are the provisions allowing the removal of registrants who either submitted change-of-address information to the Postal Service (subsection (c)) or did not mail back a return card and did not vote during a period covering two general federal elections (subsection (d)).  And since one of the requirements for removal under subsection (d) is the failure to vote during this period, the explanation added by HAVA in 2002 makes it clear that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote\xe2\x80\x9d in the Failure-to-Vote Clause does not categorically preclude the use of nonvoting as part of a test for removal.</p><p>Another provision of HAVA makes this point more directly.  After directing that \xe2\x80\x9cregistrants who have not responded to a notice and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have not voted in 2 consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed,\xe2\x80\x9d it adds that \xe2\x80\x9cno registrant may be removed <i>solely</i> by reason of a failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A)<i> </i>(emphasis added).</p><p>B</p><p>Since 1994, Ohio has used two procedures to identify and remove voters who have lost their residency qualification.</p><p>First, the State utilizes the Postal Service option set out in the NVRA.  The State sends notices to registrants whom the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnational change of address service\xe2\x80\x9d identifies as having moved.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73503.21(B)(1).  This procedure is undisputedly lawful.  See52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa720507(c)(1).</p><p>But because according to the Postal Service \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s many as 40 percent of people who move do not inform the Postal Service,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3">3</a>] Ohio does not rely on this information alone.  In its so-called Supplemental Process, Ohio \xe2\x80\x9cidentif[ies] electors whose lack of voter activity indicates they may have moved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 401 (emphasis deleted).  Under this process, Ohio sends notices to registrants who have \xe2\x80\x9cnot engage[d] in any voter activity for a period of two consecutive years.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1509.  \xe2\x80\x9cVoter activity\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9ccasting a ballot\xe2\x80\x9d in any election\xe2\x80\x94whether general, primary, or special and whether federal, state, or local.  See <i>id.</i>, at 1507.  (And Ohio regularly holds elections on both even and odd years.)  Moreover, the term \xe2\x80\x9cvoter activity\xe2\x80\x9d is broader than simply voting.  It also includes such things as \xe2\x80\x9csign[ing] a petition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfiling a voter registration form, and updating a voting address with a variety of [state] entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 295, 357.</p><p>After sending these notices, Ohio removes registrants from the rolls only if they \xe2\x80\x9cfai[l] to respond\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontinu[e] to be inactive for an additional period of four consecutive years, including two federal general elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1509; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa73503.21(B)(2).  Federal law specifies that a registration may be canceled if the registrant does not vote \xe2\x80\x9cin an election during the period\xe2\x80\x9d covering two general federal elections after notice, \xc2\xa720507(d)(1)(B)(ii), but Ohio rounds up to \xe2\x80\x9cfour consecutive years\xe2\x80\x9d of nonvoting after notice, Record 1509.  Thus, a person remains on the rolls if he or she votes in any election during that period\xe2\x80\x94which in Ohio typically means voting in any of the at least four elections after notice.  Combined with the two years of nonvoting before notice is sent, that makes a total of six years of nonvoting before removal.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>C</p><p>A pair of advocacy groups and an Ohio resident (respondents here) think that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process violates the NVRA and HAVA.  They sued petitioner, Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of State, seeking to enjoin this process.  Respondents alleged, first, that Ohio removes voters who have not actually moved, thus purging the rolls of <i>eligible </i>voters.  They also contended that Ohio violates the NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s Failure-to-Vote Clause because the failure to vote plays a prominent part in the Ohio removal scheme: Failure to vote for two years triggers the sending of a return card, and if the card is not returned, failure to vote for four more years results in removal.</p><p>The District Court rejected both of these arguments and entered judgment for the Secretary.  It held that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process \xe2\x80\x9cmirror[s] the procedures established by the NVRA\xe2\x80\x9d for removing people on change-of-residence grounds and does not violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause because it does not remove anyone \xe2\x80\x9c<i>solely </i>for [their] failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a, 57a, 69a\xe2\x80\x9370a.</p><p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  838 F.\xc2\xa03d 699 (2016).  It focused on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 second argument, holding that Ohio violates the Failure-to-Vote Clause because it sends change-of-residence notices \xe2\x80\x9cbased \xe2\x80\x98solely\xe2\x80\x99 on a person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 711.  In dissent, Judge Siler explained why he saw the case as a simple one: \xe2\x80\x9cThe State cannot remove the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name from the rolls for a failure to vote only, and Ohio does not do [that].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 716.</p><p>We granted certiorari, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), and now reverse.</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>As noted, subsection (d), the provision of the NVRA that directly addresses the procedures that a State must follow before removing a registrant from the rolls on change-of-residence grounds, provides that a State may remove a registrant who \xe2\x80\x9c(i) has failed to respond to a notice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c(ii) has not voted or appeared to vote .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. during the pe- riod beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after the date of the second general election for Fed- eral office that occurs after the date of the notice\xe2\x80\x9d (about four years).52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa720507(d)(1)(B).  Not only are States allowed to remove registrants who satisfy these requirements, but federal law makes this removal mandatory.  \xc2\xa720507(d)(3); see also \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A).</p><p>Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process follows subsection (d) to the letter.  It is undisputed that Ohio does not remove a registrant on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is sent and fails to mail back a return card and then fails to vote for an additional four years.</p><p>B</p><p>Respondents argue (and the Sixth Circuit held) that, even if Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process complies with subsection (d), it nevertheless violates the Failure-to-Vote Clause\xe2\x80\x94the clause that generally prohibits States from removing people from the rolls \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of [a] person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa720507(b)(2); see also \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A).  Respondents point out that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process uses a person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote twice: once as the trigger for sending return cards and again as one of the requirements for removal.  Respondents conclude that this use of nonvoting is illegal.</p><p>We reject this argument because the Failure-to-Vote Clause, both as originally enacted in the NVRA and as amended by HAVA, simply forbids the use of nonvoting as <i>the sole criterion</i> for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way.  Instead, as permitted by subsection (d), Ohio removes registrants only if they have failed to vote <i>and</i> have failed to respond to a notice.</p><p>When Congress clarified the meaning of the NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s Failure-to-Vote Clause in HAVA, here is what it said: \xe2\x80\x9c[C]onsistent with the [NVRA], .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no registrant may be removed <i>solely</i> by reason of a failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  The meaning of these words is straightforward.  \xe2\x80\x9cSolely\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9calone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2168 (2002); American Heritage Dictionary 1654 (4th ed. 2000).  And \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cquite formal\xe2\x80\x9d way of saying \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause of.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Ammer, American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms 67 (2d ed. 2013).  Thus, a State violates the Failure-to-Vote Clause only if it removes registrants for no reason other than their failure to vote.</p><p>This explanation of the meaning of the Failure-to-Vote Clause merely makes explicit what was implicit in the clause as originally enacted.  At that time, the clause simply said that a state program \xe2\x80\x9cshall not result in the removal of the name of any person from the [rolls for federal elections] by reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d107Stat.83.  But that prohibition had to be read together with subsection (d), which authorized removal if a registrant did not send back a return card and also failed to vote during a period covering two successive general elections for federal office.  If possible, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e must interpret the statute to give effect to both provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ricci</i> v. <i>DeStefano</i>,557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 580 (2009), and here, that is quite easy.</p><p>The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d denotes some form of causation.  See <i>Gross</i> v. <i>FBL Financial Services, Inc.</i>,557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, 176 (2009).  Thus, the Failure-to-Vote Clause applies when nonvoting, in some sense, causes a registrant\xe2\x80\x99s name to be removed, but the law recognizes several types of causation.  When a statutory provision includes an undefined causation requirement, we look to context to decide whether the statute demands only but-for cause as opposed to proximate cause or sole cause.  See <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</i>,503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258, 265\xe2\x80\x93268 (1992).  Cf. <i>CSX Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>McBride</i>,564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 685, 692\xe2\x80\x93693 (2011).</p><p>Which form of causation is required by the Failure-to-Vote Clause?  We can readily rule out but-for causation.  If \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d in the Failure-to-Vote Clause meant but-for causation, a State would violate the clause if the failure to vote played a necessary part in the removal of a name from the list.  <i>Burrage</i> v. <i>United States</i>,571 U.\xc2\xa0S. 204, 211 (2014).  But the removal process expressly authorized by subsection (d) allows a State to remove a registrant if the registrant, in addition to failing to send back a return card, fails to vote during a period covering two general federal elections.  So if the Failure-to-Vote Clause were read in this way, it would cannibalize subsection (d).</p><p>Interpreting the Failure-to-Vote Clause as incorporating a proximate cause requirement would lead to a similar problem.  Proximate cause is an elusive concept, see <i>McBride</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 692\xe2\x80\x93693, but no matter how the term is understood, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the failure to vote is a proximate cause of removal under subsection (d).  If a registrant, having failed to send back a return card, also fails to vote during the period covering the next two general federal elections, removal is the direct, foreseeable, and closely connected consequence.  See <i>Paroline</i> v. <i>United States</i>,572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 434, 444\xe2\x80\x93445 (2014); <i>Bridge</i> v. <i>Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.</i>,553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639, 654 (2008).</p><p>By process of elimination, we are left with sole causation.  This reading harmonizes the Failure-to-Vote Clause and subsection (d) because the latter provision does not authorize removal solely by reason of a person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.  Instead, subsection (d) authorizes removal only if a registrant also fails to mail back a return card.</p><p>For these reasons, we conclude that the Failure-to-Vote Clause, as originally enacted, referred to sole causation.  And when Congress enacted HAVA, it made this point explicit.  It added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause itself an explanation of how it is to be read, <i>i.e.</i>, in a way that does not contradict subsection (d).  And in language that cannot be misunderstood, it reiterated what the clause means: \xe2\x80\x9c[R]egistrants who have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in 2 consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed from the official list of eligible voters, except that no registrant may be removed <i>solely</i> by reason of a failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  In this way, HAVA dispelled any doubt that a state removal program may use the failure to vote as a factor (but not the sole factor) in removing names from the list of registered voters.</p><p>That is exactly what Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process does.  It does not strike any registrant solely by reason of the failure to vote.  Instead, as expressly permitted by federal law, it removes registrants only when they have failed to vote <i>and</i> have failed to respond to a change-of-residence notice.</p><p>C</p><p>Respondents and the dissent advance an alternative interpretation of the Failure-to-Vote Clause, but that reading is inconsistent with both the text of the clause and the clarification of its meaning in \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A).  Respondents argue that the clause allows States to consider nonvoting only to the extent that subsection (d) requires\xe2\x80\x94that is, only <i>after</i> a registrant has failed to mail back a notice.  Any other use of the failure to vote, including as the trigger for mailing a notice, they claim, is proscribed.  In essence, respondents read the language added to the clause by HAVA\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that nothing in this paragraph may be construed to prohibit a State from using the procedures described in subsections (c) and (d)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as an exception to the general rule forbidding the use of nonvoting.  See Brief for Respondents 37.  And the Sixth Circuit seemed to find this point dispositive, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exceptions in statutes must be strictly construed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  838 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 708 (quoting <i>Detroit Edison Co.</i> v. <i>SEC</i>, 119 F.\xc2\xa02d 730, 739 (CA6 1941)).</p><p>We reject this argument for three reasons.  First, it distorts what the new language added by HAVA actually says.  The new language does not create an exception to a general rule against the use of nonvoting.  It does not say that the failure to vote may not be used \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that this paragraph does not prohibit a State from using the procedures described in subsections (c) and (d).\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, it says that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in this paragraph <i>may be construed</i>\xe2\x80\x9d to have that effect.  \xc2\xa720507(b)(2) (emphasis added).  Thus, it sets out not an exception, but a rule of interpretation.  It does not narrow the language that precedes it; it clarifies what that language means.  That is precisely what Congress said when it enacted HAVA: It added the \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be construed\xe2\x80\x9d provision to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]larif[y],\xe2\x80\x9d not to alter, the prohibition\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  \xc2\xa7903,116Stat.1728.</p><p>Second, under respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading, HAVA\xe2\x80\x99s new language is worse than superfluous.  Even without the added language, no sensible person would read the Failure-to-Vote Clause as prohibiting what subsections (c) and (d) expressly allow.  Yet according to respondents, that is all that the new language accomplishes.  So at a minimum, it would be redundant.</p><p>But the implications of this reading are actually worse than that.  There is no reason to create an exception to a prohibition unless the prohibition would otherwise forbid what the exception allows.  So if the new language were an exception, it would seem to follow that prior to HAVA, the Failure-to-Vote Clause <i>did</i> outlaw what subsections (c) and (d) specifically authorize.  And that, of course, would be nonsensical.</p><p>Third, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the language that HAVA added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause makes it hard to understand why Congress prescribed in another section of the same Act, <i>i.e.</i>, \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A), that \xe2\x80\x9cno registrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  As interpreted by respondents, the amended Failure-to-Vote Clause prohibits any use of nonvoting with just two narrow exceptions\xe2\x80\x94the uses allowed by subsections (c) and (d).  So, according to respondents, the amended Failure-to-Vote Clause prohibits much more than \xc2\xa721083(a)(4)(A).  That provision, in addition to allowing the use of nonvoting in accordance with subsections (c) and (d), also permits the use of nonvoting in any other way that does not treat nonvoting as the sole basis for removal.</p><p>There is no plausible reason why Congress would enact the provision that respondents envision.  As interpreted by respondents, HAVA would be like a law that contains one provision making it illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or higher and another provision making it illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 or higher.  The second provision would not only be redundant; it would be confusing and downright silly.</p><p>Our reading, on the other hand, gives the new language added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause \xe2\x80\x9creal and substantial effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Husky Int\xe2\x80\x99l Electronics, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ritz</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It clarifies the meaning of the prohibition against removal by reason of nonvoting, a matter that troubled some States prior to HAVA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, FEC Report on the NVRA to the 106th Congress 19 (1999).</p><p>Respondents and the dissent separately claim that the Failure-to-Vote Clause must be read to bar the use of nonvoting as a trigger for sending return cards because otherwise it would be \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 17 (opinion of Breyer, J.); see Brief for Respondents 29.  After all, subsection (d) already prohibits States from removing registrants because of a failure to vote alone.  See \xc2\xa720507(d)(1).  To have meaning independent of subsection (d), respondents reason, the Failure-to-Vote Clause must prohibit other uses of the failure to vote, including its use as a trigger for sending out notices.</p><p>This argument is flawed because the Failure-to-Vote Clause has plenty of work to do under our reading.  Most important, it prohibits the once-common state practice of removing registered voters simply because they failed to vote for some period of time.  Not too long ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ancellation for failure to vote [was] the principal means used .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to purge the [voter] lists.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harris, Model Voter Registration System, at 44.  States did not use a person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote as evidence that the person had died or moved but as an independent ground for removal.  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  Ohio was one such State.  Its Constitution provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny elector who fails to vote in at least one election during any period of four consecutive years shall cease to be an elector unless he again registers to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. V, \xc2\xa71 (1977).</p><p>In addition, our reading prohibits States from using the failure to vote as the sole cause for removal on <i>any</i> ground, not just because of a change of residence.  Recall that subsection (d)\xe2\x80\x99s removal process applies only to change-of-residence removals but that the Failure-to-Vote Clause applies to <i>all</i> removals.  Without the Failure-to-Vote Clause, therefore, States could use the failure to vote as conclusive evidence of ineligibility for some reason other than change of residence, such as death, mental incapac- ity, or a criminal conviction resulting in prolonged imprisonment.</p><p>D</p><p>Respondents put forth one additional argument regarding the Failure-to-Vote Clause.  In essence, it boils down to this.  So many properly registered voters simply discard return cards upon receipt that the failure to send them back is worthless as evidence that the addressee has moved.  As respondents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel put it at argument, \xe2\x80\x9ca notice that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get returned\xe2\x80\x9d tells the State \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely nothing about whether the person has moved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 58.  According to respondents, when Ohio removes registrants for failing to respond to a notice and failing to vote, it functionally \xe2\x80\x9cremoves people solely for non-voting\xe2\x80\x9d unless the State has additional \xe2\x80\x9creliable evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that a registrant has moved.  <i>Id</i>., at 49, 71.</p><p>This argument is based on a dubious empirical conclusion that the NVRA and HAVA do not allow us to indulge.  Congress clearly did not think that the failure to send back a return card was of no evidentiary value because Congress made that conduct one of the two requirements for removal under subsection (d).</p><p>Requiring additional evidence not only second-guesses the congressional judgment embodied in subsection (d)\xe2\x80\x99s removal process, but it also second-guesses<i> </i>the judgment of the Ohio Legislature as expressed in the State\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process.  The Constitution gives States the authority to set the qualifications for voting in congressional elections, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01; Amdt. 17, as well as the authority to set the \xe2\x80\x9cTimes, Places and Manner\xe2\x80\x9d to conduct such elections in the absence of contrary congressional direction, Art. I, \xc2\xa74, cl.\xc2\xa01.  We have no authority to dismiss the considered judgment of Congress and the Ohio Legislature regarding the probative value of a registrant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to send back a return card.  See <i>Inter Tribal</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9319; see also <i>id.</i>, at 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (Thomas, J., dissenting); <i>id.</i>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343, 46 (Alito, J., dissenting).</p><p>For all these reasons, we hold that Ohio law does not violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause.</p><p>III</p><p>We similarly reject respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that Ohio violates other provisions of the NVRA and HAVA.</p><p>A</p><p>Respondents contend that Ohio removes registered voters on a ground not permitted by the NVRA.  They claim that the NVRA permits the removal of a name for only a few specified reasons\xe2\x80\x94a person\xe2\x80\x99s request, criminal conviction, mental incapacity, death, change of residence, and initial ineligibility.  Brief for Respondents 25\xe2\x80\x9326; see 52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(a)(3), (4).[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  And they argue that Ohio removes registrants for other reasons, namely, for failing to respond to a notice and failing to vote.</p><p>This argument plainly fails.  Ohio simply treats the failure to return a notice and the failure to vote as evidence that a registrant has moved, not as a ground for removal.  And in doing this, Ohio simply follows federal law.  Subsection (d), which governs removals \xe2\x80\x9con the ground that the registrant has changed residence,\xe2\x80\x9d treats the failure to return a notice and the failure to vote as evidence that this ground is satisfied.  \xc2\xa720507(d)(1).</p><p>If respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument were correct, then it would also be illegal to remove a name under \xc2\xa720507(c) because that would constitute removal for submitting change-of-address information to the Postal Service.  Likewise, if a State removed a name after receiving a death certificate or a judgment of criminal conviction, that would be illegal because receipt of such documents is not listed as a permitted ground for removal under \xc2\xa720507(a)(3) or \xc2\xa720507(a)(4).  About this argument no more need be said.</p><p>B</p><p>Respondents maintain, finally, that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s procedure is illegal because the State sends out notices without having any \xe2\x80\x9creliable indicator\xe2\x80\x9d that the addressee has moved.  Brief for Respondents 31.  The \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ailure to vote for a mere two-year period,\xe2\x80\x9d they argue, does not reliably \xe2\x80\x9cindicate that a registrant has moved out of the jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 30; see also, <i>e.g.</i>, Brief for State of New York et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>13\xe2\x80\x9328.</p><p>This argument also fails.  The degree of correlation between the failure to vote for two years and a change of residence is debatable, but we know from subsection (d) that Congress thought that the failure to vote for a period of two consecutive general elections was a good indicator of change of residence, since it made nonvoting for that period an element of subsection (d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for removal.  In a similar vein, the Ohio Legislature appar- ently thought that nonvoting for two years was sufficiently correlated with a change of residence to justify sending a return card.</p><p>What matters for present purposes is not whether the Ohio Legislature overestimated the correlation between nonvoting and moving or whether it reached a wise policy judgment about when return cards should be sent.  For us, all that matters is that no provision of the NVRA prohibits the legislature from implementing that judgment.  Neither subsection (d) nor any other provision of the NVRA demands that a State have some particular quantum of evidence of a change of residence before sending a registrant a return card.  So long as the trigger for sending such notices is \xe2\x80\x9cuniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa720507(b)(1), States can use whatever plan they think best.  That may be why not even the Sixth Circuit relied on this rationale.</p><p>Respondents attempt to find support for their argument in subsection (c), which allows States to send notices based on Postal Service change-of-address information.  This provision, they argue, implicitly sets a minimum reliability requirement.  Thus, they claim, a State may not send out a return card unless its evidence of change of residence is at least as probative as the information obtained from the Postal Service.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56.</p><p>Nothing in subsection (c) suggests that it is designed to play this role.  Subsection (c) says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] State may meet\xe2\x80\x9d its obligation \xe2\x80\x9cto remove the names\xe2\x80\x9d of ineligible voters on change-of-residence grounds by sending notices to voters who are shown by the Postal Service information to have moved, but subsection (c) does not even hint that it imposes any sort of minimum reliability requirement for sending such notices.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720507(a)(4), (c).  By its terms, subsection (c) simply provides one way\xe2\x80\x94the minimal way\xe2\x80\x94in which a State \xe2\x80\x9c<i>may</i> meet the [NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s] requirement[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for change-of-residence removals.  \xc2\xa720507(c) (emphasis added).  As respondents agreed at argument, it is not the only way.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 53.</p><p>C</p><p>Nothing in the two dissents changes our analysis of the statutory language.</p><p>1</p><p>Despite its length and complexity, the principal dissent sets out only two arguments.  See <i>post</i>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The first is one that we have already discussed at length, namely, that the Failure-to-Vote Clause prohibits any use of the failure to vote except as permitted by subsections (c) and (d).  We have explained why this argument is insupportable, <i>supra</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316, and the dissent has no answer to any of the problems we identify.</p><p>The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s only other argument is that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s process violates \xc2\xa720507(a)(4), which requires States to make a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable effort\xe2\x80\x9d to remove the names of ineligible voters from the rolls.  The dissent thinks that this provision authorizes the federal courts to go beyond the restrictions set out in subsections (b), (c), and (d) and to strike down any state law that does not meet their own standard of \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  But see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>28\xe2\x80\x9329.  The dissent contends that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s system violates this supposed \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d requirement primarily because it relies on the failure to mail back the postcard sent to those who have not engaged in voter activity for two years.  Based on its own cobbled-together statistics, <i>post</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, and a feature of human nature of which the dissent has apparently taken judicial notice (<i>i.e.</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe human tendency not to send back cards received in the mail,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 13), the dissent argues that the failure to send back the card in question \xe2\x80\x9chas no tendency to reveal accurately whether the registered voter has changed residences\xe2\x80\x9d; it is an \xe2\x80\x9cirrelevant factor\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cshows nothing at all that is statutorily significant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, 17.</p><p>Whatever the meaning of \xc2\xa720507(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to reasonableness, the principal dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails since it is the federal NVRA, not Ohio law, that attaches importance to the failure to send back the card.

Congress enacted the NVRA against the backdrop of substantial efforts by States to disenfranchise low-income and minority voters, including programs that purged eligible voters from registration lists because they failed to vote in prior elections.  The Court errs in ignoring this history and distorting the statutory text to arrive at a conclusion that not only is contrary to the plain language of the NVRA but also contradicts the essential purposes of the statute, ultimately sanctioning the very purging that Congress expressly sought to protect against.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Concerted state efforts to prevent minorities from voting and to undermine the efficacy of their votes are an unfortunate feature of our country\xe2\x80\x99s history.  See <i>Schuette</i> v. <i>BAMN</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 291, 337\xe2\x80\x93338 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  As the principal dissent explains, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of \xe2\x80\x98[r]estrictive registration laws and administrative procedures\xe2\x80\x99 came to use across the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  States enforced \xe2\x80\x9cpoll tax[es], literacy tests, residency requirements, selective purges, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and annual registration requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d which were developed \xe2\x80\x9cto keep certain groups of citizens from voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x939, p. 2 (1993).  Particularly relevant here, some States erected procedures requiring voters to renew registrations \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever [they] moved or failed to vote in an election,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9csharply depressed turnout, particularly among blacks and immigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Keyssar, The Right To Vote 124 (2009).  Even after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, many obstacles remained.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2 (opinion of Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress was well aware of the \xe2\x80\x9clong history of such list cleaning mechanisms which have been used to violate the basic rights of citizens\xe2\x80\x9d when it enacted the NVRA.  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x936, p. 18 (1993).  Congress thus made clear in the statutory findings that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n52 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa720501(a).  In light of those findings, Congress enacted the NVRA with the express purposes of \xe2\x80\x9cincreas[ing] the number of eligible citizens who register to vote\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cenhanc[ing] the participation of eligible citizens as voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720501(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  These stated purposes serve at least in part to counteract the history of voter suppression, as evidenced by \xc2\xa720507(b)(2), which forbids \xe2\x80\x9cthe removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, Congress also expressed other objectives, \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the integrity of the electoral process\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa720501(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x93(4).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The statute contemplates, however, that States can, and indeed must, further all four stated objectives.  As relevant here, Congress crafted the NVRA with the understanding that, while States are required to make a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable effort\xe2\x80\x9d to remove ineligible voters from the registration lists, \xc2\xa720507(a)(4), such removal programs must be developed in a manner that \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[s] poor and illiterate voters from being caught in a purge system which will require them to needlessly re-register\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[s] abuse which has a disparate impact on minority communities,\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x936, at 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Process reflects precisely the type of purge system that the NVRA was designed to prevent.  Under the Supplemental Process, Ohio will purge a registrant from the rolls after six years of not voting, <i>e.g., </i>sitting out one Presidential election and two midterm elections, and after failing to send back one piece of mail, even though there is no reasonable basis to believe the individual actually moved.  See <i>ante,</i> at 14 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  This purge program burdens the rights of eligible voters.  At best, purged voters are forced to \xe2\x80\x9cneedlessly reregister\xe2\x80\x9d if they decide to vote in a subsequent election; at worst, they are prevented from voting at all because they never receive information about when and where elections are taking place.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is unsurprising in light of the history of such purge programs that numerous <i>amici</i> report that the Supplemental Process has disproportionately affected minority, low-income, disabled, and veteran voters.  As one example, <i>amici</i> point to an investigation that revealed that in Hamilton County, \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican-American-majority neighborhoods in downtown Cincinnati had 10% of their voters removed due to inactivity\xe2\x80\x9d since 2012, as \xe2\x80\x9ccompared to only 4% of voters in a suburban, majority-white neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  <i>Amici</i> also explain at length how low voter turnout rates, language-access problems, mail delivery issues, inflexible work schedules, and transportation issues, among other obstacles, make it more difficult for many minority, low-income, disabled, homeless, and veteran voters to cast a ballot or return a notice, rendering them particularly vulnerable to unwarranted removal under the Supplemental Process.  See Brief for Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 15\xe2\x80\x9326; Brief for National Disability Rights Network et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>17, 21\xe2\x80\x9324, 29\xe2\x80\x9331; Brief for VoteVets Action Fund as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 23\xe2\x80\x9330.  See also Brief for Libertarian National Committee as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19\xe2\x80\x9322 (burdens on principled nonvoters).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither the majority nor Ohio meaningfully dispute that the Supplemental Process disproportionately burdens these communities.  At oral argument, Ohio suggested that such a disparate impact is not pertinent to this case because respondents did not challenge the Supplemental Process under \xc2\xa720507(b)(1), which requires that any removal program \xe2\x80\x9cbe uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.  The fact that respondents did not raise a claim under \xc2\xa720507(b)(1), however, is wholly irrelevant to our assessment of whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Supplemental Process removes voters \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the person\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of \xc2\xa720507(b)(2).  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, <i>ante,</i> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, the NVRA\xe2\x80\x99s express findings and purpose are highly relevant to that interpretive analysis because they represent \xe2\x80\x9cthe assumed facts and the purposes that the majority of the enacting legislature .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. had in mind, and these can shed light on the meaning of the operative provisions that follow.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 218 (2012).  Respondents need not demonstrate discriminatory intent to establish that Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the NVRA is contrary to the statutory text and purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In concluding that the Supplemental Process does not violate the NVRA, the majority does more than just misconstrue the statutory text.  It entirely ignores the history of voter suppression against which the NVRA was enacted and upholds a program that appears to further the very disenfranchisement of minority and low-income voters that Congress set out to eradicate.  States, though, need not choose to be so unwise.  Our democracy rests on the ability of all individuals, regardless of race, income, or status, to exercise their right to vote.  The majority of States have found ways to maintain accurate voter rolls without initiating removal processes based solely on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s failure to vote.
