The common boundary between the States of Arkansas and Mississippi in the Mississippi River is the thalweg, which is the middle of the main navigable channel followed as the principal course of downstream navigation.  This judgment determines the geographical location of this boundary in the reach of the Mississippi River, as more particularly described hereinafter, separating portions of Lee County, Arkansas and Tunica County, Mississippi in the vicinity of Bordeaux Point and Whiskey Island/Bordeaux Island.</p>\n<p>2. Establishment of the common Arkansas-Mississippi boundary in "old" Walnut Bend, looping Whiskey Island/ Bordeaux Island, originated with the Bordeaux Chute Cutoff, which occurred in or about 1874 and was complete in or about 1883.  The locus of that portion of the state boundary consisting of approximately the eastern one-half of "old" Walnut Bend has been subsequently established by long acquiescence by the States of Arkansas and Mississippi in private boundary lines resulting from prior litigation and agreements among the owners of lands adjacent thereto.  The locus of these private boundaries, which the States of Arkansas and Mississippi have adopted by acquiescence as also being the locus of the interstate boundary, is as shown on the map of Mr. W. H. Guyer, a true and correct copy of which is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 471 U. S. 378</a></p><p> attached hereto as Exhibit "A" <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/377/case.html">*</a></span> and described by geodetic coordinates as Segment B, Points PA through PL, in the composite description set forth hereinafter.  The remainder of the interstate boundary in approximately the western one-half of "old" Walnut Bend lies along the dead thalweg of the Mississippi River as it existed when the River\'s flow ceased in this abandoned bendway subsequent to, and caused by, the Bordeaux Chute Cutoff.  The locus of this portion of the interstate boundary in "old" Walnut Bend is as shown in Exhibit "B" and described as Segment B, Points Pm through Pbb in the composite description set forth hereinafter.</p>\n<p>3. Establishment of the common Arkansas-Mississippi boundary along the southerly limit of Bordeaux Point originated with the Hardin Point Cutoff, constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1942.  In 1947, when the Mississippi River ceased to flow in this abandoned bendway (Fox Island Bend), the locus of the state boundary along the dead thalweg was determined by Mr. St. George Richardson, whose plat thereof has been accepted since that time by the States of Arkansas and Mississippi as correctly depicting this portion of the interstate boundary looping Bordeaux Point.  A true and correct copy of the St. George Richardson survey is attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and described as Segment D in the composite description set forth hereinafter.</p>\n<p>The common Arkansas-Mississippi boundary looping Bordeaux Point between Lee County, Arkansas and Tunica County, Mississippi, from the upper end of Mhoon Bend to the upper end of Fox Island Bend, exclusive of that portion of this boundary in "old" Walnut Bend looping Whiskey Island/Bordeaux Island, is depicted on Exhibit "D" and described </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 471 U. S. 379</a></p><p> as Segment A and Segments C and D in the composite description set forth hereinafter.</p>\n<p>4.
