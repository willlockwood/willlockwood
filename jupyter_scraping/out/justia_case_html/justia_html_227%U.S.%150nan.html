S. 155</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This was a criminal prosecution in the State of Oregon, instituted by an information charging the defendants, of whom the plaintiff in error was one, with having converted to their own use a large sum of money belonging to the state\'s irreducible school fund, agricultural college fund, and university fund, collectively spoken of as educational funds, then held for safekeeping in a bank of which the defendants were in control as its officers and directors.  Upon a separate trial of the plaintiff in error, he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment and to pay a fine.  An appeal to the supreme court of the state resulted in the elimination of the fine and in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 227 U. S. 156</a></p><p> affirmance of the judgment in other respects. 55 Or. 450 -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 104 P. 596, 106 P. 1022. The plaintiff in error then brought the case here, claiming that rights secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, and specially set up in the supreme court of the state, were denied by the judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p>Briefly outlined, the case, as we must take it to be, is as follows:  in June, 1907, the bank became an "active depository" under a statute of the state presently to be mentioned, and thereupon an account was opened with the bank as such depository in the name of the state treasurer, with the added designation, "educational."  The deposits going into the account consisted of checks and drafts belonging to the state\'s educational funds, and the money collected by the bank on these checks and drafts, less what was drawn out by the state, amounted on November 6, 1907, to $288,426.87.  On that day, the bank failed, and it was then disclosed that, on August 21, the total cash in the bank was $296.19 short of the amount called for by the account, and that this shortage had continued and increased until the day of the failure, when it reached $274,882.73.  The defendants had not literally appropriated any of the money to their personal use, but, knowing that it belonged to the state\'s educational funds, and was received and held by the bank as an active depository, had permitted it to be commingled with other deposits and funds, and had sanctioned its use in paying liabilities of the bank.</p>\n<p>The prosecution was founded upon \xc2\xa7 1807 of Bellinger &amp; Cotton\'s Anno.Codes &amp; Statutes of Oregon, which declares:</p>\n<p>"If any person shall receive any money whatever for this state, . . . or shall have in his possession any money whatever belonging to such state, . . . and shall in any way convert to his own use any portion thereof, . . . such person shall be deemed guilty of larceny. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 227 U. S. 157</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By an act taking effect May 26, 1907, Laws of 1907, c. 135, p. 248, the legislature of the state provided for the designation of "state depositories for the purpose of receiving on deposit funds of this state, and paying out the same on order or checks of the state treasurer" (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 2); made it the duty of the treasurer to "deposit and at all times keep on deposit" in such depositories the "money in his hands belonging to the several funds in the state treasury," excepting a reserve of not to exceed $100,000 with which to pay current obligations (\xc2\xa7 3); required each depository to pay interest on deposits of such funds at not less than two percent per annum (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3, 4), and to give approved security "for the payment of such deposits and the interest thereon" (\xc2\xa7 5), and made the following declaration relating to educational funds (\xc2\xa716):</p>\n<p>"The word \'funds,\' used in this act, shall apply to all funds in the state treasury except the common school, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/us/227/150/case.html">*</a></span> agricultural college, and university funds."</p>\n<p>The same act authorized the designation of</p>\n<p>"an active depository for the collection of any drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, and coupons that may be received by him [the treasurer] on account of any claim due the state"</p>\n<p>(\xc2\xa7 6); required such depository to give approved security</p>\n<p>"for the prompt collection of all drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, or coupons that may be delivered to such active depository by the state treasurer for collection; also, for the safekeeping and prompt payment on the state treasurers\' order of the proceeds of all such collections"</p>\n<p>(\xc2\xa7 7), and in that connection provided (\xc2\xa7 8):</p>\n<p>"The state treasurer, on receipt of any draft, check, or certificate of deposit, on account of state dues, may place the same in such active depository for collection, and it shall be the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 227 U. S. 158</a></p><p> duty of such active depository to collect the same without delay, without charge for its services for such collection, or for exchange, and to notify the state treasurer when collected.  The compensation to be paid by such active, depository shall be fixed by the state treasurer upon the best terms obtainable for the state."</p>\n<p>The words "funds" particularly defined in \xc2\xa7 16, as before quoted, was not used in any of the sections having special relation to the active depository.</p>\n<p>Before the passage of the depository act, the supreme court of the state had occasion to consider and determine, in <em>Baker v. Williams Banking Co.,</em> 42 Or. 213, 222-225, whether, in view of \xc2\xa7 1807 of Bellinger &amp; Cotton\'s Codes (then \xc2\xa7 1772, Hill\'s Ann.Laws), the state treasurer lawfully could make a general deposit in a bank of money of the state belonging to its educational funds, and it was held that he could, the court saying:</p>\n<p>"It is made a felony by statute for any person having in his possession any money belonging to the state, county, town, or other municipality to convert to his own use or loan the same, with or without interest (Hill\'s Ann.Laws, \xc2\xa7 1772), and while a mere deposit in a bank for safekeeping is not inhibited by this provision, it is manifest that, in case of the failure of the bank, the officer is not entitled to interest in his own right on the fund so deposited, whatever the right of the state or municipality might be in the premises.  If, therefore, the claims are in fact for public money, as the objectors allege, no interest should be allowed thereon.  A public officer may not loan, with or without interest, any part of the public funds in his possession without being guilty of a felony, but he is required to keep such funds safely, and for that purpose may deposit them in a bank, provided they are at all times subject to his order, and there is no fixed period during which he has no right to demand their return. . . .  The deposit is made on his own personal responsibility, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 227 U. S. 159</a></p><p> however, and if, in case of the failure of the bank, he makes the loss good, the money deposited must necessarily become his property, and thereafter be considered and treated as such."</p>\n<p>After that decision, and before the transactions here in question, the depository act was passed and put in force, but its construction and operation were not determined by the supreme court of the state until it passed upon the case at bar.  It was then held (a) that the act made provision for general depositories, wherein moneys of the state not belonging to the educational funds were to be placed as general deposits, with the right in the depository to commingle them with other deposits and to loan them in the usual course of business, and with an absolute obligation on the depository to pay interest on them at not less than two percent per annum; (b) that the act also made provision for an active depository for the collection of checks, drafts, and the like, belonging to any state fund, whether educational or otherwise, and the safekeeping of the proceeds, subject to the treasurer\'s order, but with no right in the depository to commingle them with other deposits or to loan them, and with no specific or absolute obligation on the depository to pay interest thereon; (c) that, by contrasting the provisions relating to general depositories with those relating to the active depository, it was evident that deposits in the latter, unlike deposits in the former, were to be special, the title not passing to the depository, but remaining in the state, and (d) that the act operated, and the legislature intended, to take the educational funds out of the custom or right of the treasurer to make general deposits which was recognized in <em>Baker v. Williams Bkg. Co. supra.</em>  Then, coming to apply the act, as so construed, together with \xc2\xa7 1807, to the facts of the case as reflected by the verdict of the jury, it was further held (1) that the bank held the money as a special deposit, the title being in the state; (2) that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 227 U. S. 160</a></p><p> defendants, being in control of the bank as its officers and directors and knowing of the deposit, were to be regarded as having the money in their possession within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1807; (3) that the commingling of the money with other deposits and the using of it in paying liabilities of the bank constituted an unlawful appropriation of it; (4) that as the defendants, as controlling officers and directors of the bank, sanctioned that appropriation, knowing that the money belonged to the educational funds of the state and was held by the bank as an active depository, they thereby converted the money to their own use within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1807, even although the appropriation was for the benefit of the bank, and not of themselves personally.</p>\n<p>It will be perceived that, but for the depository act, as so construed, the deposit would have been a general one, merely creating the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the state, and the commingling and use of the money in the manner shown would not have been a crime under \xc2\xa7 1807.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the plaintiff in error contended in the supreme court of the state that the depository act was not reasonably susceptible of the construction ultimately adopted, and that to put such a construction upon it would be violative of the prohibition in the Constitution of the United States against <em>ex post facto</em> state laws.  Both phases of the contention were denied, the second necessarily failing with the first, and the plaintiff in error now assigns error upon that holding, and complains that it deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Bearing in mind what has been said, and especially that the depository act and \xc2\xa7 1807 were both in force at the time of the alleged offense, it will be perceived that the real complaint which we are asked to consider is not that the supreme court of the state in any wise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 227 U. S. 161</a></p><p> rested its judgment upon a statute passed after the time of the alleged offense, but only that it misconstrued a preexisting statute to the disadvantage of the plaintiff in error, and that such a decision is an <em>ex post facto</em> law within the meaning of Article I, \xc2\xa7 10, of the Constitution, which declares:  "No state . . . shall pass any bill of attainder, <em>ex post facto</em> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts."</p>\n<p>But that provision of the Constitution, according to the natural import of its terms, is a restraint upon legislative power, and concerns the making of laws, not their construction by the courts.  It has been so regarded from the beginning.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/386/case.html">Calder v. Bull,</a></span></em> 3 Dall. 386, one of the first cases in which the provision was considered, it was spoken of as reaching legislative, but not judicial, acts, and in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/10/87/case.html">Fletcher v. Peck,</a></span></em> 6 Cranch 87,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/10/87/case.html#138">10 U. S. 138</a></span>, Chief Justice Marshall said of it:  "In this form, the power of the legislature over the lives and fortunes of individuals is expressly restrained."  True, neither of those cases turned upon the question whether the words "no state shall pass a law" embrace a decision of a court construing a statute, but that question was both presented and decided in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/46/317/case.html">Commercial Bank v. Buckingham,</a></span></em> 5 How. 317.  There, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in an action upon a contract, had put upon two preexisting statutes of the state a construction which was claimed to be unreasonable and to impair the obligation of the contract, and it was sought to have that decision reviewed by this Court on the ground that it denied a right secured by the Constitution of the United States.  But the writ of error was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, because, as was said in the opinion (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/46/317/case.html#342">46 U. S. 342</a></span>):</p>\n<p>"If this Court were to assume jurisdiction of this case, it is evident that the question submitted for our decision would be not whether the statutes of Ohio are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, but whether the Supreme Court of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 227 U. S. 162</a></p><p> Ohio has erred in its construction of them.  It is the peculiar province and privilege of the state courts to construe their own statutes, and it is no part of the functions of this Court to review their decisions or assume jurisdiction over them on the pretense that their judgments have impaired the obligation of contracts.  The power delegated to us is for the restraint of unconstitutional legislation by the states, and not for the correction of alleged errors committed by their judiciary."</p>\n<p>A like question was presented, and similarly disposed of, in <em>New Orleans Water Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/18/case.html">125 U. S. 18</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/18/case.html#30">125 U. S. 30</a></span>, where it was said:</p>\n<p>"In order to come within the provision of the Constitution of the United States which declares that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, not only must the obligation of a contract have been impaired, but it must have been impaired by a law of the state.  The prohibition is aimed at the legislative power of the state, and not at the decisions of its courts, or the acts of administrative or executive boards or officers, or the doings of corporations or individuals."</p>\n<p>And in <em>Brown v. Smart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/145/454/case.html">145 U. S. 454</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/145/454/case.html#458">145 U. S. 458</a></span>, where a decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, expounding a statute of that state, was challenged as impairing the obligation of a contract made after the statute came into existence, it was held that the decision "was not a law" within the meaning of the provision against the impairment of contractual obligations by state laws.  Many other cases give effect to this ruling, but it will suffice to cite, from among them, <em>Central Land Co. v. Laidley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/159/103/case.html">159 U.

S. 163</a></p><p> every form in which the legislative power of a state is exerted, whether it be a constitution, a constitutional amendment, an enactment of the legislature, a bylaw or ordinance of a municipal corporation, or a regulation or order of some other instrumentality of the state exercising delegated legislative authority.  <em>New Orleans Water Works Co. v.

Of course, the ruling here in question was by an instrumentality of the state; but as its purpose was not to prescribe a new law for the future, but only to apply to a completed transaction laws which were in force at the time, it is quite plain that the ruling was a judicial act, and not an exercise of legislative authority.  As was said in <em>Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/210/case.html">211 U. S. 210</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/210/case.html#226">211 U.

That is its purpose and end.  Legislation, on the other hand, looks to the future, and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power."</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in error cites the cases of <em>Kring v. Missouri,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/107/221/case.html">107 U. S. 221</a></span>; <em>Muhlker v.

But none of those cases, when rightly considered, sustains that position.
