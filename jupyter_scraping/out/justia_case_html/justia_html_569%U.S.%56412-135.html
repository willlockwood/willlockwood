Because the parties \xe2\x80\x9cbargained for the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s construction of their agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d an arbitral decision \xe2\x80\x9ceven arguably construing or applying the contract\xe2\x80\x9d must stand, regardless of a court\xe2\x80\x99s view of its (de)merits.  Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57\n.  Thus, the sole question on judicial review is whether the arbitrator interpreted the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract, not whether he construed it correctly.  Here, the arbitrator twice did what the parties asked: He considered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to permit class proceedings.

There, the parties stipulated that they had not reached an agreement on class arbitration, so the arbitrators did not construe the contract, and did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings.  This Court thus found not that they had misinterpreted the contract but that they had abandoned their interpretive role.  Here, in stark contrast, the arbitrator did construe the contract, and did find an agreement to permit class arbitration.  So to overturn his decision, this Court would have to find that he misapprehended the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  But \xc2\xa710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task poorly.  Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s remaining arguments go to the merits of the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s contract interpretation and are thus irrelevant under \xc2\xa710(a)(4).

The parties in Stolt-Nielsen had stipulated that they had never reached an agreement on class arbitration.  Relying on \xc2\xa710(a)(4), we vacated the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 decision approving class proceedings because, in the absence of such an agreement, the arbitrators had \xe2\x80\x9csimply .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. imposed [their] own view of sound policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 672.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOxford immediately asked the arbitrator to reconsider his decision on class arbitration in light of Stolt-Nielsen.  The arbitrator issued a new opinion holding that Stolt-Nielsen had no effect on the case because this agreement authorized class arbitration.  Unlike in Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator explained, the parties here disputed the meaning of their contract; he had therefore been required \xe2\x80\x9cto construe the arbitration clause in the ordinary way to glean the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 72.  And in performing that task, the arbitrator continued, he had \xe2\x80\x9cfound that the arbitration clause unambiguously evinced an intention to allow class arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 70.  The arbitrator con-cluded by reconfirming his reasons for so construing the clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOxford then returned to federal court, renewing its effort to vacate the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision under \xc2\xa710(a)(4).  Once again, the District Court denied the motion, and the Third Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals first underscored the limited scope of judicial review that \xc2\xa710(a)(4) allows: So long as an arbitrator \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a good faith attempt\xe2\x80\x9d to interpret a contract, \xe2\x80\x9ceven serious errors of law or fact will not subject his award to vacatur.\xe2\x80\x9d  675 F. 3d 215, 220 (2012).  Oxford could not prevail under that standard, the court held, because the arbitrator had \xe2\x80\x9cendeavored to give effect to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9carticulate[d] a contractual basis for his decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 223\xe2\x80\x93224.

Because the parties \xe2\x80\x9cbargained for the arbitra-tor\xe2\x80\x99s construction of their agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d an arbitral decision \xe2\x80\x9ceven arguably construing or applying the contract\xe2\x80\x9d must stand, regardless of a court\xe2\x80\x99s view of its (de)merits.

The arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s first ruling recited the \xe2\x80\x9cquestion of construction\xe2\x80\x9d the parties had submitted to him: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [their] Agreement allows for class action arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  To resolve that matter, the arbitrator focused on the arbitration clause\xe2\x80\x99s text, analyzing (whether correctly or not makes no difference) the scope of both what it barred from court and what it sent to arbitration.  The arbitrator concluded, based on that textual exegesis, that the clause \xe2\x80\x9con its face .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. expresses the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent that class action arbitration can be maintained.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 32.  When Oxford requested reconsideration in light of Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator explained that his prior decision was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned solely with the par-ties\xe2\x80\x99 intent as evidenced by the words of the arbitration clause itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 69.  He then ran through his textual analysis again, and reiterated his conclusion: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he text of the clause itself authorizes\xe2\x80\x9d class arbitration.  Id., at 73.  Twice, then, the arbitrator did what the parties had asked: He considered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to permit class proceedings.  That suffices to show that the arbitrator did not \xe2\x80\x9cexceed[\xc2\xa0] [his] powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa710(a)(4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOxford\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view relies principally on Stolt-Nielsen.  As noted earlier, we found there that an arbitration panel exceeded its powers under \xc2\xa710(a)(4) when it ordered a party to submit to class arbitration.  See supra, at 3.  Oxford takes that decision to mean that \xe2\x80\x9ceven the \xe2\x80\x98high hurdle\xe2\x80\x99 of Section 10(a)(4) review is overcome when an arbitrator imposes class arbitration without a sufficient contractual basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 5 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 671).  Under Stolt-Nielson, Oxford asserts, a court may thus vacate \xe2\x80\x9cas ultra vires\xe2\x80\x9d an arbitral decision like this one for misconstruing a contract to approve class proceedings.

The parties in Stolt-Nielsen had entered into an unusual stipulation that they had never reached an agreement on class arbitration.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 668\xe2\x80\x93669, 673.  In that circumstance, we noted, the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was not\xe2\x80\x94indeed, could not have been\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbased on a determination regarding the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 673, n. 4; see id., at 676 (\xe2\x80\x9cTh[e] stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor, we continued, did the panel attempt to ascertain whether federal or state law established a \xe2\x80\x9cdefault rule\xe2\x80\x9d to take effect absent an agreement.  Id., at 673.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthe panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy\xe2\x80\x9d when it ordered class proceedings.  Id., at 675.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe task of an arbitrator,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cis to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 672.  In \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] its own policy choice,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel \xe2\x80\x9cthus exceeded its powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 677.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe contrast with this case is stark.  In Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrators did not construe the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract, and did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings.  So in setting aside the arbitrators\xe2\x80\x99 decision, we found not that they had misinterpreted the contract, but that they had abandoned their interpretive role.  Here, the arbitrator did construe the contract (focusing, per usual, on its language), and did find an agreement to permit class arbitration. So to overturn his decision, we would have to rely on a finding that he misapprehended the par-ties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  But \xc2\xa710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task poorly.  Stolt-Nielsen and this case thus fall on opposite sides of the line that \xc2\xa710(a)(4) draws to delimit judicial review of arbitral decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe remainder of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s argument addresses merely the merits: The arbitrator, Oxford contends at length, badly misunderstood the contract\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause.  See Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9328.  The key text, again, goes as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cNo civil action concerning any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be instituted before any court, and all such disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  The arbitrator thought that clause sent to arbitration all \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action[s]\xe2\x80\x9d barred from court, and viewed class actions as falling within that category.  See supra, at 2.  But Oxford points out that the provision submits to arbitration not any \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action[s],\xe2\x80\x9d but instead any \xe2\x80\x9cdispute arising under\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement.  And in any event, Oxford claims, a class action is not a form of \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action,\xe2\x80\x9d as the arbitrator thought, but merely a procedural device that may be available in a court.  At bottom, Oxford maintains, this is a garden-variety arbi-tration clause, lacking any of the terms or features that would indicate an agreement to use class procedures.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reject this argument because, and only because, it is not properly addressed to a court.  Nothing we say in this opinion should be taken to reflect any agreement with the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s contract interpretation, or any quarrel with Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading.  All we say is that convincing a court of an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s error\xe2\x80\x94even his grave error\xe2\x80\x94is not enough.  So long as the arbitrator was \xe2\x80\x9carguably construing\xe2\x80\x9d the contract\xe2\x80\x94which this one was\xe2\x80\x94a court may not correct his mistakes under \xc2\xa710(a)(4).  Eastern Associated Coal, 531 U. S., at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The potential for those mistakes is the price of agreeing to arbitration.  As we have held before, we hold again: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s construction [of the contract] which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\xe2\x80\x9d  Enterprise Wheel, 363 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 599.  The arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s construction holds, however good, bad, or ugly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live with that choice.  Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbitrator should determine what their contract meant, including whether its terms approved class arbitration.  The arbitrator did what the parties requested: He provided an interpretation of the contract resolving that disputed issue.  His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe mistakenly so.  But still, Oxford does not get to rerun the matter in a court.  Under \xc2\xa710(a)(4), the question for a judge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract correctly, but whether he construed it at all.  Because he did, and therefore did not \xe2\x80\x9cexceed his powers,\xe2\x80\x9d we cannot give Oxford the relief it wants.  We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\nIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Compare 675 F.\xc2\xa03d 215 (CA3 2012) (case below) (vacatur not proper), and Jock v.

AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, \n.  Stolt-Nielsen made clear that this Court has not yet decided whether the availability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 680.  But this case gives us no opportunity to do so because Oxford agreed that the arbitrator should determine whether its contract with Sutter authorized class procedures.  See Brief for Petitioner 38, n.\xc2\xa09 (conceding this point).  Indeed, Oxford submitted that issue to the arbitrator not once, but twice\xe2\x80\x94and the second time after Stolt-Nielsen flagged that it might be a question of arbitrability.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970676">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93135\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tOXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC, PETITIONER v.

The Court accordingly refuses to set aside the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s ruling because he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arguably construing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the contract\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d when he allowed respondent to proceed on a classwide basis.  Ante, at 8 (quoting Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57, \n62 (2000)\n).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s result follows directly from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concession and the narrow judicial review that federal law allows in arbitration cases.  See \n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut unlike petitioner, absent members of the plaintiff class never conceded that the contract authorizes the ar- bitrator to decide whether to conduct class arbitration. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.  If we were reviewing the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the contract de\xc2\xa0novo, we would have little trouble concluding that he improperly inferred \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from the fact of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stolt-Nielsen S.\xc2\xa0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\xe2\x80\x99l Corp., \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 662, \n685 (2010)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith no reason to think that the absent class members ever agreed to class arbitration, it is far from clear that they will be bound by the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate resolution of this dispute.  Arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cis a matter of consent, not coercion,\xe2\x80\x9d Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 468, \n479 (1989)\n, and the absent members of the plaintiff class have not submitted themselves to this arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority in any way.  It is true that they signed contracts with arbitration clauses materially identical to those signed by the plaintiff who brought this suit.  But an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous interpretation of contracts that do not authorize class arbitration cannot bind someone who has not authorized the arbitrator to make that determination.  As the Court explains, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n arbitrator may employ class procedures only if the parties have authorized them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 1.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe distribution of opt-out notices does not cure this fundamental flaw in the class arbitration proceeding in this case.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]rbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938, \n943 (1995)\n, and an offeree\xe2\x80\x99s silence does not normally modify the terms of a contract, 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa769(1) (1979).  Accord- ingly, at least where absent class members have not been required to opt in, it is difficult to see how an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision to conduct class proceedings could bind absent class members who have not authorized the arbitrator to decide on a classwide basis which arbitration procedures are to be used.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClass arbitrations that are vulnerable to collateral at- tack allow absent class members to unfairly claim the \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit from a favorable judgment without subjecting themselves to the binding effect of an unfavorable one,\xe2\x80\x9d American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v. Utah, \n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538\n\xe2\x80\x93547 (1974).   In the absence of concessions like Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s, this possibility should give courts pause before concluding that the availability of class arbitration is a question the arbitrator should decide.  But because that argument was not available to petitioner in light of its concession below, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
