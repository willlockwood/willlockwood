Iqbal filed a <em>Bivens </em>action against numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  See <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>.  The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that petitioners designated Iqbal a person \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest\xe2\x80\x9d on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments; that the FBI, under Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s direction, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th investigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the prohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and that Ashcroft was the policy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect\xe2\x80\x9d and Mueller was \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental\xe2\x80\x9d in its adoption and execution.  After the District Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order doctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.  Affirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had jurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html">550 U. S. 544</a>, for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  Concluding that <em>Twombly</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cflexible plausibility standard\xe2\x80\x9d obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual allegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable in the context of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 appeal, the court held that Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was adequate to allege petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss.

The doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s applicability in this context is well established; an order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d under 28 U.

Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <em>Bivens</em> and \xc2\xa71983 suits, see, <em>e.g., Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U.

Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]etailed factual allegations\xe2\x80\x9d are not required, <em>Twombly,</em> 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \xe2\x80\x9cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  <em>Id.,</em> at 556.  Two working principles underlie <em>Twombly.</em>  First, the tenet that a court must accept a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action\xe2\x80\x99s elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.  <em>Id.,</em> at 555.  Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience and common sense.  <em>Id., </em>at 556.  A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying allegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s framework, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings do not comply with Rule 8 under <em>Twombly.  </em>Several of his allegations\xe2\x80\x94that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that Ashcroft was that policy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect\xe2\x80\x9d; and that Mueller was \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental\xe2\x80\x9d in its adoption and execution\xe2\x80\x94are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  Moreover, the factual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft approved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that petitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds.  Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  Even if the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees categorized as \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest,\xe2\x80\x9d but the complaint does not contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory factors.

Because <em>Twombly</em> interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn governs the pleading standard \xe2\x80\x9cin all civil actions,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 1, the case applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550 U.

The question presented by a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed on the discovery process.  <em>Twombly</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 559.  And because Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.

In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials.  Respondent claims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while in federal custody.  To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numerous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case now before us.  As to these two petitioners, the complaint alleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the District Court petitioners raised the defense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit, contending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim against them.  The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 official status at the times in question.  Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The court, without discussion, assumed it had jurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s account of his prison ordeal could, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors.  But the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors are not before us here.  This case instead turns on a narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the District Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states a claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights.  We hold respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings are insufficient.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the 2001 attacks, the FBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an investigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent them from attacking anew.  The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor.  By September 18 \xe2\x80\x9cthe FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks 1, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (Apr. 2003) (hereinafter OIG Report), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf (as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to terrorism in general.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1.  Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cof \xe2\x80\x98high interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the investigation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 111.  The high-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions designed to prevent them from communicating with the general prison population or the outside world.  <em>Id.,</em> at 112\xe2\x80\x93113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent was one of the detainees.  According to his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of fraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States.  <em>Iqbal</em> v. <em>Hasty, </em>490 F.\xc2\xa03d 143, 147\xe2\x80\x93148 (CA2 2007).  Pending trial for those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York.  Respondent was designated a person \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest\xe2\x80\x9d to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was placed in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU).  <em>Id.,</em> at 148.  As the facility\xe2\x80\x99s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison regulations.  <em>Ibid.  </em>ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer escort.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his native Pakistan.  <em>Id.,</em> at 149.  He then filed a <em>Bivens</em> action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal officials and 19 \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Doe\xe2\x80\x9d federal corrections officers.  See <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971).  The defendants range from the correctional officers who had day-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his confinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to petitioners\xe2\x80\x94officials who were at the highest level of the federal law enforcement hierarchy.  First Amended Complaint in No. 04\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x931809 (JG)(JA), \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb61011, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (hereinafter Complaint).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not challenge respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or his confinement in the MDC\xe2\x80\x99s general prison population.  Rather, it concentrates on his treatment while confined to the ADMAX SHU.  The complaint sets forth various claims against defendants who are not before us.  For instance, the complaint alleges that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s jailors \xe2\x80\x9ckicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across\xe2\x80\x9d his cell without justification, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb6113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when he posed no safety risk to himself or others, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6143\xe2\x80\x93145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and other Muslims pray because there would be \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o prayers for terrorists,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb6154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The allegations against petitioners are the only ones relevant here.  The complaint contends that petitioners designated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.  The complaint alleges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \xe2\x80\xa6 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb647, at 164a.  It further alleges that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \xe2\x80\x98cleared\xe2\x80\x99 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb669, at 168a.  Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9ceach knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\xe2\x80\x9d respondent to harsh conditions of confinement \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb696, at 172a\xe2\x80\x93173a.  The pleading names Ashcroft as the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect\xe2\x80\x9d of the policy, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xb610, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb611, at 157a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct.  The District Court denied their motion.  Accepting all of the allegations in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint as true, the court held that \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners.  <em>Id.,</em> at 136a\xe2\x80\x93137a (relying on <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a> (1957)).  Invoking the collateral-order doctrine petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html"></a><a href="/us/550/544/index.html">550 U.

Acknowledging that <em>Twombly</em> retired the <em>Conley</em> no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion discussed at length how to apply this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstandard for assessing the adequacy of pleadings.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 155.  It concluded that <em>Twombly</em> called for a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible \xe2\x80\x98plausibility standard,\xe2\x80\x99 which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim <em>plausible.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 157\xe2\x80\x93158.  The court found that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 appeal did not present one of \xe2\x80\x9cthose contexts\xe2\x80\x9d requiring amplification.  As a consequence, it held respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pleading adequate to allege petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.  <em>Id.,</em> at 174.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Cabranes concurred.  He agreed that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion of the relevant pleading standards reflect[ed] the uneasy compromise \xe2\x80\xa6 between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of government as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 178 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at the prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government officials\xe2\x80\x94entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and charged with responding to \xe2\x80\x9ca national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to the burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s.  <em>Id.,</em> at 179.  Reluctant to vindicate that concern as a member of the Court of Appeals, <em>ibid.,</em> Judge Cabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading standard \xe2\x80\x9cat the earliest opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 178.  We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first address whether the Court of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss.  Respondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue.  We are not free to pretermit the question.  Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt.  <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U.

According to respondent, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss is not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.

Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of district-court orders are reviewable \xe2\x80\x9cthough short of final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid.  </em>The orders within this narrow category \xe2\x80\x9care immediately appealable because they \xe2\x80\x98finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U.

This is so because qualified immunity\xe2\x80\x94which shields Government officials \xe2\x80\x9cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U.

S., at 526.  Provided it \xe2\x80\x9cturns on an issue of law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 530, a district-court order denying qualified immunity \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conclusively determine[s]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery; is \xe2\x80\x9cconceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim\xe2\x80\x9d; and would prove \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 527528 (citing <em>Cohen, supra,</em> at 546).  As a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in <em>Cohen</em>.  But the applicability of the doctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this Court has been careful to say that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71291.  <em>Behrens, </em>516 U.

The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and rejected the defense of qualified immunity.  It was therefore a final decision \xe2\x80\x9csubject to immediate appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid</em>.  Respondent says that \xe2\x80\x9ca qualified immunity appeal based solely on the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief).  In other words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation but that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings.  Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Hartman</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/250/index.html">547 U. S. 250</a> (2006), the Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified immunity.  The legal issue decided in <em>Hartman</em> concerned the elements a plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cmust plead and prove in order to win\xe2\x80\x9d a First Amendment retaliation claim.  <em>Id.,</em> at 257, n.\xc2\xa05.  Similarly, two Terms ago in <em>Wilkie</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/537/index.html">551 U. S. 537</a> (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying qualified immunity.  The legal issue there was whether a <em>Bivens</em> action can be employed to challenge interference with property rights.  551 U. S., at 549, n.\xc2\xa04.  These cases cannot be squared with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the collateral-order doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate issu[e]\xe2\x80\x9d whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation of clearly established law while excluding the question whether the facts pleaded establish such a violation.  Iqbal Brief 15.  Indeed, the latter question is even more clearly within the category of appealable decisions than the questions presented in <em>Hartman</em> and <em>Wilkie</em>, since whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded.  In that sense the sufficiency of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings is both \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably intertwined with,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Swint</em> v. <em>Chambers County Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/35/index.html">514 U. S. 35</a>, 51 (1995), and \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly implicated by,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hartman, supra</em>, at 257, n.\xc2\xa05, the qualified immunity defense.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent counters that our holding in <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/304/index.html">515 U. S. 304</a>, confirms the want of subject-matter jurisdiction here.  That is incorrect.  The allegation in <em>Johnson</em> was that five defendants, all of them police officers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff.  <em>Johnson</em> considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe appealability of a portion of\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s summary judgment order that, \xe2\x80\x9cthough entered in a \xe2\x80\x98qualified immunity\xe2\x80\x99 case, determine[d] only\xe2\x80\x9d that there was a genuine issue of material fact that three of the defendants participated in the beating.  <em>Id.,</em> at 313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In finding that order not a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71291, the <em>Johnson </em>Court cited <em>Mitchell</em> for the proposition that only decisions turning \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>on an issue of law</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are subject to immediate appeal.  515 U. S., at 313<em>. </em> Though determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits near the law-fact divide.  Or as we said in <em>Johnson</em>, it is a \xe2\x80\x9cfact-related\xe2\x80\x9d legal inquiry.  <em>Id.,</em> at 314.  To conduct it, a court of appeals may be required to consult a \xe2\x80\x9cvast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 316.  That process generally involves matters more within a district court\xe2\x80\x99s ken and may replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal following final judgment.  <em>Ibid. </em> Finding those concerns predominant, <em>Johnson </em>held that the collateral orders that are \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Mitchell</em> turn on \xe2\x80\x9cabstract,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cfact-based,\xe2\x80\x9d issues of law.  515 U. S., at 317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concerns that animated the decision in <em>Johnson</em> are absent when an appellate court considers the disposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings.  True, the categories of \xe2\x80\x9cfact-based\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabstract\xe2\x80\x9d legal questions used to guide the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Johnson</em> are not well defined.  Here, however, the order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss falls well within the latter class.  Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only the allegations contained within the four corners of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint; resort to a \xe2\x80\x9cvast pretrial record\xe2\x80\x9d on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss was unnecessary.  <em>Id.,</em> at 316.  And determining whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint has the \xe2\x80\x9cheft\xe2\x80\x9d to state a claim is a task well within an appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s core competency.  <em>Twombly,</em> 550 U. S., at 557.  Evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfact-based\xe2\x80\x9d question of law, so the problem the Court sought to avoid in <em>Johnson</em> is not implicated here.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine over which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction.  We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Twombly, supra, </em>at 553\xe2\x80\x93554, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the complaint.  Here too we begin by taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Bivens</em>\xe2\x80\x94proceeding on the theory that a right suggests a remedy\xe2\x80\x94this Court \xe2\x80\x9crecognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/61/index.html">534 U. S. 61</a>, 66 (2001).  Because implied causes of action are disfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend <em>Bivens</em> liability \xe2\x80\x9cto any new context or new category of defendants.\xe2\x80\x9d  534 U. S., at 68.  See also <em>Wilkie</em>, 551 U. S., at 549\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93550.  That reluctance might well have disposed of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination.  For while we have allowed a <em>Bivens</em> action to redress a violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, see <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Passman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/228/index.html">442 U. S. 228</a> (1979), we have not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise Clause.  Indeed, we have declined to extend <em>Bivens </em>to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.  <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/367/index.html">462 U. S. 367</a> (1983).  Petitioners do not press this argument, however, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment claim is actionable under <em>Bivens</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the limited settings where <em>Bivens</em> does apply, the implied cause of action is the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal analog to suits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hartman</em>, 547 U. S., at 254, n.\xc2\xa02.  Cf. <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U. S. 603</a>, 609 (1999).  Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent correctly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of <em>respondeat superior.</em>  Iqbal Brief 46 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is undisputed that supervisory <em>Bivens </em>liability cannot be established solely on a theory of <em>respondeat superior</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <em>Monell</em> v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/index.html">436 U.

Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <em>Bivens</em> and \xc2\xa71983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official\xe2\x80\x99s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The factors necessary to establish a <em>Bivens</em> violation will vary with the constitutional provision at issue.  Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose.  <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</em> v. <em>Hialeah</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/520/index.html">508 U. S. 520</a>, 540\xe2\x80\x93541 (1993) (First Amendment); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/index.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment).  Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than \xe2\x80\x9cintent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U.

It instead involves a decisionmaker\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking a course of action \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because of,\xe2\x80\x99 not merely \xe2\x80\x98in spite of,\xe2\x80\x99 [the action\xe2\x80\x99s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent disagrees.  He argues that, under a theory of \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory liability,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners can be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 use of discriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iqbal Brief 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  That is to say, respondent believes a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s mere knowledge of his subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s violating the Constitution.  We reject this argument.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conception of \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory liability\xe2\x80\x9d is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that petitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds of their agents.  In a \xc2\xa71983 suit or a <em>Bivens </em>action\xe2\x80\x94where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants\xe2\x80\x94the term \xe2\x80\x9csupervisory liability\xe2\x80\x9d is a misnomer.  Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.  In the context of determining whether there is a violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose <em>Bivens </em>liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  As the Court held in <em>Twombly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html"></a><a href="/us/550/544/index.html">550 U. S. 544</a>, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed factual allegations,\xe2\x80\x9d but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.  <em>Id</em>., at 555 (citing <em>Papasan</em> v. <em>Allain,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/265/index.html">478 U.

A pleading that offers \xe2\x80\x9clabels and conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U. S., at 555.  Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \xe2\x80\x9cnaked assertion[s]\xe2\x80\x9d devoid of \xe2\x80\x9cfurther factual enhancement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 557.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \xe2\x80\x9cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  <em>Id.,</em> at 556.  The plausibility standard is not akin to a \xe2\x80\x9cprobability requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Where a complaint pleads facts that are \xe2\x80\x9cmerely consistent with\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability, it \xe2\x80\x9cstops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \xe2\x80\x98entitlement to relief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 557 (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two working principles underlie our decision in <em>Twombly.</em>  First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.  Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 555 (Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we \xe2\x80\x9care not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.  Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.  <em>Id., </em>at 556.  Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.  490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 157\xe2\x80\x93158.  But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged\xe2\x80\x94but it has not \xe2\x80\x9cshow[n]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Twombly</em> illustrates the two-pronged approach.  There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  Recognizing that \xc2\xa71 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct \xe2\x80\x9ceffected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Copperweld Corp.</em> v. <em>Independence Tube Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/752/index.html">467 U. S. 752</a>, 775 (1984), the plaintiffs in <em>Twombly</em> flatly pleaded that the defendants \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry \xe2\x80\xa6 and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U. S., at 551 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The complaint also alleged that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cparallel course of conduct \xe2\x80\xa6 to prevent competition\xe2\x80\x9d and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged.  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint deficient under Rule 8.  In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of an unlawful agreement was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legal conclusion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth.  <em>Id., </em>at 555.<em> </em>Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce.  The Court next addressed the \xe2\x80\x9cnub\xe2\x80\x9d of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint\xe2\x80\x94the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior\xe2\x80\x94to determine whether it gave rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cplausible suggestion of conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 565\xe2\x80\x93566.  Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior.  <em>Id.</em>, at 567.  Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint must be dismissed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 570.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Twombly</em>\xe2\x80\x99s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint has not \xe2\x80\x9cnudged [his] claims\xe2\x80\x9d of invidious discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  Respondent pleads that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]\xe2\x80\x9d to harsh conditions of confinement \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a\xe2\x80\x93174a.  The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect\xe2\x80\x9d of this invidious policy, id., </em>\xc2\xb610, at 157a, and that Mueller was \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental\xe2\x80\x9d in adopting and executing it, <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb611, at 157a.  These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <em>Twombly</em>, amount to nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x9cformulaic recitation of the elements\xe2\x80\x9d of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U. S., at 555, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because of,\xe2\x80\x99 not merely \xe2\x80\x98in spite of,\xe2\x80\x99 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Feeney</em>, 442 U. S., at 279. As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  <em>Twombly</em>, <em>supra,</em> 550 U. S.,<em> </em>at 554\xe2\x80\x93555.  To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical.  We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in <em>Twombly</em> rejected the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 express allegation of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 551, because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained.  It is the conclusory nature of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider the factual allegations in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.  The complaint alleges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \xe2\x80\xa6 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a.  It further claims that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \xe2\x80\x98cleared\xe2\x80\x99 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb669, at 168a.  Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 purposefully designating detainees \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest\xe2\x80\x9d because of their race, religion, or national origin.  But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group.  Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim\xe2\x80\x94Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x94and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples.  It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts.  As between that \xe2\x80\x9cobvious alternative explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for the arrests, <em>Twombly, supra,</em> at 567, and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief.  It is important to recall that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy of holding post-September-11th detainees\xe2\x80\x9d in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb669, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a.  To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest\xe2\x80\x9d because of their race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This the complaint fails to do.  Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of \xe2\x80\x9cof high interest\xe2\x80\x9d for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving \xe2\x80\x9crestrictive conditions of confinement\xe2\x80\x9d for post-September-11 detainees until they were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cleared\xe2\x80\x99 by the FBI.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin.  All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity.  Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional obligations.  He would need to allege more by way of factual content to \xe2\x80\x9cnudg[e]\xe2\x80\x9d his claim of purposeful discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Twombly</em>, 550 U. S.,<em> </em>at 570.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, respondent can attempt to draw certain contrasts between the pleadings the Court considered in <em>Twombly</em> and the pleadings at issue here.  In <em>Twombly</em>, the complaint alleged general wrongdoing that extended over a period of years, <em>id.,</em> at 551, whereas here the complaint alleges discrete wrongs\xe2\x80\x94for instance, beatings\xe2\x80\x94by lower level Government actors.  The allegations here, if true, and if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for some inference of wrongful intent on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 part.  Despite these distinctions, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings do not suffice to state a claim.  Unlike in <em>Twombly</em>, where the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior</em> could bind the corporate defendant, here, as we have noted, petitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic.  Yet respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint does not contain any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory state of mind.  His pleadings thus do not meet the standard necessary to comply with Rule 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint against the defendants who are not before us.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here.  Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent offers three arguments that bear on our disposition of his case, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent first says that our decision in <em>Twombly</em> should be limited to pleadings made in the context of an antitrust dispute.  Iqbal Brief 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  This argument is not supported by <em>Twombly </em>and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Though <em>Twombly</em> determined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in antitrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and application of Rule 8.  550 U. S., at 554.  That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard \xe2\x80\x9cin all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1.  Our decision in <em>Twombly</em> expounded the pleading standard for \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike.  See 550 U. S., at 555\xe2\x80\x93556, and n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has \xe2\x80\x9cinstructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve\xe2\x80\x9d petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 defense of qualified immunity \xe2\x80\x9cas much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Iqbal Brief 27.  We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process.  <em>Twombly</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 559 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process through careful case management given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been on the modest side\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.  The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including \xe2\x80\x9cavoidance of disruptive discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Siegert</em> v. <em>Gilley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/226/index.html">500 U. S. 226</a>, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  There are serious and legitimate reasons for this.  If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed.  Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government.  The costs of diversion are only magnified when Government officials are charged with responding to, as Judge Cabranes aptly put it, \xe2\x80\x9ca national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 179.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants.  It is quite likely that, when discovery as to the other parties proceeds, it would prove necessary for petitioners and their counsel to participate in the process to ensure the case does not develop in a misleading or slanted way that causes prejudice to their position.  Even if petitioners are not yet themselves subject to discovery orders, then, they would not be free from the burdens of discovery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decline respondent\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to relax the pleading requirements on the ground that the Court of Appeals promises petitioners minimally intrusive discovery.  That promise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading context, where we are impelled to give real content to the concept of qualified immunity for high-level officials who must be neither deterred nor detracted from the vigorous performance of their duties.  Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory intent \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally,\xe2\x80\x9d which he equates with a conclusory allegation.  Iqbal Brief 32 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9).  It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him \xe2\x80\x9con account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a\xe2\x80\x93173a.  Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint would survive petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss.  But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading \xe2\x80\x9cfraud or mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d while allowing \xe2\x80\x9c[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\xe2\x80\x99s mind [to] be alleged generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally\xe2\x80\x9d is a relative term.  In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake.  Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.  It does not give him license to evade the less rigid\xe2\x80\x94though still operative\xe2\x80\x94strictures of Rule 8.  See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71301, p.\xc2\xa0291 (3d ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of a condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent overriding considerations pressing for a specificity requirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mistake, the general \xe2\x80\x98short and plain statement of the claim\xe2\x80\x99 mandate in Rule 8(a) \xe2\x80\xa6 should control the second sentence of Rule 9(b)\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Rule 8 does not empower respondent to plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix the label \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral allegation,\xe2\x80\x9d and expect his complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination against petitioners.

Ashcroft and Mueller then asked this Court to grant certiorari on two questions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c1.\xe2\x80\x82Whether a conclusory allegation that a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts purportedly committed by subordinate officials is sufficient to state individual-capacity claims against those officials under <em>Bivens</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c2.\xe2\x80\x82Whether a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official may be held personally liable for the allegedly unconstitutional acts of subordinate officials on the ground that, as high-level supervisors, they had constructive notice of the discrimination allegedly carried out by such subordinate officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. I.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Court granted certiorari on both questions.  The first is about pleading; the second goes to the liability standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the first question, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask whether \xe2\x80\x9ca cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts committed by subordinate officials\xe2\x80\x9d was subject to liability under <em>Bivens.</em>  In fact, they conceded in their petition for certiorari that they would be liable if they had \xe2\x80\x9cactual knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination by their subordinates and exhibited \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to that discrimination.  Pet. for Cert. 29 (quoting <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/825/index.html">511 U. S. 825</a>, 837 (1994)).  Instead, they asked the Court to address whether Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s allegations against them (which they call conclusory) were sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2), and in particular whether the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision in <em>Twombly</em> construing that rule.  Pet. for Cert. 11\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the second question, Ashcroft and Mueller asked this Court to say whether they could be held personally liable for the actions of their subordinates based on the theory that they had constructive notice of their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 unconstitutional conduct.  <em>Id.</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9333.  This was an odd question to pose, since Iqbal has never claimed that Ashcroft and Mueller are liable on a constructive notice theory.  Be that as it may, the second question challenged only one possible ground for imposing supervisory liability under <em>Bivens</em>.  In sum, both questions assumed that a defendant could raise a <em>Bivens</em> claim on theories of supervisory liability other than constructive notice, and neither question asked the parties or the Court to address the elements of such liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The briefing at the merits stage was no different.  Ashcroft and Mueller argued that the factual allegations in Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint were insufficient to overcome their claim of qualified immunity; they also contended that they could not be held liable on a theory of constructive notice.  Again they conceded, however, that they would be subject to supervisory liability if they \xe2\x80\x9chad actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being \xe2\x80\x98of high interest\xe2\x80\x99 and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 50; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Iqbal argued that the allegations in his complaint were sufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) and<em> Twombly</em>, and conceded that as a matter of law he could not recover under a theory of <em>respondeat superior</em>.  See Brief for Respondent Iqbal 46.  Thus, the parties agreed as to a proper standard of supervisory liability, and the disputed question was whether Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without acknowledging the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement as to the standard of supervisory liability, the Court asserts that it must <em>sua sponte</em> decide the scope of supervisory liability here.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.<em> </em>I agree that, absent Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s concession, that determination would have to be made; without knowing the elements of a supervisory liability claim, there would be no way to determine whether a plaintiff had made factual allegations amounting to grounds for relief on that claim.  See <em>Twombly</em>, 550 U. S., at 557\xe2\x80\x93558.  But deciding the scope of supervisory <em>Bivens</em> liability in this case is uncalled for.  There are several reasons, starting with the position Ashcroft and Mueller have taken and following from it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Ashcroft and Mueller have, as noted, made the critical concession that a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of a subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional conduct and deliberate indifference to that conduct are grounds for <em>Bivens </em>liability.  Iqbal seeks to recover on a theory that Ashcroft and Mueller at least knowingly acquiesced (and maybe more than acquiesced) in the discriminatory acts of their subordinates; if he can show this, he will satisfy Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s own test for supervisory liability.  See <em>Farmer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 842 (explaining that a prison official acts with \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate indifference\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cthe official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do not normally override a party\xe2\x80\x99s concession, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>International Business Machines Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/843/index.html">517 U. S. 843</a>, 855 (1996) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would be inappropriate for us to [e]xamine in this case, without the benefit of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefing,\xe2\x80\x9d an issue the Government had conceded), and doing so is especially inappropriate when, as here, the issue is unnecessary to decide the case, see <em>infra</em>, at 8.  I would therefore accept Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s concession for purposes of this case and proceed to consider whether the complaint alleges at least knowledge and deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, because of the concession, we have received no briefing or argument on the proper scope of supervisory liability, much less the full-dress argument we normally require.  <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a>, 676\xe2\x80\x93677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  We consequently are in no position to decide the precise contours of supervisory liability here, this issue being a complicated one that has divided the Courts of Appeals.  See <em>infra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  This Court recently remarked on the danger of \xe2\x80\x9cbad decisionmaking\xe2\x80\x9d when the briefing on a question is \xe2\x80\x9cwoefully inadequate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14), yet today the majority answers a question with no briefing at all.  The attendant risk of error is palpable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is most unfair to Iqbal.  He was entitled to rely on Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s concession, both in their petition for certiorari and in their merits briefs, that they could be held liable on a theory of knowledge and deliberate indifference.  By overriding that concession, the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be heard on the question.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, does ignore the concession.  According to the majority, because Iqbal concededly cannot recover on a theory of <em>respondeat superior</em>, it follows that he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory liability.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  The majority says that in a <em>Bivens</em> action, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere masters do not answer for the torts of their servants,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe term \xe2\x80\x98supervisory liability\xe2\x80\x99 is a misnomer,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Lest there be any mistake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the scope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating <em>Bivens </em>supervisory liability entirely.  The nature of a supervisory liability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under certain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates, and it is this very principle that the majority rejects.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]etitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dangers of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to proceed without briefing and argument are apparent in its cursory analysis, which rests on the assumption that only two outcomes are possible here: <em>respondeat superior </em>liability, in which \xe2\x80\x9can employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment,\xe2\x80\x9d Restatement (Third) of Agency \xc2\xa72.04 (2005), or no supervisory liability at all.  The dichotomy is false.  Even if an employer is not liable for the actions of his employee solely because the employee was acting within the scope of employment, there still might be conditions to render a supervisor liable for the conduct of his subordinate.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Whitfield</em> v. <em>Mel\xc3\xa9ndez-Rivera</em>, 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 14 (CA1 2005) (distinguishing between <em>respondeat superior </em>liability and supervisory liability); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Eastpointe</em>, 410 F.\xc2\xa03d 810, 818 (CA6 2005) (same); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Goord</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 431, 435 (CA2 2003) (same); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Lombardi</em>, 996 F.\xc2\xa02d 954, 961 (CA8 1993) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, there is quite a spectrum of possible tests for supervisory liability: it could be imposed where a supervisor has actual knowledge of a subordinate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional violation and acquiesces, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Monroe Twp.</em>, 50 F.\xc2\xa03d 1186, 1994 (CA3 1995); <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Worland</em>, 977 F.\xc2\xa02d 1392, 1400 (CA10 1992); or where supervisors \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98know about the conduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>International Action Center</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 365 F.\xc2\xa03d 20, 28 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.) (quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Chicago</em>, 856 F.\xc2\xa02d 985, 992 (CA7 1988) (Posner, J.)); or where the supervisor has no actual knowledge of the violation but was reckless in his supervision of the subordinate, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hall</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 961; or where the supervisor was grossly negligent, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lipsett </em>v. <em>University of Puerto Rico</em>, 864 F.\xc2\xa02d 881, 902 (CA1 1988).  I am unsure what the general test for supervisory liability should be, and in the absence of briefing and argument I am in no position to choose or devise one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither is the majority, but what is most remarkable about its foray into supervisory liability is that its conclusion has no bearing on its resolution of the case.  The majority says that all of the allegations in the complaint that Ashcroft and Mueller authorized, condoned, or even were aware of their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 discriminatory conduct are \xe2\x80\x9cconclusory\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore are \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to be assumed true.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.<em> </em>As I explain below, this conclusion is unsound, but on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of Rule 8(a)(2) pleading standards, even if the majority accepted Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s concession and asked whether the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge and deliberate indifference, it presumably would still conclude that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts and must be dismissed.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 concession, the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2).  Ashcroft and Mueller admit they are liable for their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 conduct if they \xe2\x80\x9chad actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being \xe2\x80\x98of high interest\xe2\x80\x99 and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 50.  Iqbal alleges that after the September 11 attacks the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \xe2\x80\x9carrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men,\xe2\x80\x9d Complaint \xc2\xb647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, that many of these men were designated by high-ranking FBI officials as being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of high interest,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb648, 50, at 164a,<em> </em>and that in many cases, including Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s, this designation was made \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb649.  The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft was the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect of the policies and practices challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb610, at 157a, and that Mueller \xe2\x80\x9cwas instrumental in the adoption, promulgation, and implementation of the policies and practices challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb611.  According to the complaint, Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [Iqbal] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb696, at 172a\xe2\x80\x93173a.  The complaint thus alleges, at a bare minimum, that Ashcroft and Mueller knew of and condoned the discriminatory policy their subordinates carried out.  Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy.  If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cplausibility standard\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Twombly</em>.  They contend that Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials \xe2\x80\x9ctend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 28.  But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that <em>Twombly </em>demands.  <em>Twombly</em> does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true.  We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be.  See <em>Twombly</em>, 550 U. S., at 555 (a court must proceed \xe2\x80\x9con the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 556 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Neitzke</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/319/index.html">490 U. S. 319</a>, 327 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cRule 12(b)(6) does not countenance \xe2\x80\xa6 dismissals based on a judge\xe2\x80\x99s disbelief of a complaint\xe2\x80\x99s factual allegations\xe2\x80\x9d).  The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.  That is not what we have here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Twombly</em>, the relevant question is whether, assuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has stated a ground for relief that is plausible.  That is, in <em>Twombly</em>\xe2\x80\x99s words, a plaintiff must \xe2\x80\x9callege facts\xe2\x80\x9d that, taken as true, are \xe2\x80\x9csuggestive of illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  550<em> </em>U. S., at 564, n.\xc2\xa08.  In <em>Twombly</em>, we were faced with allegations of a conspiracy to violate \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act through parallel conduct.  The difficulty was that the conduct alleged was \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 554.  We held that in that sort of circumstance, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n allegation of parallel conduct is \xe2\x80\xa6 much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \xc2\xa71 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \xe2\x80\x98entitlement to relief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 557 (brackets omitted).  Here, by contrast, the allegations in the complaint are neither confined to naked legal conclusions nor consistent with legal conduct.  The complaint alleges that FBI officials discriminated against Iqbal solely on account of his race, religion, and national origin, and it alleges the knowledge and deliberate indifference that, by Ashcroft and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s own admission, are sufficient to make them liable for the illegal action.  Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint therefore contains \xe2\x80\x9cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 570.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cplausibility\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Twombly</em>.  Rather, the majority discards the allegations discussed above with regard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left considering only two statements in the complaint: that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \xe2\x80\xa6 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11,\xe2\x80\x9d Complaint \xc2\xb647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \xe2\x80\x98cleared\xe2\x80\x99 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb669, at 168a.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.  I think the majority is right in saying that these allegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9csought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, and that this produced \xe2\x80\x9ca disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18.  And I agree that the two allegations selected by the majority, standing alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to relief for unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates.  See Complaint \xc2\xb610, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (Ashcroft was the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal architect\xe2\x80\x9d of the discriminatory policy); <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb611 (Mueller was \xe2\x80\x9cinstrumental\xe2\x80\x9d in adopting and executing the discriminatory policy); <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb696, at 172a\xe2\x80\x93173a (Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\xe2\x80\x9d Iqbal to harsh conditions \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority says that these are \xe2\x80\x9cbare assertions\xe2\x80\x9d that, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch like the pleading of conspiracy in <em>Twombly</em>, amount to nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x98formulaic recitation of the elements\xe2\x80\x99 of a constitutional discrimination claim\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore are \xe2\x80\x9cnot entitled to be assumed true.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (quoting <em>Twombly</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 555).  The fallacy of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position, however, lies in looking at the relevant assertions in isolation.  The complaint contains specific allegations that, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Chief of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s International Terrorism Operations Section and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s New York Field Office implemented a policy that discriminated against Arab Muslim men, including Iqbal, solely on account of their race, religion, or national origin.  See Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb647\xe2\x80\x9353, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a\xe2\x80\x93165a.  Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as \xe2\x80\x9cconclusory\xe2\x80\x9d are no such thing.  Iqbal\xe2\x80\x99s claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\xe2\x80\x9d him to a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that \xe2\x80\x9cthey knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\xe2\x80\x9d him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint.  Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described.  Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fair notice of what the \xe2\x80\xa6 claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Twombly</em>, 550 U. S., at 555 (quoting <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a>, 47 (1957) (omission in original)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That aside, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the statements it selects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treatment of certain other allegations in the complaint as nonconclusory.  For example, the majority takes as true the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \xe2\x80\x98cleared\xe2\x80\x99 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint \xc2\xb669, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a; see <em>ante</em>, at 17.  This statement makes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held certain detainees in highly restrictive conditions, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these conditions.  If, as the majority says, these allegations are not conclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it merely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after September 11, the FBI designated Arab Muslim detainees as being of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98high interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\xe2\x80\x9d Complaint \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb648\xe2\x80\x9350, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller \xe2\x80\x9cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\xe2\x80\x9d to that discrimination, <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb696, at 172a.  By my lights, there is no principled basis for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s disregard of the allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates\xe2\x80\x99 discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Iqbal makes no claim against Ashcroft and Mueller based simply on his right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free from punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt on the fraud charges.

I write separately to point out that, like the Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation from interfering with \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper execution of the work of the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 21.  But I cannot find in that need adequate justification for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Bell Atlantic Corp.</em> v. <em>Twombly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/544/index.html">550 U. S. 544</a> (2007), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.  The law, after all, provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent unwarranted interference.  As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and \xe2\x80\x9cmindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,\xe2\x80\x9d can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials.  See <em>Iqbal </em>v. <em>Hasty</em>, 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007).  A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow discovery related to higher level government officials.  See <em>ibid</em>.  Neither the briefs nor the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us.  For this reason, as well as for the independently sufficient reasons set forth in Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
