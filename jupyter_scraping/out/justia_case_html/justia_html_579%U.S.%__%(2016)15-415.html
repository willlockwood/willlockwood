In 1966, Congress enacted an exemption from the overtime compensation requirement for \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles\xe2\x80\x9d at a covered dealership.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, \xc2\xa7209,\n\n80Stat.\n836, codified as amended at\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  Congress authorized the Department of Labor to promulgate necessary rules, regulations, or orders with respect to this new provision.  The Department exercised that authority in 1970 and issued a regulation that defined \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9can employee who is employed for the purpose of and is primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for sale of the vehicles .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which the establishment is primarily engaged in selling.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(1) (1971).  The regulation excluded service advisors, who sell repair and maintenance services but not vehicles, from the exemption.  Several courts, however, rejected the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that service advisors are not covered by the statutory exemption.  In 1978, the Department issued an opinion letter departing from its previous position and stating that service advisors could be exempt under\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  In 1987, the Department confirmed its new interpretation by amending its Field Operations Handbook to clarify that service advisors should be treated as exempt under the statute.  In 2011, however, the Department issued a final rule that followed the original 1970 regulation and interpreted the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d to mean only an employee who sells vehicles.  76 Fed. Reg. 18859.  The Department gave little explanation for its decision to abandon its decades-old practice of treating service advisors as exempt under \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioner is an automobile dealership.  Respondents are or were employed by petitioner as service advisors.  Respondents filed suit alleging that petitioner violated the FLSA by failing to pay them overtime compensation when they worked more than 40 hours in a week.

See <i>Chevron, supra, </i>at 842\xe2\x80\x93844.  When Congress authorizes an agency to proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking, that procedure is a \xe2\x80\x9cvery good indicator\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended the regulation to carry the force of law, so <i>Chevron</i> should apply.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mead Corp.</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93230.  But <i>Chevron </i>deference is not warranted where the regulation is \xe2\x80\x9cprocedurally defective\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, where the agency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">One basic procedural requirement of administrative rulemaking is that an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions.  Where the agency has failed to provide even a minimal level of analysis, its action is arbitrary and capricious and so cannot carry the force of law.  Agencies are free to change their existing policies, but in explaining its changed position, an agency must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have \xe2\x80\x9cengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FCC</i> v. <i>Fox Television Stations, Inc.</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 502\n.  An \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nexplained inconsistency\xe2\x80\x9d in agency policy is \xe2\x80\x9ca reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. </i>v.<i> Brand X Internet Services</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967\n, and an arbitrary and capricious regulation of this sort receives no <i>Chevron </i>deference.

The industry had relied since 1978 on the Department\xe2\x80\x99s position that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s overtime pay requirements, and had negotiated and structured compensation plans against this background understanding.  In light of this background, the Department needed a more reasoned explanation for its decision to depart from its existing enforcement policy.  The Department instead said almost nothing.  It did not analyze or explain why the statute should be interpreted to exempt dealership employees who sell vehicles but not dealership employees who sell services.  This lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that is inconsistent with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding earlier position results in a rule that cannot carry the force of law, and so the regulation does not receive <i>Chevron</i> deference.

The federal statute in question is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201 <i>et seq.</i>, enacted in 1938 to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barrentine</i> v. <i>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 728,\n739 (1981)\n.  Among its other provisions, the FLSA requires employers to pay overtime compensation to covered employees who work more than 40 hours in a given week.  The rate of overtime pay must be \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than one and one-half times the regular rate\xe2\x80\x9d of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pay.  \xc2\xa7207(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Five current and former service advisors brought this suit alleging that the automobile dealership where they were employed was required by the FLSA to pay them overtime wages.  The dealership contends that the position and duties of a service advisor bring these employees within \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A), which establishes an exemption from the FLSA overtime provisions for certain employees engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.  The case turns on the interpretation of this exemption.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Automobile dealerships in many communities not only sell vehicles but also sell repair and maintenance services.  Among the employees involved in providing repair and maintenance services are service advisors, partsmen, and mechanics.  Service advisors interact with customers and sell them services for their vehicles.  A service advisor\xe2\x80\x99s duties may include meeting customers; listening to their concerns about their cars; suggesting repair and maintenance services; selling new accessories or replacement parts; recording service orders; following up with customers as the services are performed (for instance, if new problems are discovered); and explaining the repair and maintenance work when customers return for their vehicles.  See App. 40\xe2\x80\x9341; see also <i>Brennan </i>v. <i>Deel Motors, Inc.</i>, 475 F.\xc2\xa02d 1095, 1096 (CA5 1973);<i> </i>29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(4) (1971).<i> </i>Partsmen obtain the vehicle parts needed to perform repair and maintenance and provide those parts to the mechanics.

Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, \xc2\xa79,\n\n75Stat.\n73.  In 1966, Congress repealed that broad exemption and replaced it with a narrower one.  The revised statute did not exempt dealership employees from the minimum wage requirement.  It also limited the exemption from the overtime compensation requirement to cover only certain employees\xe2\x80\x94in particular, \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements, or aircraft\xe2\x80\x9d at a covered dealership.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, \xc2\xa7209,\n\n80Stat.\n836.

Reg. 5896 (1970) (codified at 29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)).  The Department intended its regulation as a mere interpretive rule explaining its own views, rather than a legislative rule with the force and effect of law; and so the Department did not issue the regulation through the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 35 Fed. Reg. 5856; see also\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553(b)(A) (exempting interpretive rules from notice and comment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 1970 interpretive regulation defined \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9can employee who is employed for the purpose of and is primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for sale of the vehicles or farm implements which the establishment is primarily engaged in selling.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(1) (1971).  By limiting the statutory term to salesmen who sell vehicles or farm implements, the regulation excluded service advisors from the exemption, since a service advisor sells repair and maintenance services but not the vehicle itself.  The regulation made that exclusion explicit in a later subsection: \xe2\x80\x9cEmployees variously described as service manager, service writer, service advisor, or service salesman .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are not exempt under [the statute].  This is true despite the fact that such an employee\xe2\x80\x99s principal function may be disagnosing [<i>sic</i>] the mechanical condition of vehicles brought in for repair, writing up work orders for repairs authorized by the customer, assigning the work to various employees and directing and checking on the work of mechanics.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Three years later, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that service advisors are not covered by the statutory exemption.  <i>Deel Motors</i>, <i>supra</i>.

Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, \xc2\xa714,\n\n88Stat.\n65.  The first subsection is at issue in this case.  It exempts \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements\xe2\x80\x9d at a covered dealership.\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  The second subsection exempts \xe2\x80\x9cany salesman primarily engaged in selling trailers, boats, or aircraft\xe2\x80\x9d at a covered dealership.  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(B).  The statute thus exempts certain employees engaged in servicing automobiles, trucks, or farm implements, but not similar employees engaged in servicing trailers, boats, or aircraft.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1978, the Department issued an opinion letter departing from its previous position.  Taking a position consistent with the cases decided by the courts, the opinion letter stated that service advisors could be exempt under \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  Dept. of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter No. 1520 (WH\xe2\x80\x93467) (1978), [1978\xe2\x80\x931981 Transfer Binder] CCH Wages\xe2\x80\x93Hours Administrative Rulings \xc2\xb631,207.  The letter acknowledged that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s new policy \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ed] a change from the position set forth in section 779.372(c)(4)\xe2\x80\x9d of its 1970 regulation.  In 1987, the Department confirmed its 1978 interpretation by amending its Field Operations Handbook to clarify that service advisors should be treated as exempt under \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  It observed that some courts had interpreted the statutory exemption to cover service advisors; and it stated that, as a result of those decisions, it would \xe2\x80\x9cno longer deny the [overtime] exemption for such employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Field Operations Handbook, Insert No. 1757, 24L04\xe2\x80\x934(k)(Oct. 20, 1987), online at https://perma.cc/5GHD-KCJJ (all Internet materials as last visited June 16, 2016).  The Department again acknowledged that its new position represented a change from its 1970 regulation and stated that the regulation would \xe2\x80\x9cbe revised as soon as is practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Twenty-one years later, in 2008, the Department at last issued a notice of proposed rulemaking.  73 Fed. Reg. 43654.  The notice observed that every court that had considered the question had held service advisors to be exempt under \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A), and that the Department itself had treated service advisors as exempt since 1987.  <i>Id.</i>, at 43658\xe2\x80\x9343659.  The Department proposed to revise its regulations to accord with existing practice by interpreting the exemption in \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A) to cover service advisors.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2011, however, the Department changed course yet again.  It announced that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot proceeding with the proposed rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  76 Fed. Reg. 18833.  Instead, the Department completed its 2008 notice-and-comment rulemaking by issuing a final rule that took the opposite position from the proposed rule.  The new final rule followed the original 1970 regulation and interpreted the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d to mean only an employee who sells automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 18859 (codified at 29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(1)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Department gave little explanation for its decision to abandon its decades-old practice of treating service advisors as exempt under \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  It was also less than precise when it issued its final rule.  As described above, the 1970 regulation included a separate subsection stating in express terms that service advisors \xe2\x80\x9carenot exempt\xe2\x80\x9d under the relevant provision.  29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(4) (1971).  In promulgating the 2011 regulation, however, the Department eliminated that separate subsection.

When Congress authorizes an agency to proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking, that \xe2\x80\x9crelatively formal administrative procedure\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cvery good indicator\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress intended the regulation to carry the force of law, so <i>Chevron</i> should apply.  <i>Mead Corp.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 229\xe2\x80\x93230.  But <i>Chevron </i>deference is not warranted where the regulation is \xe2\x80\x9cprocedurally defective\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, where the agency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227; cf. <i>Long Island Care at Home, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Coke</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 158\n\xe2\x80\x93176 (2007) (rejecting challenge to procedures by which regulation was issued and affording <i>Chevron </i>deference).  Of course, a party might be foreclosed in some instances from challenging the procedures used to promulgate a given rule.  Cf., <i>e.g.,</i> <i>JEM Broadcasting Co. </i>v. <i>FCC</i>, 22 F.\xc2\xa03d 320, 324\xe2\x80\x93326 (CADC 1994); cf. also <i>Auer </i>v. <i>Robbins</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n\xe2\x80\x93459 (1997) (party cannot challenge agency\xe2\x80\x99s failure to amend its rule in light of changed circumstances without first seeking relief from the agency).  But where a proper challenge is raised to the agency procedures, and those procedures are defective, a court should not accord <i>Chevron</i> deference to the agency interpretation.  Respondents do not contest the manner in which petitioner has challenged the agency procedures here, and so this opinion assumes without deciding that the challenge was proper.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One of the basic procedural requirements of administrative rulemaking is that an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions.  The agency \xe2\x80\x9cmust examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. </i>v. <i>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29,\n43 (1983)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  That requirement is satisfied when the agency\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is clear enough that its \xe2\x80\x9cpath may reasonably be discerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bowman Transp., Inc. </i>v.<i> Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</i>,\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 281,\n286 (1974)\n.  But where the agency has failed to provide even that minimal level of analysis, its action is arbitrary and capricious and so cannot carry the force of law.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A); <i>State Farm</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Agencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</i> v. <i>Brand X Internet Services</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967\n\xe2\x80\x93982 (2005); <i>Chevron</i>, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 863\xe2\x80\x93864.  When an agency changes its existing position, it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not always provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>FCC </i>v. <i>Fox Television Stations, Inc.</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 502,\n515 (2009)\n.  But the agency must at least \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay awareness that it is changing position\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshow that there are good reasons for the new policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis deleted).  In explaining its changed position, an agency must also be cognizant that longstanding policies may have \xe2\x80\x9cengendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>;<i> </i>see also <i>Smiley</i> v. <i>Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A.</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735,\n742 (1996)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn such cases it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Fox Television Stations</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.  It follows that an \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nexplained inconsistency\xe2\x80\x9d in agency policy is \xe2\x80\x9ca reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brand X</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 981.  An arbitrary and capricious regulation of this sort is itself unlawful and receives no <i>Chevron </i>deference.  See <i>Mead Corp.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 227.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying those principles here, the unavoidable conclusion is that the 2011 regulation was issued without the reasoned explanation that was required in light of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s change in position and the significant reliance interests involved.  In promulgating the 2011 regulation, the Department offered barely any explanation.  A summary discussion may suffice in other circumstances, but here\xe2\x80\x94in particular because of decades of industry reliance on the Department\xe2\x80\x99s prior policy\xe2\x80\x94the explanation fell short of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s duty to explain why it deemed it necessary to overrule its previous position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The retail automobile and truck dealership industry had relied since 1978 on the Department\xe2\x80\x99s position that service advisors are exempt from the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s overtime pay requirements.  See National Automobile Dealers Association, Comment Letter on Proposed Rule Updating Reg-ulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act(Sept. 26, 2008), online at https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=WHD-2008-0003-0038.  Dealerships and service advisors negotiated and structured their compensation plans against this background understanding.  Requiring dealerships to adapt to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s new position could necessitate systemic, significant changes to the dealerships\xe2\x80\x99 compensation arrangements.  See Brief for National Automobile Dealers Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Dealerships whose service advisors are not compensated in accordance with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s new views could also face substantial FLSA liability, see\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7216(b), even if this risk of liability may be diminished in some cases by the existence of a separate FLSA exemption for certain employees paid on a commission basis, see \xc2\xa7207(i), and even if a dealership could defend against retroactive liability by showing it relied in good faith on the prior agency position, see \xc2\xa7259(a).  In light of this background, the Department needed a more reasoned explanation for its decision to depart from its existing enforcement policy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Department said that, in reaching its decision, it had \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully considered all of the comments, analyses, and arguments made for and against the proposed changes.\xe2\x80\x9d  76 Fed. Reg. 18832.  And it noted that, since 1978, ithad treated service advisors as exempt in certain circumstances.  <i>Id.</i>, at 18838.  It also noted the comment from the National Automobile Dealers Association stating that the industry had relied on that interpretation.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But when it came to explaining the \xe2\x80\x9cgood reasons for the new policy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Fox Television Stations</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 515, the Department said almost nothing.  It stated only that it would not treat service advisors as exempt because \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute does not include such positions and the Department recognizes that there are circumstances under which the requirements for the exemption would not be met.\xe2\x80\x9d  76 Fed. Reg. 18838.<i> </i> It continued that it \xe2\x80\x9cbelieves that this interpretation is reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csets forth the appropriate approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Although an agency may justify its policy choice by explaining why that policy \xe2\x80\x9cis more consistent with statutory language\xe2\x80\x9d than alternative policies, <i>Long Island Care at Home</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Department did not analyze or explain why the statute should be interpreted to exempt dealership employees who sell vehicles but not dealership employees who sell services (that is,<i> </i>service advisors).  And though several public comments supported the Department\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute, the Department did not explain what (if anything) it found persuasive in those comments beyond the few statements above.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is not the role of the courts to speculate on reasons that might have supported an agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\xe2\x80\x99s action that the agency itself has not given.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>State Farm</i>, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 43 (citing <i>SEC </i>v. <i>Chenery Corp.</i>,\n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194,\n196 (1947)\n).  Whatever potential reasons the Department might have given, the agency in fact gave almost no reasons at all.  In light of the serious reliance interests at stake, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s conclusory statements do not suffice to explain its decision.  See<i> Fox Television Stations</i>, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 515\xe2\x80\x93516.  This lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that is inconsistent with the Department\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding earlier position results in a rule that cannot carry the force of law.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(A); <i>State Farm</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.

As the Court acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at 11, an affirmative defense in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) protects regulated parties against retroactive liability for actions taken in good-faith reliance on superseded agency guidance,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7259(a).

Thus, the cost of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s policy shift may be considerably less than the dealerships project.

The three nouns are connected by the disjunctive \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d as are the gerunds.  So unless context dictates otherwise, a salesman can <i>either </i>be engaged in selling <i>or </i>servicing automobiles.  Cf. <i>Reiter</i> v. <i>Sonotone Corp.</i>,\n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330,\n339 (1979)\n.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> Context does not dictate otherwise.  A salesman, namely, one who sells servicing solutions, can be \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  The FLSA does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cservicing,\xe2\x80\x9d but its ordinary meaning includes both \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe action of providing a service.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 Oxford English Dictionary 39; see also Random House 1304 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe providing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. activities required by the public, as maintenance, repair, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d).  A service advisor\xe2\x80\x99s selling of service solutions fits both definitions.  The service advisor is the customer\xe2\x80\x99s liaison for purposes of deciding what parts are necessary to maintain or repair a vehicle, and therefore is primarily engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cthe action of maintaining or repairing a motor vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe action of providing a service\xe2\x80\x9d for an automobile.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other features of the exemption confirm that a service advisor is a salesman primarily engaged in servicing automobiles.  Consider the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s application to a \xe2\x80\x9cpartsman.\xe2\x80\x9d Like a service advisor, a partsman neither sells vehicles nor repairs vehicles himself.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa7779.372(c)(2) (2015) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cpartsman\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany employee employed for the purpose of and primarily engaged in requisitioning, stocking, and dispensing parts\xe2\x80\x9d).  For the provision to exempt partsmen, then, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in . . . servicing\xe2\x80\x9d must cover some employees who do not themselves perform repair or maintenance.  So \xe2\x80\x9cservicing\xe2\x80\x9d refers not only to the physical act of repairing or maintaining a vehicle but also to acts integral to the servicing process more generally.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contrary contentions are unavailing.  They first invoke the distributive canon: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere a sentence contains several antecedents and several consequents,\xe2\x80\x9d the distributive canon instructs courts to \xe2\x80\x9cread [those several terms] distributively and apply the words to the subjects which, by context, they seem most properly to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A N. Singer &amp; S. Singer, Sutherland on Statu-tory Construction \xc2\xa747.26, on p. 448 (rev. 7th ed. 2014).  Respondents accordingly maintain that\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A) exempts <i>only</i> salesmen primarily engaged in selling automobiles.  Brief for Respondents 20\xe2\x80\x9326.  But the distributive canon is less helpful in cases such as this because the antecedents and consequents cannot be read-ily matched on a one-to-one basis.  Here, there are three nouns to be matched with only two gerunds, so the canon does not overcome the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  Perhaps respondents might have a better argument if the statute exempted \xe2\x80\x9csalesman or mechanics who primarily engage in selling or servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  In such a case, one might assume that Congress meant the nouns and gerunds to match on a one-to-one basis, and the distributive canon could be utilized to determine how the matching should occur.  But that is not the statute before us.  For the reasons explained, <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934, the plain meaning of the various terms in the exemption establish that the term \xe2\x80\x9csalesman\xe2\x80\x9d is not limited to only those who sell automobiles.  It also extends to those \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents also resist this natural reading of the exemption by invoking the made-up canon that courts must narrowly construe the FLSA exemptions.  Brief for Respondents 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  The Ninth Circuit agreed with respondents on this score.  780 F.\xc2\xa03d 1267, 1271\xe2\x80\x931272, n.\xc2\xa03 (2015).  The court should not do so again on remand.  We have declined to apply that canon on two recent occasions, one of which also required the Court to parse the meaning of an exemption in \xc2\xa7213.  <i>Christopher </i>v.<i> SmithKline Beecham Corp.</i>, 567 U.S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___, n. 21 (2012) (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, n. 21); see also <i>Sandifer </i>v.<i> United States Steel Corp.</i>, 571 U.S. ___, ___, n. 7 (2014) (slip op., at 11, n.\xc2\xa07).  There is no basis to infer that Congress means anything beyond what a statute plainly says simply because the legislation in question could be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cremedial.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Scalia, Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal Analysis, 40 Case W. Res. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 581, 581\xe2\x80\x93586 (1990).  Indeed, this canon appears to \xe2\x80\x9cres[t] on an elemental misunderstanding of the legislative process,\xe2\x80\x9d viz., \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress intend[s] statutes to extend as far as possible in service of a singular objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the FLSA exemption set out in \xc2\xa7213(b)(10)(A) covers the service advisors in this case.  Service advisors are \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily engaged in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. servicing automobiles,\xe2\x80\x9d given their integral role in selling and providing vehicle services.  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
