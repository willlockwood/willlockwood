And as to the necessary power referred to, with all <em>incidental and resulting powers,</em> I give it to and confer it upon my aforesaid attorney, <em>with free, frank, and general administration without limit,</em> in order that there be no clause or special expression which would destroy the effect of it, because I gave them full power to substitute another, to revoke the appointed one\'s authority, and to name again substitutes, all of whom I exonerate from costs."</p>\n<p>Under the power of substitution thus given to them, Zimmerman, Frazier &amp; Co. substituted in their place Mr. Wright the consul of the United States, and a merchant of standing at Rio, whose official influence, it was apparently supposed, might be more potential than their own private efforts.

He afterwards came to the United States and urged our government to demand indemnity for this as for other wrongs of a like kind.  He spent money, removed difficulties, advanced proof, and furnished information.  The result of his or of other efforts was that our government finally made a demand for indemnity, and obtained it in this case, as in many others, under a treaty subsequently made.

The bill set forth Wright\'s long and effective services, his large outlays, and insisted that, "by the general maritime law and law of the place where the contract was made," he was entitled to compensation, and "that such compensation should be retained and received by him <em>out of the fruits of his said labors, services and expenses,</em>" and it set forth further,</p>\n<p>"that as well by agreements as by reason of the premises, and by force of the maritime law and the principles of equity, and the law and established usage of the place of said contract, he had"</p>\n<p>"<em>a lien upon the fruits and proceeds of the claim, in whatever form of proceeding the same was realized, through or by reason of his labors, advances, or services performed, advanced and rendered.</em>"</p>\n<p>It did not appear that the owners of the vessel had, in form, ever ratified what Wright did; but the evidence apparently was that they were cognizant, to a greater or less degree, of what he was doing, though he himself was the promoter of what was done everywhere. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 68 U.

S. 21</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The determination of the case depends upon the solution of the question whether the complainant has shown himself entitled to an equitable lien upon the fund, to which the controversy relates.</p>\n<p>The instrument executed by Goodrich, the master of the <em>Caspian,</em> to Zimmerman, Frazier &amp; Co., we think it quite clear, contemplated only judicial proceedings, and the disposition of the vessel, after those proceedings were successful.  Zimmerman, Frazier &amp; Co., in substituting the complainant in their place, did not attempt to give, nor could they have given, any greater authority than they themselves were clothed with.  The acquiescence of the owners whose rights are here in question may be properly held to have ratified the acts of Goodrich in their behalf, but it cannot be held to enlarge the powers conferred by the instrument which he executed, beyond what is expressed, and the objects in the minds of the parties at the time of the transaction.</p>\n<p>The services of the complainant in bringing into activity the diplomatic agencies of the United States, and otherwise, at Rio, and subsequently in prosecuting the claim in this city, were outside of his original authority.  Nevertheless they were beneficial to the claimants, and the approval of the defendants may be fairly implied from their silence and inaction.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 68 U. S. 22</a></p><p> When the defendant, Ellison, interposed, the fruit was ripe and ready to fall into the hands of those entitled to receive it.  We regard the case as a proper one for compensation, and in an action at law the complainant could hardly fail to recover.</p>\n<p>But this is a suit in equity.  The rules of equity are as fixed as those of law, and this Court can no more depart from the former than the latter.  Unless the complainant has shown a right to relief in equity, however clear his rights at law, he can have no redress in this proceeding.  In such cases, the adverse party has a constitutional right to a trial by jury.  The objection is one, which though not raised by the pleadings nor suggested by counsel, this Court is bound to recognize and enforce. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The evidence in the case is wholly silent as to any agreement touching the compensation of the complainant.  It is nowhere intimated what he was to receive, or when or how he was to be paid.  No established usage is shown.  The matter seems to have been left to rest upon the principle of <em>quantum meruit,</em> and to be settled by the agreement of the parties when the business was brought to a close.  The doctrine of equitable assignments is a comprehensive one, but it is not broad enough to include this case.  It is indispensable to a lien thus created, that there should be a distinct appropriation of the fund by the debtor, and an agreement that the creditor should be paid out of it. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  This case is wholly wanting in these elements.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/60/271/case.html#278">Hipp v.
