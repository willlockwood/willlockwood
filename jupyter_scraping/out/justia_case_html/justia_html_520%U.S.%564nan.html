Argued October 9, 1996-Decided May 19, 1997</p><p>Petitioner, a Maine nonprofit corporation, operates a church camp for children, most of whom are not Maine residents. Petitioner is financed through camper tuition and other revenues. From 1989 to 1991, it paid over $20,000 per year in real estate and personal property taxes. A state statute provides a general exemption from those taxes for charitable institutions incorporated in Maine. With respect to institutions operated principally for the benefit of Maine nonresidents, however, a charity may only qualify for a more limited tax benefit, and then only if its weekly charge for services does not exceed $30 per person. Petitioner was ineligible for any exemption, because its campers were largely nonresidents and its weekly tuition was roughly $400 per camper. Mter respondent town of Harrison (Town) rejected its request for a refund of taxes already paid and a continuing exemption from future taxes, which was based principally on a claim that the tax exemption statute violated the Commerce Clause, petitioner filed suit and was awarded summary judgment by the Superior Court. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that petitioner had not met its burden of persuasion that the statute is unconstitutional.</p><p><i>Held: </i>An otherwise generally applicable state property tax violates the Commerce Clause if its exemption for property owned by charitable institutions excludes organizations operated principally for the benefit of nonresidents.

The camp is unquestionably engaged in commerce, not only as a purchaser, see, <i>e. g., Katzenbach </i>v. <i>McClung, 379 </i>U. S. 294, 300-301, but also as a provider of goods and services akin to a hotel, see, <i>e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/241/case.html">379 U.

The Town\'s further argument that the dormant Clause is inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue is also rejected. Even assuming, as the Town argues, that Congress could not impose a national real estate tax, States are not free to levy such taxes in a manner that discriminates against interstate commerce. <i>Pennsylvania </i>v. <i>West Virginia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U.

The statute discriminates on its face against interstate commerce: It expressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clientele and those that primarily serve an intrastate market, singling out camps that serve mostly in-staters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizing those camps that do a principally interstate business. Such laws are virtually <i>per se </i>invalid. <i>E. g., Fulton Corp. </i>v. <i>Faulkner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/516/325/case.html">516 U. S. 325</a>, 331.

Any categorical distinction on the basis of profit is therefore wholly illusory. Pp. 583-588.</p><p>(e) The Town\'s arguments that the exemption statute should be viewed as either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy of those charities that focus on local concerns, see, <i>e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. </i>v. <i>Healy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/186/case.html">512 U. S. 186</a>, 199, or alternatively as a governmental "purchase" of charitable services falling within the narrow exception to the dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as "market participants," see, <i>e. g., Hughes </i>v. <i>Alexandria Scrap Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html">426 U. S. 794</a>; <i>Reeves, Inc. </i>v. <i>Stake, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U. S. 429</a>, are unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions and subsidies serve similar ends, they differ in important and relevant respects that preclude approval of the statute at issue. See, <i>e. g., West Lynn, </i>512 U. S., at 269, 278 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As for the "market participant" argument, the Court has already rejected the Town\'s position in <i>New Energy Co. of Ind. </i>v. <i>Limbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/269/case.html">486 U.

Nevertheless, history, including the history of commercial conflict that preceded the Constitutional Convention as well as the uniform course of Commerce Clause jurisprudence animated and enlightened by that early history, has shown that even the smallest discrimination invites significant inroads on national solidarity.

Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996), provides a general exemption from real estate and personal property taxes for "benevolent and charitable institutions incorporated" in the State. With respect to institutions that are "in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine," however, a charity may only qualify for a more limited tax benefit, and then only if the weekly charge for services provided does not exceed $30 per person. \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A)(1).2 Because most of the campers come from out</p><p>2 The statute provides:</p><p>"The following property of institutions and organizations is exempt from taxation:</p><p>"1. Property of institutions and organizations.</p><p>"A. The real estate and personal property owned and occupied or used solely for their own purposes by benevolent and charitable institutions incorporated by this State, and none of these may be deprived of the right of exemption by reason of the source from which its funds are derived or by reason of limitation in the classes of persons for whose benefit such funds are applied.</p><p>"(1) Any such institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine is entitled to an exemption not to exceed $50,000 of current just value only when the total amount of any stipends or charges that it makes or takes during any tax year, as defined by section 502, for its services, benefits or advantages divided by the total number of persons receiving such services, benefits or advantages during the same tax year does not result in an average rate in excess of $30 per week when said weekly rate is computed by dividing the average yearly charge per person by the total number of weeks in a tax year during which such institution is in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine. No such institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine and makes charges that result in an average weekly rate per person, as computed under this subparagraph, in excess of $30 may be entitled to tax exemption. This subparagraph does not apply to institutions incorporated as nonprofit corporations for the sole purpose of conducting medical research.</p><p>"For the purposes of this paragraph, \'benevolent and charitable institutions\' include, but are not limited to, nonprofit nursing homes and nonprofit</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="569">569</a></p><p>of State, petitioner could not qualify for a complete exemption.3 And, since the weekly tuition was roughly $400, petitioner was ineligible for any charitable tax exemption at all.</p><p>In 1992 petitioner made a formal request to the Town for a refund of taxes paid from 1989 through 1991, and a continuing exemption from future property taxes, based principally on a claim that the tax exemption statute violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.4 The request was denied, and petitioner filed suit in the Superior Court against the Town and its tax assessors and collectors.5 After the</p><p>boarding homes and boarding care facilities licensed by the Department of Human Services pursuant to Title 22, chapter 1665 or its successor, nonprofit community mental health service facilities licensed by the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, and Substance Abuse Services, pursuant to Title 34-B, chapter 3 and nonprofit child care centers incorporated by this State as benevolent and charitable institutions.

The parties are in agreement, however, that because petitioner\'s camp is attended almost entirely by out-of-staters, it would not qualify for the exemption under any reading of the language. See Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. The courts below appear to have presumed the same, and we of course accept their interpretation of state law.</p><p>4 Petitioner also argued below that the Maine statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Federal Constitution. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court had already found the statute constitutional under an equal protection analysis in a prior decision, and adhered to its earlier view. See <i>Green Acre Baha\'i Institute </i>v. <i>Eliot, </i>159 Me. 395, 193 A. 2d 564 (1963); 655 A. 2d 876, 879-880 (1995). As for the privileges and immunities claim, the Supreme Judicial Court found petitioner\'s argument unavailing. <i>Id., </i>at 880. These claims are not before us.</p><p>5 The Superior Court referred to all of the original defendants as "Municipal Defendants" because the State of Maine intervened to defend the constitutionality of its statute. App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a. However, the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="570">570</a></p><p>parties agreed on the relevant facts, they filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Superior Court ruled for petitioner, explaining that under Maine\'s statute:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Denial of a tax exemption is explicitly and primarily triggered by engaging in a certain level of interstate commerce. This denial makes operation of the institutions serving non-residents more expensive. This increased cost results from an impermissible distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers. <i>See </i>Commonwealth Edison Co., 453 U. S., at 617-19 .... Maine\'s charitable tax exemption is denied, not because there is a difference between the activities of charitable institutions serving residents and non-residents, but because of the residency of the people whom the institutions serve." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a (footnote omitted).</p></blockquote><p>The Town, but not the State, appealed and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court reversed. 655 A. 2d 876 (1995). Noting that a Maine statute 6 characterized tax exemptions as "tax expenditures," it viewed the exemption for charitable institutions as the equivalent of a purchase of their services. <i>Id., </i>at 878. Because the exemption statute "treats all Maine charities alike"-given the fact that "all have the opportunity to qualify for an exemption by choosing to dispense the majority of their charity locally"-it "regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce." <i>Id., </i>at 879. In the absence of evidence that petitioner\'s camp <i>"competes </i>with other summer camps outside of or within Maine," or that the statute "impedes interstate travel" or that it "provides services that are necessary for interstate travel," the Court concluded that petitioner had</p><p>State did not appeal the adverse decision of the Superior Court and, therefore, is not a respondent in this Court.

Because each State was free to adopt measures fostering its own local interests without regard to possible prejudice to nonresidents, what Justice Johnson characterized as a "conflict of commercial regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States," ensued. See <i>Gibbons </i>v. <i>Ogden, </i>9 Wheat. 1, 224 (1824) (opinion concurring in judgment). In his view, this "was the immediate cause that led to the forming of a [constitutional] convention." <i>Ibid. </i>"If there was anyone object riding over every other in the adoption of the constitution, it was to keep the commercial intercourse among the States free from all invidious and partial restraints." <i>Id., </i>at 231.7</p><p>We have subsequently endorsed Justice Johnson\'s appraisal of the central importance of federal control over interstate and foreign commerce and, more narrowly, his conclusion that the Commerce Clause had not only granted Congress express authority to override restrictive and conflicting commercial regulations adopted by the States, but that it also had immediately effected a curtailment of state power.

The Town argues that our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence is wholly inapplicable to this case, because interstate commerce is not implicated here and Congress has no power to enact a tax on real estate. We first reject these arguments, and then explain why we think our prior cases make it clear that if profit-making enterprises were at issue, Maine could not tax petitioner more heavily than other camp operators simply because its campers come principally from other States. We next address the novel question whether a different rule should apply to a discriminatory tax exemption for charitable and benevolent institutions. Finally, we reject the Town\'s argument that the exemption should either be viewed as a permissible subsidy or as a purchase of services by the State acting as a "market participant."</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>We are unpersuaded by the Town\'s argument that the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable here, either because campers are not "articles of commerce" or, more generally, because the camp\'s "product is delivered and \'consumed\' entirely within Maine."

It markets those services, together with an opportunity to enjoy the natural beauty of an inland lake in Maine, to campers who are attracted to its facility from all parts of the Nation. The record reflects that petitioner "advertises for campers in [out-of-state] periodicals ... and sends its Executive Director annually on camper recruiting trips across the country." App. 49-50. Petitioner\'s efforts are quite successful; 95 percent of its campers come from out of State. The attendance of these campers necessarily generates the transportation of persons across state lines that has long been recognized as a form of "commerce." <i>Edwards </i>v. <i>California, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/314/160/case.html">314 U.

S. 241</a> (1964), we recognized that interstate commerce is substantially affected by the activities of a hotel that "solicits patronage from outside the State of Georgia through various national advertising media, including magazines of national circulation." <i>Id., </i>at 243. In that case, we held that commerce was substantially affected by private race discrimination that limited access to the hotel and thereby impeded interstate commerce in the form of travel. <i>Id., </i>at 244, 258; see <i>Lopez, </i>514 U.

As we stated in <i>Hughes </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U.

That case in turn rested upon our reasoning in <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a> (1978), in which we rejected a "two-tiered definition of commerce." <i>Id., </i>at 622. "Just as Congress ha[d] power to regulate the interstate movement of [the] wastes" at issue in that case, so too we held were States "not free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement." <i>Id., </i>at 622-623.

S. 941</a>, 953 (1982).</p><p>The Town\'s arguments that the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable to petitioner because the campers are not "articles of commerce," or more generally that interstate commerce is not at issue here, are therefore unpersuasive. The services that petitioner provides to its principally out-ofstate campers clearly have a substantial effect on commerce, as do state restrictions on making those services available to nonresidents. Cf. C &amp; <i>A Carbone, Inc. </i>v. <i>Clarkstown, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/383/case.html">511 U. S. 383</a>, 391 (1994).</p><p>The Town also argues that the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue. We disagree. A tax on real estate, like any other tax, may impermissibly burden interstate commerce. We may assume as the Town argues (though the question is not before us) that Congress could not impose a national real estate tax. It does not follow that the States may impose real estate taxes in a manner that discriminates against interstate commerce. A State\'s "power to lay and collect taxes, comprehensive and necessary as that power is, cannot be exerted in a way which</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="575">575</a></p><p>involves a discrimination against [interstate] commerce." <i>Pennsylvania </i>v. <i>West Virginia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U. S. 553</a>, 596 (1923).</p><p>To allow a State to avoid the strictures of the dormant Commerce Clause by the simple device of labeling its discriminatory tax a levy on real estate would destroy the barrier against protectionism that the Constitution provides. We noted in <i>West Lynn Creamery, Inc. </i>v. <i>Healy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/186/case.html">512 U. S. 186</a> (1994), that "[t]he paradigmatic ... law discriminating against interstate commerce is the protective [import] tariff or customs duty, which taxes goods imported from other States, but does not tax similar products produced in State." <i>Id., </i>at 193. Such tariffs are "so patently unconstitutional that our cases reveal not a single attempt by a State to enact one." <i>Ibid. </i>Yet, were the Town\'s theory adopted, a State could create just such a tariff with ease. The State would need only to pass a statute imposing a special real estate tax on property used to store, process, or sell imported goods. By gearing the increased tax to the value of the imported goods at issue, the State could create the functional equivalent of an import tariff. As this example demonstrates, to accept the Town\'s theory would have radical and unacceptable results.</p><p>We therefore turn to the question whether our prior cases preclude a State from imposing a higher tax on a camp that serves principally nonresidents than on one that limits its services primarily to residents.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>There is no question that were this statute targeted at profit-making entities, it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. "State laws discriminating against interstate commerce on their face are \'virtually <i>per se </i>invalid.\' " <i>Fulton Corp. </i>v. <i>Faulkner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/516/325/case.html">516 U. S. 325</a>, 331 (1996) (quoting <i>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. </i>v. <i>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/case.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 99 (1994)). It is not necessary to look beyond the text of this statute to determine that it</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="576">576</a></p><p>discriminates against interstate commerce. The Maine law expressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clientele and those that primarily serve an intrastate market, singling out camps that serve mostly instaters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizing those camps that do a principally interstate business. As a practical matter, the statute encourages affected entities to limit their out-of-state clientele, and penalizes the principally nonresident customers of businesses catering to a primarily interstate market.</p><p>If such a policy were implemented by a statutory prohibition against providing camp services to nonresidents, the statute would almost certainly be invalid. We have "consistently ... held that the Commerce Clause ... precludes a state from mandating that its residents be given a preferred right of access, over out-of-state consumers, to natural resources located within its borders or to the products derived therefrom." <i>New England Power Co. </i>v. <i>New Hampshire, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/331/case.html">455 U.

We ruled similarly in <i>Pennsylvania </i>v. <i>West Virginia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/553/case.html">262 U. S. 553</a> (1923), that a West Virginia statute limiting out-of-state users\' access to West Virginia gas to that not "required to meet the local needs for all purposes," <i>id., </i>at 594, violated the Commerce Clause. We found those cases directly analogous in <i>New England Power, </i>ruling invalid a state law that reserved for state citizens domestically generated hydroelectric power. In <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a> (1978), we struck down a New Jersey statute prohibiting certain categories of out-of-state waste from flowing into the State\'s landfills, noting that "a State may not accord its own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to natural resources located within its borders." <i>Id., </i>at 627. And, in <i>Hughes </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i>441 U. S., at 338, we ruled that a statute prohibiting the export of minnows for sale out of State violated the Commerce Clause. We held similarly in <i>Sporhase </i>v. <i>Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html">458 U.

In this way, the Maine statute is like a law that burdens out-of-state access to domestically generated hydroelectric power, <i>New England Power, </i>or to local landfills, <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, 437 </i>U. S. 617 (1978). In those cases, as in this case, the burden fell on out-of-state access both to a natural resource and to related services provided by state residents.1o</p><p>Avoiding this sort of "economic Balkanization," <i>Hughes </i>v.</p><p><i>Oklahoma, </i>441 U.

Given the substantial portion of the national economy now devoted to service industries, see Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1995, p. 779 (Table 1288) (noting service industries constituted approximately 20 percent of gross domestic product in 1992), this is a natural development in our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="578">578</a></p><p>tages on local merchants; it may include attempts to give local consumers an advantage over consumers in other States." 11 By encouraging economic isolationism, prohibitions on out-of-state access to in-state resources serve the very evil that the dormant Commerce Clause was designed to prevent.</p><p>Of course, this case does not involve a total prohibition.</p><p>Rather, the statute provides a strong incentive for affected entities not to do business with nonresidents if they are able to so avoid the discriminatory tax. In this way, the statute is similar to the North Carolina "intangibles tax" that we struck down in <i>Fulton Corp. </i>v. <i>Faulkner, </i>516 U. S., at 327. That case involved the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of a state "regime that taxe[d] stock [held by in-state shareholders] only to the degree that its issuing corporation participates in interstate commerce." <i>Id., </i>at 333. We held the statute facially discriminatory, in part because it tended "to discourage domestic corporations from plying their trades in interstate commerce." <i>Ibid. </i>Maine\'s statute has a like effect.</p><p>To the extent that affected Maine organizations are not deterred by the statute from doing a principally interstate business, it is clear that discriminatory burdens on interstate commerce imposed by regulation or taxation may also violate the Commerce Clause. We have held that special fees assessed on nonresidents directly by the State when they attempt to use local services impose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. See, <i>e. g., Chemical Waste Management, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hunt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/334/case.html">504 U.

S. 609</a> (1981). There, we held permissible under the Commerce Clause a generally applicable Montana severance tax on coal extracted from in-state mines. Appellants challenged the tax arguing, <i>inter alia, </i>that it discriminated against interstate commerce because 90 percent of the coal happened to be shipped to out-of-state users, and the tax burden was therefore borne principally by nonresidents. We rejected this claim, noting that "there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed and not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers." <i>Id., </i>at 619. We recognized that an approach to the dormant Commerce Clause requiring an assessment of the likely demand for a particular good by nonresidents and a State\'s ability to shift its tax burden out of State "would require complex factual inquiries about such issues as elasticity of demand for the product and alternative sources of supply," <i>id., </i>at 619, n. 8, and declined to adopt such a difficult to police test. Here, in contrast, the tax scheme functions by design and on its face to burden out-of-state users disproportionately. Our analysis in <i>Commonwealth Edison </i>is therefore inapplicable.</p><p><i>CTS Corp. </i>v. <i>Dynamics Corp. of America, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/69/case.html">481 U.

This distinction makes no analytic difference. As we noted in <i>West Lynn Creamery </i>discussing the general phenomenon of import tariffs: "For over 150 years, our cases have rightly concluded that the imposition of a differential burden on any part of the stream of commerce-from wholesaler to retailer to consumer-is invalid, because a burden placed at any point will result in a disadvantage to the out-of-state producer." 512 U. S., at 202 (citing cases). So too here, it matters little that it is the camp that is taxed rather than the campers. The record demonstrates that the economic incidence of the tax falls at least in part on the campers, the Town has not contested the point, and the courts below based their decision on this presumption. App. 49; 655 A. 2d, at 879; App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a, n. 2.14</p><p>With respect to those businesses-like petitioner\'s-that continue to engage in a primarily interstate trade, the Maine statute therefore functionally serves as an export tariff that targets out-of-state consumers by taxing the businesses that</p><p>criminatory state law deterring hostile tender offers violated the dormant Commerce Clause because most such offers "are launched by offerors outside Indiana." <i>Id., </i>at 88. We explained that "nothing <i>in the ... Act </i>imposes a greater burden on out-of-state offerors than it does on similarly situated Indiana offerors." <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).

This characterization is quite misleading. The statute expressly exempts from tax property used by such important nonprofit service industries as nursing homes and child care centers. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A)(1) (Supp. 1996). Nonprofit participation in these sectors is substantial. Nationally, nonprofit nursing homes had estimated revenues of $18 billion in 1994. U.

In <i>Maine Medical Center </i>v. <i>Lucci, </i>317 A. 2d 1 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court presumed that a "large hospital" employing 2,000 people qualified as a "benevolent and charitable institution" for purposes of the \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) exemption, and held that a newly constructed $3.3 million parking facility-which patients, visitors, and staff were charged a fee to use-was also exempt from the tax. Though the garage was being operated at an immediate loss, "projected estimates of income and expense indicated a possible recovery of the capital investment over a period of twenty years." <i>Id., </i>at 2. Nonprofit hospitals had national revenues of roughly $305 billion in 1994, considerably more than the $34 billion in revenues collected by hospitals operated on a for-profit basis. U. S. Bureau of the Census, Service Annual Survey: 1994 (1996) (Tables 7.1, 7.3).</p><p>Maine law further permits qualifying nonprofits to rent out their property on a commercial basis at market rates in order to support other activities, so long as that use of the property is only incidental to their own purposes. See <i>Maine Medical Center, </i>317 A. 2d, at 2 (citing with approval <i>Curtis </i>v. <i>Androscoggin Lodge, No. </i>24, <i>Independent Order of Odd Fellows, </i>99 Me. 356, 360, 59 A. 518, 520 (1904)); <i>State Young Men\'s Christian Assn. </i>v. <i>Winthrop, </i>295 A. 2d 440, 442 (Me. 1972). Although Maine\'s tax exemption statute was amended in 1953 to specify that the property need not be occupied by the charity to qualify for the exemption, but may also be "used solely" for its own purposes, see <i>ibid., </i>this extension did not alter the "well defined rul[e] of exemption" permitting "occasional or purely incidental" renting. <i>Green Acre Baha\'i Institute, </i>150 Me., at 354, 110 A. 2d, at 584; see also <i>Alpha Rho Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha, Inc. </i>v. <i>Waterville, </i>477 A. 2d 1131, 1141 (Me. 1984). But cf. <i>Nature Conservancy of the Pine Tree State, Inc. </i>v. <i>Bristol, </i>385 A. 2d 39,43 (Me. 1978) (holding that requirement that property be used "solely" for institution\'s own purposes prohibits tax exemption where grantor of property to charity maintains private rights of use). Maine\'s statute expressly contemplates that entities receiving the benefit of the tax exemption may well earn profits, though of course these must be plowed back into the enterprise or otherwise appropriately used.

Indeed, if we view the issue solely from the State\'s perspective, it is equally reasonable to use discriminatory tax exemptions as a means of encouraging the growth of local trade. But as our cases clearly hold, such exemptions are impermissible. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. </i>v. <i>Dias, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/263/case.html">468 U.

Protectionism, whether targeted at for-profit entities or serving, as here, to encourage nonprofits to keep their efforts close to home, is forbidden under the dormant Commerce Clause.19 If there is need for a special exception for nonprofits, Congress not only has the power to create it,20 but also is in a far better position than we to determine its dimensions.21</p><p align="center">\nVI</p><p>Rather than urging us to create a categorical exception for nonprofit entities, the Town argues that Maine\'s exemption statute should be viewed as an expenditure of government money designed to lessen its social service burden and to foster the societal benefits provided by charitable organizations. So characterized, the Town submits that its tax exemption scheme is either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy</p><p>19 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA\'S suggestion, nothing in our holding today "prevent[s] a State from giving a tax break to charities that benefit the State\'s inhabitants." <i>Post, </i>at 595.

Yet at the same time, he makes a great effort to characterize <i>this </i>statute as being so narrow that, whatever the appropriate generally applicable rule, the dormant Commerce Clause ought not to apply here. <i>Post, </i>at 598. As we have explained, the argument in favor of a <i>categorical </i>exemption for nonprofits is unpersuasive, and we disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA\'S characterization of this statute\'s effects. Accordingly, we reject his position on either of these theories.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="589">589</a></p><p>of only those charities that choose to focus their activities on local concerns, or alternatively a governmental "purchase" of charitable services falling within the narrow exception to the dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as "market participants," see, <i>e. g., Hughes </i>v. <i>Alexandria Scrap Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/794/case.html">426 U. S. 794</a> (1976); <i>Reeves, Inc. </i>v. <i>Stake, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U. S. 429</a> (1980). We find these arguments unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions and subsidies serve similar ends, they differ in important and relevant respects, and our cases have recognized these distinctions. As for the "market participant" argument, we have already rejected the Town\'s position in a prior case, and in any event respondents\' openended exemption for charitable and benevolent institutions is not analogous to the industry-specific state actions that we reviewed in <i>Alexandria Scrap </i>and <i>Reeves.</i></p><p>The Town argues that its discriminatory tax exemption is, in economic reality, no different from a discriminatory subsidy of those charities that cater principally to local needs. Noting our statement in <i>West Lynn Creamery </i>that "[a] pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business," 512 U. S., at 199, the Town submits that since a discriminatory subsidy may be permissible, a discriminatory exemption must be, too. We have "never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies," <i>id., </i>at 199, n. 15, and we need not address these questions today. Assuming, <i>arguendo, </i>that the Town is correct that a direct subsidy benefiting only those nonprofits serving principally Maine residents would be permissible, our cases do not sanction a tax exemption serving similar ends.22</p><p>22 As the Supreme Judicial Court made clear, 655 A. 2d, at 878, under Maine law an exemption is categorized as a "tax expenditure." Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, \xc2\xa7 196 (1990). The Town\'s effort to argue that this state statutory categorization allows it to elide the federal constitutional distinction between tax exemptions and subsidies is unavailing.

We recognized that the party challenging the Ohio scheme was "eligible to receive a cash subsidy"</p><p>spending. See <i>Regan </i>v. <i>Taxation with Representation of Wash., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/case.html">461 U. S. 540</a>, 544 (1983).

See also <i>West Lynn, </i>512 U. S., at 210 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (drawing similar distinction between forbidden generally applicable tax with discriminatory "exemption" and permissible "subsidy ... funded from the State\'s general revenues"). This distinction is supported by scholarly commentary as well as precedent, and we see no reason to depart from it. See Enrich, Saving the States from Themselves: Commerce Clause Constraints on State Tax Incentives for Business, 110 Harv. L.

In this case, the petitioner is a Maine corporation, and the validity of the portion of the Maine statute that denies the exemption to out-of-state corporations is not at issue.

"That," we explained, "does not transform it into a form of state participation in the free market." <i>Ibid. </i>"The Ohio action ultimately at issue is neither its purchase nor its sale of ethanol, but its assessment and computation of taxes-a primeval governmental activity." <i>Ibid. </i>As we indicated in <i>White: </i>"[I]n this kind of case there is \'a single inquiry: whether the challenged "program constituted direct state participation in the market." ", 460 U. S., at 208 (quoting <i>Reeves, </i>447 U. S., at 436, n. 7). A tax exemption is not the sort of direct state involvement in the market that falls within the marketparticipation doctrine.</p><p>Even if we were prepared to expand the exception in the manner suggested by the Town, the Maine tax statute at issue here would be a poor candidate. Like the tax exemption upheld in <i>Walz-which </i>applied to libraries, art galleries, and hospitals as well as churches 28-the exemption that has been denied to petitioner is available to a broad category of charitable and benevolent institutions.29 For that reason, nothing short of a dramatic expansion of the "market-</p><p>28 See <i>Walz, </i>397 U.

Similarly, South Dakota\'s participation in the market for cement was-in part because of its narrow scope-readily conceived as a proprietary action of the State. In contrast, Maine\'s tax exemption-which sweeps to cover broad swathes of the nonprofit sector-must be viewed as action taken in the State\'s sovereign capacity rather than a proprietary decision to make an entry into all of the markets in which the exempted charities function. See <i>White, 460 </i>U. S., at 211, n. 7 (noting that "there are some limits on a state or local government\'s ability to impose restrictions that reach beyond the immediate parties with which the government transacts business"). The Town\'s version of the "market-participant" exception would swallow the rule against discriminatory tax schemes. Contrary to the Town\'s submission, the notion that whenever a State provides a discriminatory tax abatement it is "purchasing" some service in its proprietary capacity is not readily confined to the charitable context. A special tax concession for liquors indigenous to Hawaii, for example, might be conceived as a "purchase" of the jobs produced by local industry, or an investment in the unique local cultural value provided by these beverages. Cf. <i>Bacchus, </i>468 U. S., at 270-271. Discriminatory schemes favoring local farmers might be seen as the "purchase" of agricultural services in order to ensure that the State\'s citizens will have a steady local supply of the product. Cf. <i>West Lynn, </i>512 U. S., at 190 (striking down statute protecting in-state milk producers designed to "preserve ... local industry," "thereby ensur[ing] a continuous and adequate supply of fresh milk for our market" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Nevertheless, history, including the history of commercial conflict that preceded the Constitutional Convention as well as the uniform course of Commerce Clause jurisprudence animated and enlightened by that early history, provides the context in which each individual controversy must be judged. The history of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence has shown that even the smallest scale discrimination can interfere with the project of our Federal Union. As Justice Cardozo recognized, to countenance discrimination of the sort that Maine\'s statute represents would invite significant inroads on our "national solidarity":</p><blockquote><p>\n"The Constitution was framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less parochial in range.

As Justice Jackson once observed, the "vision of the Founders" was "that every farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free access to every market in the Nation, that no home embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign state will by customs duties or regulations exclude them." <i>H.

In our zeal to advance this policy, however, we must take care not to overstep our mandate, for the Commerce Clause was not intended "to cut the States off from legislating on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens, though the legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of the country." <i>Huron Portland Cement Co.</i></p><p>Our cases have struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States\' police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation.

The rules that we currently use can be simply stated, if not simply applied:</p><p>Where a state law facially discriminates against interstate commerce, we observe what has sometimes been referred to as a "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity;" where, on the other hand, a state law is nondiscriminatory, but nonetheless adversely affects interstate commerce, we employ a deferential "balancing test," under which the law will be sustained unless "the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits," <i>Pike </i>v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html">397 U.

Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/case.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 99 (1994).</p><p>While the "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity" entails application of the "strictest scrutiny," <i>Hughes </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a>, 337 (1979), it does not necessarily result in the invalidation of facially discriminatory state legislation, see, <i>e. g., Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a> (1986) (upholding absolute ban on the importation of baitfish into Maine), for "what may appear to be a \'discriminatory\' provision in the constitutionally prohibited sense-that is, a protectionist enactment-may on closer analysis not be so," <i>New Energy Co. of Ind. </i>v. <i>Limbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/269/case.html">486 U. S. 269</a>, 278 (1988). Thus, even a statute that erects an absolute barrier to the movement of goods across state lines will be upheld if "the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism," <i>id., </i>at 274, or to put a finer point on it, if the state law "advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives," <i>id., </i>at 278.</p><p>In addition to laws that employ suspect means as a necessary expedient to the advancement of legitimate state ends, we have also preserved from judicial invalidation laws that confer advantages upon the State\'s residents but do so without <i>regulating </i>interstate commerce. We have therefore excepted the State from scrutiny when it participates in markets rather than regulates them-by selling cement, for example, see <i>Reeves, Inc. </i>v. <i>Stake, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/429/case.html">447 U.

Likewise, we have said that direct subsidies to domestic industry do not run afoul of the Commerce Clause. See <i>New Energy Co., supra, </i>at 278. In sum, we have declared that "[t]he Commerce Clause does not prohibit all state action designed to give its residents an advantage in the marketplace, but only action of that description <i>in con-</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="598">598</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>nection with the State\'s regulation of interstate commerce." Ibid. (emphasis in original).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>In applying the foregoing principles to the case before us, it is of course important to understand the precise scope of the exemption created by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996-1997). The Court\'s analysis suffers from the misapprehension that \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) "sweeps to cover broad swathes of the nonprofit sector," <i>ante, </i>at 594, including nonprofit corporations engaged in quintessentially commercial activities. That is not so. A review of Maine law demonstrates that the provision at issue here is a narrow tax exemption, designed merely to compensate or subsidize those organizations that contribute to the public fisc by dispensing public benefits the State might otherwise provide.</p><p>Although Maine allows nonprofit corporations to be organized "for any lawful purpose," Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13-B, \xc2\xa7201 (1981 and Supp. 1996-1997), the exemption supplied by \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) does not extend to all nonprofit organizations, but only to those "benevolent and charitable institutions," \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A), which are "organized and conducted <i>exclusively </i>for benevolent and charitable purposes," \xc2\xa7 652(1)(C)(1) (emphasis added), and only to those parcels of real property and items of personal property that are used "solely," \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A), "to further the organization\'s charitable purposes," <i>Poland </i>v. <i>Poland Springs Health Institute, Inc., </i>649 A. 2d 1098, 1100 (Me. 1994). The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has defined the statutory term "benevolent and charitable institutions" to include only those nonprofits that dispense "charity," which is in turn defined to include only those acts which are</p><blockquote><p>\n"\'for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their minds or hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="599">599</a></p><blockquote><p>\nto establish themselves in life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works <i>or otherwise lessening the burdens of government.\'" Lewiston </i>v. <i>Marcotte Congregate Housing, Inc., </i>673 A. 2d 209, 211 (1996) (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has further limited the \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) exemption by insisting that the party claiming its benefit "bring its claim unmistakably within the spirit and intent of the act creating the exemption," <i>ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted), and by proclaiming that the spirit and intent of \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) is to compensate charitable organizations for their contribution to the public fisc. As the court has explained:</p><blockquote><p>\n"\'[A]ny institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of [its] burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a <i>"quid pro quo" </i>for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide.\'" <i>Episcopal Camp Foundation, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hope, </i>666 A. 2d 108, 110 (1995) (quoting <i>Young Men\'s Christian Assn. of Germantown </i>v. <i>Philadelphia, 323 </i>Pa. 401, 413, 187 A. 204, 210 (1936)).</p></blockquote><p>Thus, \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) exemptions have been denied to organizations that do not provide substantial public benefits, as defined by reference to the state public policy. In one case, for example, an organization devoted to maintaining a wildlife sanctuary was denied exemption on the ground that the preserve\'s prohibition on deer hunting conflicted with state policy on game management, so that the preserve could not be deemed to provide a public benefit. See <i>Holbrook Island Sanctuary </i>v. <i>Brooksville, </i>214 A. 2d 660 (Me. 1965). Even churches have been denied exemptions, see <i>Pentecostal Assembly of Bangor </i>v. <i>Maidlow, </i>414 A. 2d 891, 893-894</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="600">600</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>(Me. 1980) ("religious purposes are not to be equated with benevolent and charitable purposes").</p><p>The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has adhered rigorously to the requirement that the exempt property be used "solely" for charitable purposes. Even when there is no question that the organization owning the property is devoted exclusively to charitable purposes, the entire exemption will be forfeited if even a small fraction of the property is not used in furtherance of those purposes. See <i>Lewiston, supra, </i>at 212-213 (denying exemption to a building 18 percent of which was leased at market rates); <i>Nature Conservancy of Pine Tree State, Inc. </i>v. <i>Bristol, </i>385 A. 2d 39, 43 (1978) (denying exemption to a nature preserve on which the grantors had reserved rights-of-way).</p><p>That \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) serves to compensate private charities for helping to relieve the State of its burden of caring for its residents should not be obscured by the fact that this particular case involves a summer camp rather than a more traditional form of social service. The statute that the Court strikes down does not speak of "camps" at all, but rather lists as examples of "benevolent and charitable institutions" nonprofit nursing homes, boarding homes, community mental health service facilities, and child care centers, see \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A). <i>Some </i>summer camps fall within the exemption under a 1933 decision of the Supreme Judicial Court which applied it to a <i>tuitionjree </i>camp for <i>indigent </i>children, see <i>Camp Emoh Associates </i>v. <i>Inhabitants of Lyman, </i>166 A. 59, 60, and under a recent 4-to-3 decision which relied heavily on the fact that the camp at issue provided "moral instruction" and training in "social living and civic responsibility," and was not only "nonprofit" but furnished its camping services <i>below cost, </i>see <i>Episcopal Camp Foundation, supra, </i>at 109, 111. What is at issue in this case is not whether a summer camp can properly be regarded as relieving the State of social costs, but rather whether, <i>assuming it can, </i>a distinction between charities serving mainly residents and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="601">601</a></p><p>charities operated principally for the benefit of nonresidents is constitutional.1</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>I turn next to the validity of this focused tax exemptionapplicable only to property used solely for charitable purposes by organizations devoted exclusively to charity-under the negative Commerce Clause principles discussed earlier. The Court readily concludes that, by limiting the class of eligible property to that which is used "principally for the benefit of persons who are Maine residents," the statute "facially discriminates" against interstate commerce. That seems to me not necessarily true. Disparate treatment constitutes discrimination only if the objects of the disparate treatment are, for the relevant purposes, similarly situated. See <i>General Motors Corp. </i>v. <i>Tracy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/519/278/case.html">519 U. S. 278</a>, 298-299</p><p>1 The Court protests that "there is no <i>\'de minimis\' </i>defense to a charge of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause," <i>ante, </i>at 581, n. 15-as though that were the point of our emphasizing in this Part II the narrowness of the challenged limitation. It is not. Rather, the point is (1) that Maine\'s limitation focuses upon a particular state interest that is deserving of exemption from negative Commerce Clause invalidation, and (2) that acknowledging the principle of such an exemption (as developed in Part III below) will not place the "national market" in any peril. What the Court should have gleaned from our discussion, it did not: It persists in misdescribing the exemption we defend as "a categorical exemption of nonprofit activities from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny." <i>Ante, </i>at 588, n. 21; see also <i>ante, </i>at 591-592, n. 27.</p><p>The Court also makes an attempt to contest on the merits the narrowness of the exemption, suggesting a massive effect upon interstate commerce by reciting the multi-billion-dollar annual revenues of nonprofit nursing homes, child care centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations. See <i>ante, </i>at 586-587, n. 18. But of course most of the services provided by those institutions are provided locally, to local beneficiaries. (In that regard the summer camp that is the subject of the present suit is most atypical.) The record does not show the number of nonprofit nursing homes, child care centers, hospitals, and HMO\'s in Maine that have been denied the charitable exemption because their property is not used "principally for the benefit of persons who are Maine residents"; but it would be a good bet that the number is zero.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="602">602</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>(1997). And for purposes of entitlement to a tax subsidy from the State, it is certainly reasonable to think that property gratuitously devoted to relieving the State of some of its welfare burden is not similarly situated to property used "principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of [the State]," \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A). As we have seen, the theory underlying the exemption is that it is a <i>quid pro </i>quo for uncompensated expenditures that lessen the State\'s burden of providing assistance to its residents.</p><p>The Court seeks to establish "facial discrimination" by showing that the effect of treating disparate property disparately is to produce higher costs for those users of the property who come from out of State. But that could be regarded as an <i>indirect </i>effect upon interstate commerce produced by a tax scheme that is <i>not </i>facially discriminatory, which means that the proper mode of analysis would be the more lenient "balancing" standard discussed above. We follow precisely this mode of analysis in <i>Tracy, </i>upholding an Ohio law that provides preferential tax treatment to domestic public utilities. Such entities, we conclude, are not "similarly situated" to other fuel distributors; their insulation from out-of-state competition does not violate the negative Commerce Clause because it "serves important interests in health and safety." 519 U. S., at 306. The Court in <i>Tracy </i>paints a compelling image of people shivering in their homes in the dead of winter without the assured service that competition-sheltered public utilities provide. See <i>id., </i>at 301-302,306. No less important, however, is the availability of many of the benefits provided by Maine\'s private charities and facilitated not by total insulation from competition but by favorable tax treatment: care for the sick and dying, for example, or nursing services for the elderly.</p><p>Even if, however, the Maine statute displays "facial discrimination" against interstate commerce, that is not the end of the analysis. The most remarkable thing about today\'s judgment is that it is rendered without inquiry into whether the purposes of the tax exemption <i>justify </i>its favoritism.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="603">603</a></p><p>Once having concluded that the statute is facially discriminatory, the Court rests. "[T]he Town," it asserts, "has made no effort to defend the statute under the <i>per se </i>rule." <i>Ante, </i>at 582. This seems to me a pointless technicality. The town of Harrison (Town) has asserted that the State\'s interest in encouraging private entities to shoulder part of its socialwelfare burden validates this provision under the negative Commerce Clause. Whether it does so because the presence of that interest causes the resident-benefiting charities not to be "similarly situated" to the non-resident-benefiting charities, and hence <i>negates </i>"facial discrimination," or rather because the presence of that interest <i>justifies </i>"facial discrimination," is a question that is not only of no consequence but is also probably unanswerable. To strike down this statute because the Town\'s lawyers put the argument in one form rather than the other is truly senseless.2</p><p>If the Court were to proceed with that further analysis it would have to conclude, in my view, that this is one of those cases in which the "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity" does not apply. Facially discriminatory or not, the exemption is no more an artifice of economic protectionism than any state law which dispenses public assistance only to the State\'s residents.3 Our cases have always recognized the legitimacy of</p><p>2 I do not understand the Court\'s contention, <i>ante, </i>at 582, and n. 16, that <i>Fulton Corp. </i>v. <i>Faulkner, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/516/325/case.html">516 U. S. 325</a> (1996), provides precedent for such a course. In <i>Fulton, </i>the arguments left unaddressed had not been made in another form, but had not been made <i>at all. </i>There (unlike here) the State <i>conceded </i>facial discrimination, and relied exclusively on the compensatory tax defense, see <i>id., </i>at 333, which the Court found had not been made out, see <i>id., </i>at 344. That narrow defense could not possibly have been regarded as an invocation of broader policy justifications such as those asserted here.</p><p>3 In a footnote responding to this dissent, the Court does briefly address whether the statute fails the "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity." It concludes that it does fail because "Maine has ample alternatives short of a facially discriminatory property tax exemption," such as offering direct cash subsidies to parents of resident children or to camps that serve residents. <i>Ante, </i>at 582, n. 16. These are <i>nonregulatory </i>alternatives (and hence immune from negative Commerce Clause attack), but they are not</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="604">604</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>limiting state-provided welfare benefits to bona fide residents. As JUSTICE STEVENS once wrote for a unanimous Court: "Neither the overnight visitor, the unfriendly agent of a hostile power, the resident diplomat, nor the illegal entrant, can advance even a colorable claim to a share in the bounty that a conscientious sovereign makes available to its own citizens." <i>Mathews </i>v. <i>Diaz, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/67/case.html">426 U. S. 67</a>, 80 (1976). States have restricted public assistance to their own bona fide residents since colonial times, see, M. Ierley, With Charity For All, Welfare and Society, Ancient Times to the Present 41 (1984), and such self-interested behavior (or, put more benignly, application of the principle that charity begins at home) is inherent in the very structure of our federal system, cf. <i>Edgar </i>v. <i>MITE Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/624/case.html">457 U. S. 624</a>, 644 (1982) ("[T]he State has no legitimate interest in protecting nonresident[s]"). We have therefore upheld against equal protection challenge continuing residency requirements for municipal employment, see <i>McCarthy </i>v. <i>Philadelphia Civil Servo Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/645/case.html">424 U. S. 645</a> (1976) <i>(per curiam), </i>and bona fide</p><p><i>nondiscriminatory </i>alternatives, which is what the exception to the "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity" requires. See <i>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. </i>V. <i>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/93/case.html">511 U. S. 93</a>, 101 (1994) (quoting <i>New Energy Co. of Ind. </i>V. <i>Limbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/269/case.html">486 U. S. 269</a>, 278 (1988)). Surely, for example, our decision in <i>Maine </i>V. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a> (1986), which upheld Maine\'s regulatory ban on the importation of baitfish, would not have come out the other way if it had been shown that a state <i>subsidy </i>of sales of in-state baitfish could have achieved the same goal-by making the out-of-state fish noncompetitive and thereby excluding them from the market even more effectively than a difficult-to-police ban on importation. Where regulatory discrimination against out-of-state interests is appropriate, the negative Commerce Clause is not designed to push a State into nonregulatory discrimination instead. It permits state regulatory action disfavoring out-of-staters where disfavoring them is indispensable to the achievement of an important and nonprotectionist state objective. As applied to the present case: It is obviously impossible for a State to distribute social welfare benefits only to its residents without discriminating against nonresidents.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="605">605</a></p><p>residency requirements for free primary and secondary schooling, see <i>Martinez </i>v. <i>Bynum, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/321/case.html">461 U. S. 321</a> (1983).</p><p>If the negative Commerce Clause requires the invalidation of a law such as \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A), as a logical matter it also requires invalidation of the laws involved in those cases. After all, the Court today relies not on any discrimination against out-of-state nonprofits, but on the supposed discrimination against nonresident would-be <i>recipients </i>of charity (the nonprofits\' "customers"); surely those individuals are similarly discriminated against in the direct distribution of state benefits. The problem, of course, is not limited to municipal employment and free public schooling, but extends also to libraries, orphanages, homeless shelters, and refuges for battered women. One could hardly explain the constitutionality of a State\'s limiting its provision of these to its own residents on the theory that the State is a "market participant." These are traditional governmental functions, far removed from commercial activity and utterly unconnected to any genuine private market.</p><p>If, however, a State that provides social services directly <i>may </i>limit its largesse to its own residents, I see no reason why a State that chooses to provide some of its social services indirectly-by compensating or subsidizing private charitable providers-cannot be similarly restrictive.4 In fact, we have already approved it. In <i>Board of Ed. of Ky. Annual Conference of Methodist Episcopal Church </i>v. <i>Illinois, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/203/553/case.html">203 U.

That is quite impossible, inasmuch as we have <i>held </i>that out-of-state incorporation is <i>not </i>a constitutional basis for discriminating between charities. And in the case that announced that holding (invalidating the denial of a property tax exemption to a nonprofit corporation incorporated in another State), we distinguished <i>Board of Ed. of Ky. </i>on the ground that the statute at issue there withheld the exemption "by reason of the foreign corporation\'s failure or inability to benefit the State in the same measure as do domestic nonprofit corporations." <i>WHYY, Inc. </i>v. <i>Glassboro, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/117/case.html">393 U.

S. 131</a> (1986), there would remain the question whether we should not recognize an additional exception to the negative Commerce Clause, as we have in <i>Tracy. </i>As that case explains, just as a public health justification unrelated to economic protectionism may justify an overt discrimination against goods moving in interstate commerce, "so may health and safety considerations be weighed in the process of deciding the threshold question whether the conditions entailing application of the dormant Commerce Clause are present." 519 U. S., at 307. Today\'s opinion goes to great length to reject the Town\'s contention that Maine\'s property tax exemption does not fall squarely within either the "market participant" or "subsidy" exceptions to the negative Commerce Clause, but never stops to ask whether those exceptions are the only ones that may apply. As we explicitly acknowledge in <i>Tracy-which </i>effectively creates what might be called a "public utilities" exception to the negative Commerce Clause-the "subsidy" and "market participant" exceptions do not exhaust the realm of state actions that we should abstain from scrutinizing under the Commerce Clause. In my view, the provision by a State of free public schooling, public assistance, and other forms of social welfare to only (or principally) its own residents-whether it be accomplished directly or by providing tax exemptions, cash, or other property to private organizations that perform the work for the State-implicates none of the concerns underlying our</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="608">608</a></p><p align="center">\nSCALIA, J., dissenting</p><p>negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. That is, I think, self-evidently true, despite the Court\'s effort to label the recipients of the State\'s philanthropy as "customers," or "clientele," see, <i>e. g., ante, </i>at 576. Because \xc2\xa7 652(1)(A) clearly serves these purposes and has nothing to do with economic protectionism, I believe that it is beyond scrutiny under the negative Commerce Clause.</p><p>***</p><p>As I have discussed, there are various routes by which the Court could validate the statute at issue here: on the ground that it does not constitute "facial discrimination" against interstate commerce and readily survives the <i>Pike </i>v. <i>Bruce Church </i>balancing test; on the ground that it does constitute "facial discrimination" but is supported by such traditional and important state interests that it survives scrutiny under the "virtually <i>per se </i>rule of invalidity"; or on the ground that there is a "domestic charity" exception (just as there is a "public utility" exception) to the negative Commerce Clause. Whichever route is selected, it seems to me that the <i>quid pro quo </i>exemption at issue here is such a reasonable exercise of the State\'s taxing power that it is not prohibited by the Commerce Clause in the absence of congressional action. We held as much in <i>Board of Ed. of Ky. </i>and should not overrule that decision.</p><p>The State of Maine may have special need for a charitable-exemption limitation of the sort at issue here: Its lands and lakes are attractive to various charities of more densely populated Eastern States, which would (if the limitation did not exist) compel the taxpayers of Maine to subsidize their generosity. But the principle involved in our disapproval of Maine\'s exemption limitation has broad application elsewhere. A State will be unable, for example, to exempt private schools that serve its citizens from state and local real estate taxes unless it exempts as well private schools attended predominantly or entirely by students from</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="609">609</a></p><p>out of State. A State that provides a tax exemption for real property used exclusively for the purpose of feeding the poor must provide an exemption for the facilities of an organization devoted exclusively to feeding the poor in another country. These results may well be in accord with the parable of the Good Samaritan, but they have nothing to do with the Commerce Clause.</p><p>I respectfully dissent.</p><p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, and with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins as to Part I, dissenting.</p><p>The tax at issue here is a tax on real estate, the quintessential asset that does not move in interstate commerce. Maine exempts from its otherwise generally applicable property tax, and thereby subsidizes, certain charitable organizations that provide the bulk of their charity to Maine\'s own residents. By invalidating Maine\'s tax assessment on the real property of charitable organizations primarily serving non-Maine residents, because of the tax\'s alleged <i>indirect </i>effect on interstate commerce, the majority has essentially created a "dormant" Necessary and Proper Clause to supplement the "dormant" Commerce Clause. This move works a significant, unwarranted, and, in my view, improvident expansion in our "dormant," or "negative," Commerce Clause jurisprudence.1 For that reason, I join JUSTICE SCALIA\'S dissenting opinion.</p><p>1 Although the terms "dormant" and "negative" have often been used interchangeably to describe our jurisprudence in this area, I believe "negative" is the more appropriate term. See <i>Oklahoma Tax Comm\'n </i>v. <i>Jefferson Lines, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/175/case.html">514 U. S. 175</a>, 200 (1995) (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he \'negative Commerce Clause\' ... is \'negative\' not only because it negates state regulation of commerce, but also because it does <i>not </i>appear in the Constitution"). There is, quite frankly, nothing "dormant" about our jurisprudence in this area. See Eule, Laying the Dormant Commerce Clause to Rest, 91 Yale L. J. 425, 425, n. 1 (1982).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="610">610</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>I write separately, however, because I believe that the improper expansion undertaken today is possible only because our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, developed primarily to invalidate discriminatory state taxation of interstate commerce, was already both overbroad and unnecessary. It was overbroad because, unmoored from any constitutional text, it brought within the supervisory authority of the federal courts state action far afield from the discriminatory taxes it was primarily designed to check. It was unnecessary because the Constitution would seem to provide an <i>express </i>check on the States\' power to levy certain discriminatory taxes on the commerce of other States-not in the judicially created negative Commerce Clause, but in the Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, Import-Export Clause, our decision in <i>Woodruff </i>v. <i>Parham, </i>8 Wall. 123 (1869), notwithstanding. That the expansion effected by today\'s decision finds some support in the morass of our negative Commerce Clause case law only serves to highlight the need to abandon that failed jurisprudence and to consider restoring the original ImportExport Clause check on discriminatory state taxation to what appears to be its proper role. As I explain in Part III, the tax (and tax exemption) at issue in this case seems easily to survive Import-Export Clause scrutiny; I would therefore, in all likelihood, sustain Maine\'s tax under that Clause as well, were we to apply it instead of the judicially created negative Commerce Clause.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>The negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application.

There is nothing in the letter to suggest that Madison had in mind the "negative" Commerce Clause we have created which supposedly operates of its own force to allow <i>courts </i>to invalidate state laws that affect commerce. Rather, Madison\'s reference to the Clause as granting a "power" strongly suggests that he was merely asserting that the Convention designed the Clause more to enable "the General Government," namely, <i>Congress, </i>to <i>negate </i>state laws impeding commerce "rather than as a power to be used for the positive purposes of the General Government." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>8 See also <i>ante, </i>at 572 ("Congress unquestionably has the power to repudiate or substantially modify thEe] course of [our negative Commerce Clause] adjudication"); <i>Southern Pacific Co. </i>v. <i>Arizona ex rel.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp., <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U. S. 218</a> (1947) (same).</p><p>To be sure, we have overcome our reluctance to pre-empt state law in two types of situations: (1) where a state law directly conflicts with a federal law; and (2) where Congress, through extensive legislation, can be said to have pre-empted the field. See <i>Gade </i>v. <i>National Solid Wastes Management Assn., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/88/case.html">505 U. S. 88</a>, 98 (1992). But those two forms of preemption provide little aid to defenders of the negative Commerce Clause. Conflict pre-emption only applies when there is a direct clash between an Act of Congress and a state statute, but the very premise of the negative Commerce Clause is the <i>absence </i>of congressional action.</p><p>Field pre-emption likewise is of little use in areas where Congress has failed to enter the field, and certainly does not support the general proposition of "pre-emption-by-silence" that is used to provide a veneer of legitimacy to our negative Commerce Clause forays. Furthermore, field pre-emption</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="617">617</a></p><p>is itself suspect, at least as applied in the absence of a congressional command that a particular field be pre-empted. Perhaps recognizing this problem, our recent cases have frequently rejected field pre-emption in the absence of statutory language expressly requiring it. See, <i>e. g., O\'Melveny </i>&amp; <i>Myers </i>v. <i>FDIC, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/79/case.html">512 U. S. 79</a>, 85 (1994) ("Nor would we adopt a court-made rule to supplement federal statutory regulation that is comprehensive and detailed; matters left unaddressed in such a scheme are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law"). Even when an express pre-emption provision has been enacted by Congress, we have narrowly defined the area to be pre-empted. See, <i>e. g., Dillingham, supra, </i>at 324-325; <i>Cipollone </i>v. <i>Liggett Group, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/case.html">505 U. S. 504</a>, 517 (1992).</p><p>In the analogous context of statutory construction, we have similarly refused to rely on congressional <i>inaction </i>to alter the proper construction of a pre-existing statute. See <i>Central Bank of Denver, </i>N. <i>A. </i>v. <i>First Interstate Bank of Denver, </i>N. <i>A., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/case.html">511 U. S. 164</a>, 180-185 (1994). And, even more troubling, the "pre-emption-by-silence" rationale virtually amounts to legislation by default, in apparent violation of the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment. Cf. <i>INS </i>v. <i>Chadha, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 951-959 (1983). Thus, even were we wrongly to assume that congressional silence evidenced a desire to pre-empt some undefined category of state laws, and an intent to delegate such policyladen categorization to the courts, treating unenacted congressional intent as if it were law would be constitutionally dubious.</p><p>In sum, neither of the Court\'s proffered theoretical justifications-exclusivity or pre-emption-by-silence-currently supports our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, if either ever did. Despite the collapse of its theoretical foundation, I suspect we have nonetheless adhered to the negative Commerce Clause because we believed it necessary to check state measures contrary to the perceived <i>spirit, </i>if not</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="618">618</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>the actual letter, of the Constitution. Thus, in one of our early uses of the negative Commerce Clause, we invalidated a state tax on the privilege of selling goods "which are not the growth, produce, or manufacture of the State." <i>Welton </i>v. <i>Missouri, </i>91 U. S., at 278. And in <i>Cook </i>v. <i>Pennsylvania, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/566/case.html">97 U. S. 566</a> (1878), we struck down a state tax on out-ofstate goods sold at auction. See also, <i>e. g., </i>1. <i>M. Darnell </i><i>&amp; </i><i>Son Co. </i>v. <i>Memphis, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/113/case.html">208 U.

To this day, we find discriminatory state taxes on out-of-state goods to be "virtually <i>per se </i>invalid" under our negative Commerce Clause. See, <i>e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. </i>v. <i>Healy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/186/case.html">512 U. S. 186</a> (1994); <i>Associated Industries of Mo. </i>v. <i>Lohman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/511/641/case.html">511 U.

Though each of these cases reached what intuitively seemed to be a desirable result-and in some cases arguably was the constitutionally <i>correct </i>result, as I describe below-the negative Commerce Clause rationale upon which they rested remains unsettling because of that rationale\'s lack of a textual basis.</p><p>Moreover, our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has taken us well beyond the invalidation of obviously discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce. We have used the Clause to make policy-laden judgments that we are ill equipped and arguably unauthorized to make. See <i>Moorman Mfg. Co. </i>v. <i>Bair, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/case.html">437 U. S. 267</a>, 278-280 (1978) (recognizing that establishing a formula for apportioning taxes on multistate corporations would require "extensive judicial lawmaking" for which the courts are ill suited). In so doing, we have developed multifactor tests in order to assess the perceived "effect" any particular state tax or regulation has on interstate commerce. See <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </i>v. <i>Brady, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/274/case.html">430 U. S. 274</a> (1977); see also <i>Quill Corp. </i>v. <i>North</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="619">619</a></p><p><i>Dakota, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/298/case.html">504 U. S. 298</a> (1992). And in an unabashedly legislative manner, we have balanced that "effect" against the perceived interests of the taxing or regulating State, as the very description of our "general rule" indicates:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. <i>Huron [Portland] Cement Co. </i>v. <i>Detroit, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/440/case.html">362 U. S. 440</a>, 443 [(1960)]. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." <i>Pike </i>v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/137/case.html">397 U. S. 137</a>, 142 (1970).</p></blockquote><p>Any test that requires us to assess (1) whether a particular statute serves a "legitimate" local public interest; (2) whether the effects of the statute on interstate commerce are merely "incidental" or "clearly excessive in relation to the putative benefits"; (3) the "nature" of the local interest; and (4) whether there are alternative means of furthering the local interest that have a "lesser impact" on interstate commerce, and even then makes the question "one of degree," surely invites us, if not compels us, to function more as legislators than as judges. See <i>Bendix Autolite Corp. </i>v. <i>Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., </i>486 U. S., at 897-898 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (urging abandonment of the <i>Pike </i>balancing test so as to "leave essentially legislative judgments to the Congress").</p><p>Moreover, our open-ended balancing tests in this area have allowed us to reach different results based merely "on differing assessments of the force of competing analogies." <i>Okla-</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="620">620</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p><i>homa Tax Comm\'n </i>v. <i>Jefferson Lines, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/175/case.html">514 U.

The examples are almost too numerous to count, but there is perhaps none that more clearly makes the point than a comparison of our decisions in <i>Philadelphia </i>v. <i>New Jersey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/617/case.html">437 U. S. 617</a> (1978), and its progeny, on the one hand, and <i>Bowman </i>v. <i>Chicago </i>&amp; <i>Northwestern R. Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/465/case.html">125 U. S. 465</a> (1888), and its progeny, on the other. In <i>Bowman, </i>we recognized that States can prohibit the importation of "cattle or meat or other provisions that are diseased or decayed, or otherwise, from their condition and quality, unfit for human use or consumption," <i>id., </i>at 489, a view to which we have adhered for more than a century, see, <i>e. g., Maine </i>v. <i>Taylor, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/477/131/case.html">477 U. S. 131</a> (1986); <i>Asbell </i>v. <i>Kansas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/251/case.html">209 U. S. 251</a> (1908). In <i>Philadelphia, </i>however, we held that New Jersey could not prohibit the importation of "solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territoriallimits of the State." 437 U. S., at 618 (internal quotation marks omitted). The cases were arguably distinguishable, but only on policy grounds and not on any distinction derived from the text of the Constitution itself.</p><p>Similarly, we have in some cases rejected attempts by a State to limit use of the State\'s own natural resources to that State\'s residents. See, <i>e. g., Hughes </i>v. <i>Oklahoma, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/322/case.html">441 U. S. 322</a>, 338 (1979). But in other cases, we have upheld just such preferential access. See, <i>e. g., Sporhase </i>v. <i>Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/941/case.html">458 U. S. 941</a>, 955-957 (1982); cf. <i>Baldwin </i>v. <i>Fish and Game Comm\'n of Mont., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/371/case.html">436 U. S. 371</a> (1978). Again, the distinctions turned on often subtle policy judgments, not the text of the Constitution.</p><p>In my view, none of this policy-laden decisionmaking is proper. Rather, the Court should confine itself to interpreting the text of the Constitution, which itself seems to prohibit in plain terms certain of the more egregious state taxes on interstate commerce described above, see <i>supra, </i>at 618, and leaves to Congress the policy choices necessary for any further regulation of interstate commerce.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="621">621</a></p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Article I, \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides that "[n]o State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports .... " To the 20th-century reader, the Clause appears only to prohibit States from levying certain kinds of taxes on goods imported from or exported to <i>foreign </i>nations. But a strong argument can be made that for the Constitution\'s Framers and ratifiers-representatives of States which still viewed themselves as semi-independent sovereigns-the terms "imports" and "exports" encompassed not just trade with foreign nations, but trade with <i>other States </i>as well.</p><p>The late Professor William Crosskey, in a persuasive treatment of this subject nearly a half century ago, unearthed numerous founding-era examples in which the word "import" referred to goods produced in other States. See The True Meaning of the Imports and Exports Clause: Herein of "Interstate Trade Barriers," in 1787, 1 Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 295-323 (1953). Crosskey recounts, for example, that merchants frequently published advertisements in the local newspapers announcing recent shipments of such "imported" goods as "Philadelphia Flour," "Carolina Rice," and "Connecticut Beef." <i>Id., </i>at 298.10 Similarly, the word "export" was used to refer to</p><p>10 See also Gazette of the State of Georgia, Oct. 11, 1787, p. 3, col. 3 ("Just imported ...

Burlington [New Jersey] and Carolina, Pork, in Barrels"); <i>ibid. </i>("Just imported ... best Philadelphia Flour"); South Carolina Weekly Gazette, Sept. 13, 1783, p. 3, col. 2 ("Just imported, In the Sloop Rosana, ... from Rhode-Island, ... Potatoes, Apples, Onions by the bunch and bushel, Beats, Carrots, and good warranted Cheese"); Columbian Herald [Charleston, S. <i>C.], </i>Nov. 26,1787, p. 4, col. 4 ("Just imported, From Philadelphia, ...

One writer, for example, urged his fellow Connecticut citizens to manufacture stockings in sufficient quantity not only for the supply of Connecticut "but for <i>exportation to other States" </i>as well. Letter from "A. C.," Massachusetts Centinel, Sept. 5, 1787, p. 1, col. 1, reprinted from New Haven Gazette (emphasis added). Another argued that Connecticut could enrich itself "[b]y making and refining <i>Cyder </i>for <i>exportation </i>with which we might supply the <i>Southern States, </i>as well as the large provinces of Quebec and Nova-Scotia." Connecticut Farmer, New-Haven Gazette, Oct. 6, 1785, p. 2, col. 3 (second and third emphases added).</p><p>More significantly, the early statute books are replete with examples of these commonplace 18th-century understandings of the terms "import" and "export." The Virginia cheeseduty Act of October 1786, for example, provided for a duty of "three pence a pound on all cheese ... <i>imported </i>into this commonwealth." 12 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large, ch. 29, \xc2\xa7 2, p. 289 (emphasis added). As complaints published in New England newspapers indicate, that duty was imposed on cheese produced by the New England States. See Salem [Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787, p. 2, col. 2. Moreover, the duty was but one of many imposed by Virginia, which had for some time, it seems, "imposed like duties upon the importation of New-England rum, Lynn [Mass.] Shoes, Cheese, Cordage, and a variety of other articles manufactured in the Eastern States." Independent Chronicle [Boston], Apr. 19, 1787, p. 3, col. 2; see 11 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large, ch. 8, \xc2\xa78, pp. 121-122 (Oct. 1782) (imposing a tonnage duty "on all vessels ... from or to foreign parts, or from or to any of the United States," and an impost duty on goods "imported or brought into this commonwealth ... from any port or place whatsoever").</p><p>col. 4 (complaint about legislation pending in Georgia-later adoptedtaxing "all goods imported into the back part of that state from South Carolina").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="623">623</a></p><p>Maryland, for its part, taxed certain "articles exported out of" the State, including flour shipped to New England. 1784 Md. Laws, ch. 84, \xc2\xa7 1; see also Letter from "A Citizen," Norwich [Conn.] Packet, Jan. 17, 1788, p. 1, col. 1 ("The NewEngland States have imported, for four years past, from the State of Maryland, upwards of twenty five thousand barrels of flour annually-on which they have been obliged to pay a duty for the liberty of exportation"). And, when it provided for the inspection of salted foods "exported and imported from and to the town of Baltimore," Maryland expressly included salted foods "brought or imported into the said town, from any part of this state, or anyone of the United States, or from any foreign port whatever." 1786 Md. Laws, ch. 17, \xc2\xa75.</p><p>In similar fashion, Connecticut adopted an excise tax that distinguished between "imported Chocolate," taxed at three pence per pound, and "Chocolate made within this State," taxed at one penny per pound. 1783 Conn. Acts and Laws 619. And in May 1784, Connecticut adopted an import duty that expressly applied to certain enumerated articles "imported or brought into this State, by Land or Water, from any of the United States of America." 1784 Conn. Acts and Laws 271.11</p><p>11 Some commentators have argued that the phrase "imported or brought" suggests that Connecticut lawmakers intended to distinguish between foreign goods "imported" and other States\' goods "brought" into the State. This supposed distinction between "imported" and "brought" is not consistent with the remainder of the statute, however. For example, the second paragraph of the Act uses the phrase "brought or imported into this State" when referring exclusively to items "that are not the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of the United States." 1784 Conn. Acts and Laws 271. And conversely, "imported" is used alone in contexts where it plainly covers goods produced in other States. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>id., at 309 (setting duty for sugar, "whether the Produce or Manufacture of the United States, or not, imported into this State"); cf. 1786 Md. Laws, ch. 17, \xc2\xa7 6 (setting standards for "all beef and pork barrels brought to, or imported into, Baltimore-town, from any part of this state"). The more plausible view, therefore, is that the words "brought" and "imported" are</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="624">624</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>In fact, when state legislators of the founding generation intended to limit the term "imports" only to goods of foreign origin, they were quite adept at so indicating. See <i>id., </i>at 269 (provision regarding merchants "who shall import annually into [New London or New Haven] from Europe, Asia or Africa, Goods, Wares and Merchandise, the Growth, Produce or Manufacture of said Countries"); <i>id., </i>at 270 (setting duties for "Goods imported into this State from any Foreign Port, Island or Plantation not within any of The United States"); 2 New York Laws, ch. 7, p. 12 (1886) (Act of Nov. 18, 1784, setting duties for certain "articles imported from Europe"). Thus, based on this common 18th-century usage of the words "import" and "export," and the lack of any textual indication that the Clause was intended to apply exclusively to foreign goods, it seems likely that those who drafted the Constitution sought, through the Import-Export Clause, to prohibit States from levying duties and imposts on goods imported from, or exported to, other States as well as foreign nations, and that those who ratified the Constitution would have so understood the Clause.</p><p>Our Civil War era decision in <i>Woodruffv. Parham, </i>8 Wall. 123 (1869), of course, held that the Import-Export Clause applied only to foreign trade. None of the parties to these proceedings have challenged that holding, but given that the common 18th-century understanding of the words used in the Clause extended to interstate as well as foreign trade, it is</p><p>largely redundant and, to the extent they refer to different activities, the distinction in the phrase is not between foreign goods "imported" into Connecticut, on the one hand, and other States\' goods "brought" into Connecticut, on the other, but between goods of both kinds-domestic and foreign-commercially "imported" in quantity and those "brought" in limited quantities by individuals in their own baggage. Compare 1784 Conn. Acts and Laws, at 272 (using the phrase "imported or brought" when referring both to a ship\'s cargo and to the "Baggage of Passengers"), with <i>id., </i>at 273 (using only the word "imported" when referring solely to the ship\'s cargo).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="625">625</a></p><p>worth assessing the <i>Woodruff </i>Court\'s reasoning with an eye toward reconsidering that decision in an appropriate case.</p><p>The <i>Woodruff </i>Court began with a textual argument, contending that the power to levy "imposts" given to Congress in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 1, applied only to foreign imports. Such a limited reading of the word "imposts" in that Clause was necessary, the Court claimed, because any other reading would be nonsensical: Goods "imported" by one State from another State, explained the Court, would be an "export" of the State where the goods were produced or grown, and the supposed power given to Congress in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, to levy an "impost" on such "imports" would be prohibited by the Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, provision that "[n]o Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State." This apparent tension between \xc2\xa7 8 and \xc2\xa7 9 led the Court to believe that the word "imposts" in \xc2\xa7 8 must be read as applying only to foreign imports in order to avoid a partial negation of the Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, power. The Court then extrapolated from this reading that the word "impost" in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, similarly had the same limited application to foreign imports. As we have already seen, however, see <i>supra, </i>at 621-623, the word "import" derived its meaning from the jurisdiction into which goods were imported; consequently, it does not necessarily follow that the imports on which Congress was given the power to lay "imposts" in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, were identical to the imports and exports on which the several States were prohibited from levying "Imposts or Duties" by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10.12</p><p>The <i>Woodruff </i>Court bolstered its textual argument with two further arguments, neither of which appear still to be</p><p>12 Even assuming that the word "impost" in the two Clauses applied to the same class of "imports," there is nothing nonsensical in reading "impost" in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, as applicable to interstate as well as foreign trade. It is frequently the case that a broad grant of power in one Clause is restricted by another Clause. Moreover, a State could also import goods from a federal territory, and the congressional power to lay an impost on such (nonforeign) trade would not run afoul of the Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, prohibition.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="626">626</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>valid, if ever they were: First, that in the history of the Constitution\'s formation and adoption, "the words imports and imposts were used with <i>exclusive </i>reference to articles imported from foreign countries," <i>id., </i>at 133 (emphasis added), and second, the policy concern that goods imported from other States would be forever exempt from tax if the Clause were read to apply to interstate imports.</p><p>As to the first nontextual argument, the <i>Woodruff </i>Court was selective in its use of history, to say the least. It first asserted that, in Articles VI and IX of the Articles of Confederation, the words "imports, exports, and imposts are used with exclusive reference to foreign trade, because [those articles] have regard only to the treaty-making power of the federation." <i>Id., </i>at 134. Even if the <i>Woodruff </i>Court\'s assertion was accurate as to Articles VI and IX, which is doubtful,13 Article IV cannot be so read. That Article expressly permitted "duties" and "impositions" to be levied on property removed from one State to another, as long</p><p>13 Article VI, \xc2\xa7 3, merely provided that "[n]o State shall lay any imposts or duties, which may interfere with any stipulations in treaties, entered into by the United States in Congress assembled." 1 Stat. 5. And Article IX provided: "The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of ... entering into treaties and alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever .... " 1 Stat. 6. As should be evident, neither Article requires a reading of "impost" as applicable exclusively to foreign imports. The better reading is that when the States levied imposts in their individual capacities, they could not interfere with treaties enacted by the States in their collective capacity. In fact, the two provisions, read together, suggest the existence of much broader classes of "imposts," "imports," and "exports," and that only the <i>subclass </i>of imposts interfering with foreign trade might be prohibited. The absence of this very qualifier in the later enacted Import-Export Clause creates a negative inference that the unqualified constitutional language covered more than did the limited prohibition in the Articles of Confederation.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="627">627</a></p><p>as the property was not owned by "the United States, or either of them." 14</p><p>The <i>Woodruff </i>Court next turned to the use of the words "duty" and "import" in the Continental Congress.

See Salem [Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787. The general view of the Clause, however, and certainly the view of the several States that imposed duties on interstate trade, see <i>supra, </i>at 622-623, was that it applied only to goods actually owned by the States, not to goods grown or manufactured within them. See Salem [Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787 ("[T]he proper construction of that part of the Articles of Confederation is, that no state in the union shall lay a tax on pub lick property imported therein-for, be it remembered, Congress were, at the time the Confederation was formed, exporters of almost every necessary for carrying on the war, &amp; the clause alluded to was intended to prevent any individual state from laying a duty on those necessary supplies"); see also 12 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large, ch. 40, \xc2\xa7 3, pp. 304-305 (Oct. 1786) (distinguishing between articles "which are the property of the United States, or either of them," and articles "which shall be proved to be of the growth, produce or manufacture of the State from which they shall be imported").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="628">628</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>that foreign goods were the <i>exclusive </i>reference. Contrary to the <i>Woodruff </i>Court\'s claim, the historical record does not appear to support such an exclusive use of the words.</p><p>The records of the Continental Congress contain numerous examples of the words "duty," "impost," and "import" being used with reference to interstate trade. In 1785, for example, in response to the increasing animosities between the States engendered by conflicting interstate trade regulations, an amendment to the Articles of Confederation was proposed that would have vested in the Continental Congress the power to lay "such imposts and duties upon imports and exports, as may be necessary for the purpose" of "regulating the trade of the States, as well with foreign Nations, <i>as with each other." </i>28 Journals of the Continental Congress, Mar. 28, 1785, p. 201 (1933) (emphasis added). Two provisos within the proposed amendment further suggest that interstate imports and exports were very much within the purview of the amendment: First, "that the Citizens of the States shall in no instance be subjected to pay higher imposts and duties, than those imposed on the subjects of foreign powers"; and second, "that the Legislative power of the several States shall not be restrained from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>As early as 1779, the problems posed by <i>interstate </i>trade barriers had become acute enough to warrant a request by the Continental Congress urging the States "to repeal all laws or other restrictions laid on the inland trade between the said states." Resolution of Aug. 25, 1779, 14 Journals of the Continental Congress 986; <i>id., </i>at 996 (adopting resolution). While this particular resolution does not use the words "duties" or "imports," it seems evident from a survey of the statutory "duties" being levied by some States on goods "imported" from other States, see <i>supra, </i>at 622-623, that the resolution was directed at just such duties on imports from other States.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="629">629</a></p><p>Many of the States ignored the request, of course, and their "rival, conflicting and angry regulations" continued to be a source of conflict until the new Constitution went into effect. See Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787 (Draft), <i>circa </i>1836, in 3 Farrand 547; see also, <i>e. g., </i>William Ellery to Samuel Dick, Aug. 2, 1784, in 7 Letters of Members of the Continental Congress 579 (E. Burnett ed. 1934) (hereinafter Burnett\'s Letters) (predicting that Rhode Island would not agree to the national impost requested by the Congress in 1781 "until the States shall have agreed not to lay any <i>duties </i>upon goods <i>imported </i>into them from any one of their Sister States; perhaps not then" (emphasis added)); William Samuel Johnson to Jonathan Sturges (draft), Jan. 26,1785, in 8 Burnett\'s Letters 13 (noting that the Continental Congress was considering asking the States "to invest Congress with the Power of regulating their Trade as well with foreign Nations <i>as with each other," </i>a move which "might probably overturn the System [of "duties" on "imported" goods, see <i>supra, </i>at 623,] Conn[ecticu]t has adopt\'d as relat[iv]e to N. Y. which it is said she will counteract by regulat[ion]s of her Assembly now convening" (emphasis in original)).</p><p>In fact, the animosity engendered by the various duties levied on imports from other States was one of the motivating factors leading to the Annapolis Convention of 1786. See T. Powell, Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation 182 (1956) ("When the Framers spoke in 1787, the states were substantially sovereign, and their exercises of sovereign powers in adversely affecting trade from sister states was one of the factors leading to the Annapolis conference"). As noted by Tench Coxe, one of the Pennsylvania Commissioners appointed to attend the Convention: "Goods of the growth product and manufacture of the Other States in Union were [in several of the States] charged with high Duties upon importation into the enacting State-as great in many instances as those imposed on foreign Articles of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="630">630</a></p><p align="center">\nTHOMAS, J., dissenting</p><p>the same Kinds." Coxe, Letter to the Virginia Commissioners at Annapolis, Sept. 13, 1786, reprinted in 9 The Papers of James Madison 125 (Rutland ed. 1975). Coxe thought the very purpose of the Annapolis Convention had been "[t]o procure an alteration" of this and other practices, which were, he added, "evidently opposed to the great principles and Spirit of the Union." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Similarly, one of the first criticisms leveled against the Articles of Confederation during the ensuing Federal Convention was the general Government\'s inability to prevent "quarrels between states," including those arising from the various "duties" the States imposed upon each other, both on foreign goods moving through the seaport States and on each other\'s goods. See 1 Farrand 19,25 (Edmund Randolph, May 29); see also Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787 (draft), <i>circa </i>1836, in 3 Farrand 547-548 ("Some of the States, as Connecticut, taxed imports as from Massts higher than imports even from G. B. of w[hi]ch Massts. complained to Virga. and doubtless to other States").</p><p>While the focus of the Convention quickly moved beyond the mere abolition of trade barriers, of course, there are passages in the available Convention debates which indicate that interstate trade barriers remained a concern, and that the words of the Import-Export Clause applied to interstate, as well as to foreign, trade. George Mason, for example, proposed to exempt from the Import-Export Clause prohibition duties necessary for the States\' execution of their inspection laws. Otherwise, he argued, the "restriction on the States would prevent the incidental duties necessary for the inspection &amp; safe-keeping of their produce, and be ruinous to the [Southern] Staple States." 2 Farrand 588 (Sept. 12). James Madison seconded the motion, and his comment that any feared abuse of the power to levy duties on exports for inspection purposes was perhaps best guarded against by "the right in the Genl. Government to regulate trade <i>be</i>tween State &amp; <i>State," id., </i>at 588-589 (emphasis added),</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="631">631</a></p><p>strongly suggests that exports to other States were within the Clause\'s reach.15</p><p>These references to duties on <i>interstate </i>imports and exports are bolstered by several more in the ratification debates. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 57-58 (2d ed. 1891) (hereinafter Elliot) (Dawes, Massachusetts ratifying convention) ("As to commerce, it is well known that the different states now pursue different systems of duties in regard to each other. By this, and for want of general laws of prohibition through the Union, we have not secured even our own domestic traffic that passes from state to state" (original emphasis deleted)). Indeed, one of the principal Anti-Federalist complaints against the new Constitution was that States were prohibited from laying <i>any </i>duties or imposts on imports or exports, a prohibition that, in their view, left only direct taxation as a means for the States to support their own governments. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Brutus 1, Oct. 18, 1787, in 13 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 415 (J. Kaminsky &amp; G. Saladino eds. 1981) (hereinafter Doc. Hist.) ("No state can ... lay any duties, or imposts, on imports, or exports .... [T]he only mean therefore left, for any state to support its government and discharge its debts, is by direct taxation").16 This</p><p>15 Furthermore, in response to concerns that the inspection exemption might be used merely as a pretext for taxing neighboring States, see 2 Farrand 589, Mason\'s proposal was further amended to make any such State inspection laws "subject to the revision and controul of Congress," <i>id., </i>at 607, 624. The need for, and existence of, this further limitation on the States\' authority to tax imports and exports suggests that the Commerce Clause power itself, referred to by Madison, would not operate to limit the States of its own accord. See <i>supra, </i>at 613-614, n. 7.</p><p>16 See also John Quincy Adams to William Cranch, Oct. 14,1787, in 14 Doc.

Hamilton) ("([W]ith the sole exception of duties on imports and exports)[, States] would, under the plan of the convention, retain [the] authority [to raise their own revenues] in the most absolute and unqualified sense"). But it does suggest that the Anti-Federalists, at least, viewed the Import- Export Clause as prohibiting all other state taxes, including the duties then in place on goods imported from neighboring States. And moves in various States shortly after the Constitution\'s ratification to repeal the offending duties on interstate trade support the Anti-Federalist view.

This view of the Clause\'s prohibition would result in "the grossest injustice," said the Court, were the Clause to be read as applying to "articles brought from one State into another," for "[n]either the State nor the city which protects [the import merchant\'s] life and property [could] make him contribute a dollar to support its government." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>17 Farrand did not publish his volumes until 1911 (although the <i>Woodruff </i>Court did have available to it Madison\'s notes, as well as the more perfunctory convention journal); Burnett\'s Letters were published between 1921 and 1936; the Journals of the Continental Congress were published between 1904 and 1937; volume 9 of The Papers of James Madison, in which Tench Coxe\'s letter was first reprinted, was not published until 1975; and a useful, readily accessible collection of the various Anti-Federalist writings was not available until 1981. This is not to say that the original documents reprinted in these volumes would not have been available to the <i>Woodruff </i>Court.

The only remaining argument made by the <i>Woodruff </i>majority was that it was "improbable" that the Convention would have permitted States to tax "imports" from other States merely with the assent of Congress, because the revenues that would accrue to Congress by granting such assent would prove too great a temptation for Congress to serve as a neutral arbiter regarding such taxes. <i>Woodruff, supra, </i>at 133.

In <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Maryland, </i>12 Wheat. 419, 449 (1827), Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, suggested: "[W]e suppose the principles laid down in this case [namely, that a state license tax on importers of foreign articles was invalid both under the Import-Export Clause and the Act of Congress which authorizes importation] to apply equally to importations from a sister State." And just eight years before <i>Woodruff, </i>Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, struck down a stamp tax on bills of lading for gold being shipped from California to New York, holding that "the State tax in question is a duty upon the <i>export </i>of gold and silver, and consequently repugnant to the [ImportExport] clause in the Constitution." <i>Almy </i>v. <i>California, </i>24 How. 169, 175 (1861) (emphasis added).</p><p>Chief Justice Marshall\'s statement in <i>Brown </i>was merely dicta, of course, but the <i>Woodruffmajority\'s </i>rejection of the precedential force of <i>Almy, </i>based solely on its assertion that "[i]t seems to have escaped the attention of counsel on both sides, and of the Chief Justice who delivered the opinion,</p><p>18 Indeed, were I similarly to speculate, I would not find it "improbable" that the Convention would have trusted Congress to serve as a referee between individual States. Since many States would necessarily be harmed by a single State\'s impost, the institutional checks would in all likelihood be sufficient to counter any revenue "temptation" Congress might have faced, especially given the extensive revenue authority granted directly to Congress in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 1. My "speculation" is at least consistent with the recorded Convention debates. Roger Sherman proposed the requirement that any revenues raised by congressionally approved state imposts go into the federal treasury not as a separate means of raising national revenues, but to ensure that the States not use a protectionist impost as a pretext for raising revenues from other States.

The <i>Almy </i>Court expressly noted that Mr. Almy was charged with failing to pay the stamp tax on a bill of lading for "a quantity of gold-dust for transportation to New York" from San Francisco, 24 How., at 172, and the explicit "question presented by the case" was whether a State had a right "to tax such instruments when used in <i>commerce among the States," </i>Brief for Plaintiff in Error in <i>Almy </i>v. <i>California, </i>D.

Of course, much of what the ImportExport Clause appears to have been designed to protect against has since been addressed under the negative Commerce Clause. As the majority recognizes, discriminatory state taxation of interstate commerce is one of the core pieces of our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. <i>Ante, </i>at 581. Were it simply a matter of invalidating state laws under one Clause of the Constitution rather than another, I might be inclined to leave well enough alone. Indeed, our rule that state taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce are virtually <i>per se </i>invalid under the negative Commerce Clause may well approximate the apparent prohibition of the Import-Export Clause itself. But, as already described, without the proper textual roots, our negative Commerce Clause has gone far afield of its core-and we have yet to articulate either a coherent rationale for permitting the courts effectively to legislate in this field, or a workable test for assessing which state laws pass negative Commerce Clause muster. Precedent as unworkable as our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has become is simply not entitled to the weight of <i>stare decisis. </i>See <i>Holder</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="637">637</a></p><p>v. <i>Hall, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/512/874/case.html">512 U.

Unlike the Export Clause of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, which prohibits the Congress from levying <i>any </i>tax on exports, the Import- Export Clause only prohibits States from levying "duties" and "imposts."

Such taxes were classified as "direct" taxes at the time of the framing, and were not within the class of "indirect" taxes encompassed by the common understanding of the word "duties." The amount of the Maine tax is tied to the value of the real property on which it is imposed, not to any particular goods, and not even to the number of campers served. It does not appear, therefore, to be a "duty" on "imports" in any sense of the words.22 Even when coupled with the tax exemption for certain Maine charities (which is, in truth, no different than a subsidy paid out of the State\'s general revenues), Maine\'s property tax would not seem to be a "Duty or Impost on Imports or Exports" within the meaning of the Import-Export Clause. Thus, were we to overrule <i>Woodruff </i>and apply the Import-Export Clause to this case, I would in all likelihood sustain this tax under that Clause as well.</p><p>22 Even were I to agree with the majority that a particular property tax may be a property tax in name only, see <i>ante, </i>at 574-575, and even were I to assume that travel across state lines to consume services in another State renders those traveling consumers "imports," it is difficult to characterize the tax at issue here as a duty on imports. It is, rather, as the majority recognizes, a "generally applicable state property tax." <i>Ante, </i>at 567. Maine\'s grant of an exemption from the tax to some charitable organizations that dispense their charity primarily to Maine residents makes the tax something less than universal, but it does not make the tax, even in practical effect, one that is levied exclusively, or even primarily, on imports. See, <i>e. g., New Energy Co. of Ind. </i>v. <i>Limbach, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/269/case.html">486 U. S. 269</a> (1988); <i>Maryland </i>v. <i>Louisiana, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/case.html">451 U.

S. 803</a>,821 (1989) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (arguing, in an analogous context, that "the fact that a State may elect to grant a preference, or an exemption, to a small percentage of its residents does not make the tax discriminatory").</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
