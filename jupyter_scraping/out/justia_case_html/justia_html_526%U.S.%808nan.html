There we hold that police violate the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners when they allow members of the media to accompany them during the execution of a warrant in their home. We also hold there that because the law on this question before to day\'s decision was not clearly established, the police in that case were entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. <i>Ante, </i>at 605-606.</p><p>Petitioners maintain that even though they may have violated the Fourth Amendment rights of respondents, they are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. We agree. Our holding in <i>Wilson </i>makes clear that this right was not clearly established in 1992. The parties have not called our attention to any decisions which would have made the state of the law any clearer a year later-at the time of the search in this case. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p><p>As I explain in my dissent in <i>Wilson </i>v. <i>Layne, ante, </i>p. 618, I am convinced that the constitutional rule recognized in that case had been clearly established long before 1992. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court\'s disposition of this case on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
