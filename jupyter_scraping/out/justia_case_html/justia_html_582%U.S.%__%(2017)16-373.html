Petitioner, the largest public pension fund in the country, purchased some of those securities; and it is alleged that respondents, various financial firms, are liable under the Act for their participation as underwriters in the transactions.  In 2008, a putative class action was filed against respondents in the Southern District of New York.  The complaint raised \xc2\xa711 claims, alleging that the registration statements for certain of Lehman\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 and 2008 securities offerings included material misstatements or omissions.  Because the complaint was filed on behalf of all persons who purchased the identified securities, petitioner was a member of the putative class.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In February 2011, more than three years after the relevant securities offerings, petitioner filed a separate complaint against respondents in the Northern District of California, alleging violations identical to those in the class action on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own behalf.  Soon thereafter, a proposed settlement was reached in the putative class action, but petitioner opted out of the class.  Respondents then moved to dismiss petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual suit, alleging that the \xc2\xa711 violations were untimely under the 3-year bar in the second sentence of \xc2\xa713.  Petitioner countered that the 3-year period was tolled during the pendency of the class-action filing, relying on <i>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538\n.  The trial court disagreed, and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s tolling principle is inapplicable to the 3-year bar.

Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The two categories of statutory time bars\xe2\x80\x94statutes of limitations and statutes of repose\xe2\x80\x94each have \xe2\x80\x9ca distinct purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CTS Corp.</i> v. <i>Waldburger</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Statutes of limitations are designed to encourage plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at<i> ___</i>, while statutes of repose \xe2\x80\x9ceffect a legislative judgment that a defendant should \xe2\x80\x98be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id., </i>at ___.  For this reason, statutes of limitations begin to run \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the cause of action accrues,\xe2\x80\x9d while statutes of repose begin to run on \xe2\x80\x9cthe date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">From the structure of \xc2\xa713, and the language of its second sentence, it is evident that the 3-year bar is a statute of repose.  The instruction that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n no event\xe2\x80\x9d shall an action be brought more than three years after the relevant securities offering admits of no exception.  The statute also runs from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s last culpable act (the securities offering), not from the accrual of the claim (the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the defect).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This view is confirmed by \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s two-sentence structure.  The pairing of a shorter statute of limitations and a longer statute of repose is a common feature of statutory time limits.  See, <i>e.g., Gabelli</i> v. <i>SEC</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442\n.  Section 13\xe2\x80\x99s history also supports the classification.  The 1933 Securities Act\xe2\x80\x99s original 2-year discovery period and 10-year outside limit were shortened a year later.  The evident design of the shortened period was to protect defendants\xe2\x80\x99 financial security by reducing the open period for potential liability.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The determination that the 3-year period is a statute of repose is critical here, for the question whether a tolling rule applies to a given statutory time bar is one \xe2\x80\x9cof statutory intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lozano</i> v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___.  In light of the purpose of a statute of repose, the provision is in general not subject to tolling.  Tolling is permissible only where there is a particular indication that the legislature did not intend the statute to provide complete repose but instead anticipated the extension of the statutory period under certain circumstances.  A statute of repose implements a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislative decisio[n] that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. there should be a specific time beyond which a defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted liability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CTS</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___.  The unqualified nature of that determination supersedes the courts\xe2\x80\x99 residual authority and forecloses the extension of the statutory period based on equitable principles.  Thus, the Court repeatedly has stated that statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling.  See, <i>e.g., id., </i>at ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(3)\xc2\xa0The tolling decision in <i>American Pipe</i> derived from equity principles and therefore cannot alter the unconditional language and purpose of the 3-year statute of repose.  The source of the tolling rule applied in <i>American Pipe</i> is the judicial power to promote equity, not the power to interpret and enforce statutory provisions.  Nothing in the decision suggests that its tolling rule was mandated by a statute or federal rule.  Moreover, the Court relied on cases that are paradigm applications of equitable tolling principles, see 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 559.  Thus, the Court has previously referred to <i>American Pipe</i> as \xe2\x80\x9cequitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89\n, and n.\xc2\xa03.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(4)\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, petitioner contends that this case is indistinguishable from <i>American Pipe</i>, but the statute there was one of limitations, which may be tolled by equitable considerations even where a statute of repose may not.  Second, petitioner argues that the timely filing of a class-action complaint fulfills the purposes of a statutory time limit with regard to later filed suits by individual members of the class.  But by permitting a class action to splinter into individual suits, the application of <i>American Pipe</i> tolling here would threaten to alter and expand a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s accountability, contradicting the substance of a statute of repose.  Third, petitioner contends that dismissal of its individual suit as untimely would eviscerate its ability to opt out, but it does not follow from any privilege to opt out that an ensuing suit can be filed without regard to mandatory time limits.  Fourth, petitioner argues that declining to apply <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to statutes of repose will create inefficiencies, but this Court \xe2\x80\x9clack[s] the authority to rewrite\xe2\x80\x9d the statute of repose or to ignore its plain import.  <i>Baker Botts L. L. P.</i> v. <i>ASARCO LLC</i>, 576 U. S. ___, ___.  And petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s practical concerns likely are overstated.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Also unpersuasive is petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument: that \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d within three years of the relevant securities offering is met here because the filing of the class-action complaint \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d within the statutory time period.  This argument presumes that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d when substantive claims are presented to any court, rather than when a particular complaint is filed in a particular court.  The term \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d however, refers to a judicial \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d or perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9csuit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not to the general content of claims.  Taken to its logical limit, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument would make an individual action timely even if it were filed decades after the original securities offering\xe2\x80\x94provided a class-action complaint had been filed within the initial 3-year period.  Congress would not have intended this result.  This argument is also inconsistent with the reasoning in <i>American Pipe </i>itself.  If the filing of a class action made all subsequent actions by putative class members timely, there would be no need for tolling at all.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The final analysis is straightforward.  Because \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year time bar is a statute of repose, it displaces the traditional power of courts to modify statutory time limits in the name of equity.  And because the <i>American Pipe</i> tolling rule is rooted in those equitable powers, it cannot extend the 3-year period.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s untimely filing of its individual action is thus ground for dismissal.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">655 Fed.

In 2007 and 2008, Lehman raised capital through a number of public securities offerings.  Petitioner, California Public Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System (sometimes called CalPERS), is the largest public pension fund in the country.  Petitioner purchased securities in some of these Lehman offerings; and it is alleged that respondents, various financial firms, are liable under the Act for their participation as underwriters in the transactions.  The separate respondents are listed in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In September 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy.  Around the same time, a putative class action concerning Lehman securities was filed against respondents in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The operative complaint raised claims under \xc2\xa711, alleging that the registration statements for certain of Lehman\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 and 2008 securities offerings included material misstatements or omissions.  The complaint was filed on behalf of all persons who purchased the identified securities, making petitioner a member of the putative class.  Petitioner, however, was not one of the named plaintiffs in the suit.  The class action was consolidated with other securities suits against Lehman in a single multidistrict litigation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In February 2011, petitioner filed a separate complaint against respondents in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  This suit was filed more than three years after the relevant transactions occurred.  The complaint alleged identical securities law violations as the class-action complaint, but the claims were on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own behalf.  The suit was transferred and consolidated with the multidistrict litigation in the Southern District of New York.  Soon thereafter, a proposed settlement was reached in the putative class action.  Petitioner, apparently convinced it could obtain a more favorable recovery in its separate suit, opted out of the class.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents then moved to dismiss petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s indi-vidual suit alleging \xc2\xa711 violations as untimely under the 3-year bar in the second sentence of \xc2\xa713.  Petitioner countered that its individual suit was timely because that 3-year period was tolled during the pendency of the class-action filing.  The principal authority cited to support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the 3-year period was tolled was <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr.

In agreement with the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the tolling principle discussed in <i>American Pipe</i> is inapplicable to the 3-year time bar.  <i>In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA Litigation</i>,<i> </i>655 Fed. Appx. 13, 15 (2016).  As the Court of Appeals noted, there is disagreement about whether the tolling rule of <i>American Pipe</i> applies to the 3-year time bar in \xc2\xa713.

Both \xe2\x80\x9care mechanisms used to limit the temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9ceach has a distinct purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936). </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Statutes of limitations are designed to encourage plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cto pursue diligent prosecution of known claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).

From the structure of \xc2\xa713, and the language of its second sentence, it is evident that the 3-year bar is a statute of repose.  In fact, this Court has already described the provision as establishing \xe2\x80\x9ca period of repose,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impose[s] an outside limit\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on temporal liability.  <i>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow</i> v. <i>Gilbertson</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350,\n363 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute provides in clear terms that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n no event\xe2\x80\x9d shall an action be brought more than three years after the securities offering on which it is based.\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777m.

See <i>CTS</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937); cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Brockamp</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347,\n350 (1997)\n (noting that a statute that \xe2\x80\x9csets forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute, furthermore, runs from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s last culpable act (the offering of the securities), not from the accrual of the claim (the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the defect in the registration statement).  Under <i>CTS</i>, this point is close to a dispositive indication that the statute is one of repose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This view is confirmed by the two-sentence structure of \xc2\xa713.  In addition to the 3-year time bar, \xc2\xa713 contains a 1-year statute of limitations.  The limitations statute runs from the time when the plaintiff discovers (or should have discovered) the securities-law violation.  The pairing of a shorter statute of limitations and a longer statute of repose is a common feature of statutory time limits.  See, <i>e.g., Gabelli</i> v. <i>SEC</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442,\n453 (2013)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tatutes applying a discovery rule .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. often couple that rule with an absolute provision for repose\xe2\x80\x9d).  The two periods work together: The discovery rule gives leeway to a plaintiff who has not yet learned of a violation, while the rule of repose protects the defendant from an interminable threat of liability.  Cf. <i>Merck &amp; Co. </i>v. <i>Reynolds</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 633,\n650 (2010)\n (reasoning that 2-year discovery rule would not \xe2\x80\x9csubject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d because the statute also included an \xe2\x80\x9cunqualified bar on actions instituted \xe2\x80\x985 years after such violation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The history of the 3-year provision also supports its classification as a statute of repose.  It is instructive to note that the statute was not enacted in its current form.  The original version of the 1933 Securities Act featured a 2-year discovery period and a 10-year outside limit, see \xc2\xa713,\n\n48Stat.\n84, but Congress changed this framework just one year after its enactment.  The discovery period was changed to one year and the outside limit to three years.  See Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \xc2\xa7207,\n\n48Stat.\n908.  The evident design of the shortened statutory period was to protect defendants\xe2\x80\x99 financial security in fast-changing markets by reducing the open period for potential liability.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The determination that the 3-year period is a statute of repose is critical in this case, for the question whether a tolling rule applies to a given statutory time bar is one \xe2\x80\x9cof statutory intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lozano</i> v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8).  The purpose of a statute of repose is to create \xe2\x80\x9can absolute bar on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s temporal liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>CTS</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); and that purpose informs the assessment of whether, and when, tolling rules may apply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of the purpose of a statute of repose, the provision is in general not subject to tolling.  Tolling is permissible only where there is a particular indication that the legislature did not intend the statute to provide complete repose but instead anticipated the extension of the statutory period under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For example, if the statute of repose itself contains an express exception, this demonstrates the requisite intent to alter the operation of the statutory period.  See 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa71.1, pp. 4\xe2\x80\x935 (1991) (Corman); see, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71113 (establishing a 6-year statute of repose, but stipulating that, in case of fraud, the 6-year period runs from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the violation).  In contrast, where the legislature enacts a general tolling rule in a different part of the code\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g., </i>a rule that suspends time limits until the plaintiff reaches the age of majority\xe2\x80\x94courts must analyze the nature and relation of the legislative purpose of each provision to determine which controls.  See 2 Corman \xc2\xa710.2.1, at 108.  In keeping with the statute-specific nature of that analysis, courts have reached different conclusions about whether general tolling statutes govern particular periods of repose.  <i>Ibid.</i>, n. 15<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of course, not all tolling rules derive from legislative enactments.  Some derive from the traditional power of the courts to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98apply the principles .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of equity jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Young</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43,\n50 (2002)\n (alteration omitted).  The classic example is the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits a court to pause a statu-tory time limit \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a litigant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lozano</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 7).  Tolling rules of that kind often apply to statutes of limitations based on the presumption that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislate[s] against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The purpose and effect of a statute of repose, by contrast, is to override customary tolling rules arising from the equitable powers of courts.  By establishing a fixed limit, a statute of repose implements a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislative decisio[n] that as a matter of policy there should be a specific time beyond which a defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted liability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CTS</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___<i> </i>(slip op., at 7).  The unqualified nature of that determination supersedes the courts\xe2\x80\x99 residual authority and forecloses the extension of the statutory period based on equitable principles.  For this reason, the Court repeatedly has stated in broad terms that statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling.  See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938); <i>Lampf, Pleva, </i>501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 363.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner contends that the 3-year provision is subject to tolling based on the rationale and holding in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>American Pipe</i>.  The language of the 3-year statute does not refer to or impliedly authorize any exceptions for tolling.  If <i>American Pipe</i> had itself been grounded in a legislative enactment, perhaps an argument couldbe made that the enactment expressed a legislative objective to modify the 3-year period.  If, however, the tolling decision in <i>American Pipe</i> derived from equity principles, it cannot alter the unconditional language and purpose of the 3-year statute of repose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>American Pipe</i>, a timely class-action complaint was filed asserting violations of federal antitrust law.  414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 540.  Class certification was denied because the class was not large enough, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(1), and individuals who otherwise would have been members of the class then filed motions to intervene as individual plaintiffs.  The motions were denied on the grounds that the applicable 4-year time bar had expired.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715b.  The Court of Appeals reversed, permitting intervention.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court affirmed.  It held the individual plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motions to intervene were timely because \xe2\x80\x9cthe commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 554.  The Court reasoned that this result was consistent \xe2\x80\x9cboth with the procedures of Rule 23 and with the proper function of the limitations statute\xe2\x80\x9d at issue.  <i>Id.,</i> at 555.  First, the tolling furthered \xe2\x80\x9cthe purposes of litigative efficiency and economy\xe2\x80\x9d served by Rule 23.  <i>Id.,</i> at 556.  Without the tolling, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]otential class members would be induced to file protective motions to intervene or to join in the event that a class was later found unsuitable,\xe2\x80\x9d which would \xe2\x80\x9cbreed needless duplication of motions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 553\xe2\x80\x93554.  Second, the tolling was in accord with \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional operation of a statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 554.  By filing a class complaint within the statutory period, the named plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cnotifie[d] thedefendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 555.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As this discussion indicates, the source of the tolling rule applied in <i>American Pipe</i> is the judicial power to promote equity, rather than to interpret and enforce statutory provisions.  Nothing in the <i>American Pipe</i> opinion suggests that the tolling rule it created was mandated by the text of a statute or federal rule.  Nor could it have.  The central text at issue in <i>American Pipe</i> was Rule 23, and Rule 23 does not so much as mention the extension or suspension of statutory time bars.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding was instead grounded in the traditional equitable powers of the judiciary.  The Court described its rule as authorized by the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power to toll statutes of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 558; see also <i>id.,</i> at 555 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe tolling rule <i>we establish here</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The Court also relied on cases that are paradigm applications of equitable tolling principles, explaining with approval that tolling in one such case was based on \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations \xe2\x80\x98deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 559 (quoting <i>Glus</i> v. <i>Brooklyn Eastern Dist. Terminal</i>,\n\n359 U.\xc2\xa0S. 231,\n232 (1959)\n; alteration omitted); see also 414 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 559 (citing <i>Holmberg</i> v. <i>Armbrecht</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 392 (1946)\n).  The Court noted too that \xe2\x80\x9cbad faith\xe2\x80\x9d was not the cause of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of class certification.  414 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps for these reasons, this Court has referred to <i>American Pipe</i> as \xe2\x80\x9cequitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Department of Veterans Affairs</i>,\n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89\n, and n.\xc2\xa03 (1990); see also <i>Young, supra, </i>at 49; <i>Greyhound Corp.</i> v. <i>Mt. Hood Stages, Inc.</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322\n, n. (1978) (Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (using <i>American Pipe</i> as an example of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he authority of a federal court, sitting as a chancellor, to toll a statute of limitations on equitable grounds\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is true, however, that the <i>American Pipe</i> Court did not consider the criteria of the formal doctrine of equitable tolling in any direct manner.  It did not analyze, for example, whether the plaintiffs pursued their rights with special care; whether some extraordinary circumstance prevented them from intervening earlier; or whether the defendant engaged in misconduct.  See <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Florida</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 631,\n649 (2010)\n (identifying these considerations); <i>Young</i>, 535 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50 (same).  The balance of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning nonetheless reveals a rule based on traditional equitable powers, designed to modify a stat-utory time bar where its rigid application would create injustice.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This analysis shows that the <i>American Pipe</i> tolling rule does not apply to the 3-year bar mandated in \xc2\xa713.  As explained above, the 3-year limit is a statute of repose.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  And the object of a statute of repose, to grant complete peace to defendants, supersedes the application of a tolling rule based in equity.  See <i>supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  No feature of \xc2\xa713 provides that deviation from its time limit is permissible in a case such as this one.  To the contrary, the text, purpose, structure, and history of the statute all disclose the congressional purpose to offer defendants full and final security after three years.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner raises four counterarguments, but they are not persuasive.  First, petitioner contends that this case is indistinguishable from <i>American Pipe</i> itself.  If the 3-year bar here cannot be tolled, petitioner reasons, then there was no justification for the <i>American Pipe </i>Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary decision to suspend the time bar in that case.  <i>American Pipe</i>, however, is distinguishable.  The statute in <i>American Pipe</i> was one of limitations, not of repose; it began to run when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the cause of action accrued.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 541, n.\xc2\xa02 (quoting\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715b)<i>.</i>  The statute in the instant case, however, is a statute of repose.  Consistent with the different purposes embodied in statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, it is reasonable that the former may be tolled by equitable considerations even though the latter in most circumstances may not.  See <i>supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, petitioner argues that the filing of a class-action complaint within three years fulfills the purposes of a statutory time limit with regard to later filed suits by individual members of the class.  That is because, according to petitioner, the class complaint puts a defendant on notice as to the content of the claims against it and the set of potential plaintiffs who might assert those claims.  It is true that the <i>American Pipe</i> Court, in permitting tolling, suggested that generic notice satisfied the purposes of the statute of limitations in that case.  See 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 554\xe2\x80\x93555.  While this was deemed sufficient in balancing the equities to allow tolling under the antitrust statute, it must be noted that here the analysis differs because the purpose of a statute of repose is to give the defendant full protection after a certain time.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the number and identity of individual suits, where they may be filed, and the litigation strategies they will use are unknown, a defendant cannot calculate its potential liability or set its own plans for litigation with much precision.  The initiation of separate individual suits may thus increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s practical burdens.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Cottreau, Note, The Due Process Right To Opt Out of Class Actions, 73 N.\xc2\xa0Y. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 480, 486, and n. 29 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cA defendant\xe2\x80\x99s transaction costs are likely to be reduced by having to defend just one action\xe2\x80\x9d).  The emergence of individual suits, furthermore, may increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s financial liability; for plaintiffs who opt out have considerable leverage and, as a result, may obtain outsized recoveries.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Coffee, Accountability and Competition in Securities Class Actions: Why \xe2\x80\x9cExit\xe2\x80\x9d Works Better Than \xe2\x80\x9cVoice,\xe2\x80\x9d 30 Cardozo L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 407, 417, 432\xe2\x80\x93433 (2008); Perino, Class Action Chaos?  The Theory of the Core and an Analysis of Opt-Out Rights in Mass Tort Class Actions, 46 Emory L.\xc2\xa0J. 85, 97 (1997).  These uncertainties can put defendants at added risk in conducting business going forward, causing destabilization in markets which react with sensitivity to these matters.  By permitting a class action to splinter into individual suits, the application of <i>American Pipe</i> tolling would threaten to alter and expand a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s accountability, contradicting the substance of a statute of repose.  All this is not to suggest how best to further equity under these circumstances but simply to support the recognition that a statute of repose supersedes a court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable balancing powers by setting a fixed time period for claims to end.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, petitioner contends that dismissal of its individ-ual suit as untimely would eviscerate its ability to opt out, an ability this Court has indicated should not be disregarded.  See <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukes</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338,\n363 (2011)\n.  It does not follow, however, from any privilege to opt out that an ensuing suit can be filed without regard to mandatory time limits set by statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, petitioner argues that declining to apply <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to statutes of repose will create inefficiencies.  It contends that nonnamed class members will inundate district courts with protective filings.  Even if petitioner were correct, of course, this Court \xe2\x80\x9clack[s] the authority to rewrite\xe2\x80\x9d the statute of repose or to ignore its plain import.  <i>Baker Botts L. L. P.</i> v. <i>ASARCO LLC</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concerns likely are overstated.  Petitioner has not offered evidence of any recent influx of protective filings in the Second Circuit, where the rule affirmed here has been the law since 2013.  This is not surprising.  The very premise of class actions is that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Amchem Products, Inc.</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 591,\n617 (1997)\n.  Many individual class members may have no interest in protecting their right to litigate on an individ-ual basis.  Even assuming that they do, the process is un-likely to be as onerous as petitioner claims.  A simple motion to intervene or request to be included as a named plaintiff in the class-action complaint may well suffice.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6\xe2\x80\x9311 (describing procedures); Brief for Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16, 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (same).  District courts, furthermore, have ample means and methods to administer their dockets and to ensure that any additional filings proceed in an orderly fashion.  Cf. <i>Dietz</i> v. <i>Bouldin</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]istrict courts have the inherent authority to manage their dockets and courtrooms with a view toward the efficient and expedient resolution of cases\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner makes an alternative argument that does not depend on tolling.  Petitioner submits its individual suit was timely in any event.  Section 13 provides that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d within three years of the relevant securities offering.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777m.  Petitioner argues that requirement is met here because the filing of the class-action complaint \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d within the statutory time period.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument rests on the premise that an \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d when substantive claims are presented to any court, rather than when a particular complaint is filed in a particular court.  The term \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d however, refers to a judicial \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d or perhaps to a \xe2\x80\x9csuit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not to the general content of claims.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 41 (3d\xc2\xa0ed. 1933) (defining \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d as, <i>inter alia</i>, \xe2\x80\x9can ordinary proceeding in a court of justice\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>id.,</i> at 43 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe terms \xe2\x80\x98action\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98suit\xe2\x80\x99 are .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. nearly, if not entirely, synonymous\xe2\x80\x9d).  Whether or not petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual complaint alleged the same securities law violations as the class-action complaint, it defies ordinary understanding to suggest that its filing\xe2\x80\x94in a separate forum, on a separate date, by a separate named party\xe2\x80\x94was the same \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csuit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The limitless nature of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument, furthermore, reveals its implausibility.  It appears that, in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view, the bringing of the class action would make any subsequent action raising the same claims timely.  Taken to its logical limit, an individual action would be timely even if it were filed decades after the original securities offering\xe2\x80\x94provided a class-action complaint had been filed at some point within the initial 3-year period.  Congress would not have intended this result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument also fails because it is inconsistent with the reasoning in <i>American Pipe</i> itself.  If the filing of a class action made all subsequent actions by putative class members timely, there would be no need for tolling at all.  Yet this Court has described <i>American Pipe</i> as creating a tolling rule, necessary to permit the ensuing individual actions to proceed.  See, <i>e.g., American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 555; <i>Irwin</i>, 498 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 96, n.\xc2\xa03; <i>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co.</i> v. <i>Parker</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 345,\n350 (1983)\n.  Indeed, the <i>American Pipe</i> Court reasoned that the class-action complaint \xe2\x80\x9cwas filed with 11 days yet to run\xe2\x80\x9d in the statutory period, so the motions for intervention were timely only if filed within 11 days after the denial of class certification.  414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 561.  If the filing of the class action \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\xe2\x80\x9d any included individual actions, it would have sufficed for the Court to note the date on which the class action was filed and deem all subsequent individual actions proper, regardless when filed.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Tolling may be of great value to allow injured persons to recover for injuries that, through no fault of their own, they did not discover because the injury or the perpetrator was not evident until the limitations period otherwise would have expired.  This is of obvious utility in the securities market, where complex transactions and events can be obscure and difficult for a market participant to analyze or apprehend.  In a similar way, tolling as allowed in <i>American Pipe</i> may protect plaintiffs who anticipated their interests would be protected by a class action but later learned that a class suit could not be maintained for reasons outside their control.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The purpose of a statute of repose, on the other hand, is to allow more certainty and reliability.  These ends, too, are a necessity in a marketplace where stability and reliance are essential components of valuation and expectation for financial actors.  The statute in this case reconciles these different ends by its two-tier structure: a conventional statute of limitations in the first clause and a statute of repose in the second.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statute of repose transforms the analysis.  In a hypothetical case with a different statutory scheme, consisting of a single limitations period without an additional outer limit, a court\xe2\x80\x99s equitable power under <i>American Pipe</i> in many cases would authorize the relief petitioner seeks.  Here, however, the Court need not consider how equitable considerations should be formulated or balanced, for the mandate of the statute of repose takes the case outside the bounds of the <i>American Pipe</i> rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The final analysis, then, is straightforward.  The 3-year time bar in \xc2\xa713 of the Securities Act is a statute of repose.  Its purpose and design are to protect defendants against future liability.  The statute displaces the traditional power of courts to modify statutory time limits in the name of equity.  Because the <i>American Pipe</i> tolling rule is rooted in those equitable powers, it cannot extend the 3-year period.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s untimely filing of its individual action is ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">APPENDIX</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondents are the following financial securities firms: ANZ Securities, Inc.; Bankia, S.\xc2\xa0A.; BBVA Securities Inc.; BMO Capital Markets Corp.; BNP Paribas FS, LLC; BNP Paribas S.\xc2\xa0A.; BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC; CIBC World Markets Corp.; Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited; DZ Financial Markets LLC; HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.; HVB Capital Markets, Inc.; ING Financial Markets LLC; Mizuho Securities USA Inc.; M.\xc2\xa0R.

That complaint informed respondents of the substance of the claims asserted against them and the identities of potential claimants.  See <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538\n\xe2\x80\x93555 (1974); <i>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co.</i> v. <i>Parker</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 345,\n353 (1983)\n.  Respondents, in other words, received what \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s repose period was designed to afford them: notice of their potential liability within a fixed time window.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The complaint also \xe2\x80\x9ccommence[d] the action for all members of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 550.  Thus, when petitioner California Public Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System (CalPERS) elected to exercise the right safeguarded by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B)(v), <i>i.e.</i>, the right to opt out of the class and proceed independently, CalPERS\xe2\x80\x99 claim remained timely.  See <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 550 (demanding that class members \xe2\x80\x9cindividually meet the timeliness requirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is simply inconsistent with Rule 23\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given the due process underpinning of the opt-out right, see <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukes</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338,\n363 (2011)\n, I resist rendering the right illusory for CalPERS and similarly situated class members.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.  Accordingly, I dissent from today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, under which opting out cuts off any chance for recovery.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">CalPERS\xe2\x80\x99 claim against respondents was timely launched when the class representative filed a complaint pursuant to \xc2\xa711 of the Securities Act,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa777k, on behalf of all members of the described class, CalPERS among them.  See <i>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Utah</i>,\n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538,\n550 (1974)\n (under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, \xe2\x80\x9cthe filing of a timely class action complaint commences the action for all members of the class\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <i>ante</i>, at 3 (CalPERS was part of putative class).  Filing the class complaint within three years of the date the securities specified in that complaint were offered to the public also satisfied \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s statute of repose.  As the Court observes, <i>ante</i>, at 5, statutes of repose \xe2\x80\x9ceffect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from [facing] liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CTS Corp.</i> v. <i>Waldburger</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A repose period assures a party who might be drawn into litigation that, if no action is brought within a specified time, he will be off the hook.  But whether CalPERS stayed in the class or eventually filed separately, respondents would have known, within the repose period, of their potential liability to all putative class members.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A class complaint \xe2\x80\x9cnotifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co.</i> v. <i>Parker</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 345,\n353 (1983)\n (quoting <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 555).  The class complaint filed against respondents provided that very notice: It identified \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential information necessary to determine both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 555\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, the class of plaintiffs, the offering documents, and the alleged untrue statements and misleading omissions in those documents, see App. 50\xe2\x80\x9366.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant faced with [such] information about a potential liability to a class cannot be said to have reached a state of repose that should be protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  Developments in the Law: Class Actions, 89 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1318, 1451 (1976).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When CalPERS elected to pursue individually the claims already stated in the class complaint against the same defendants, it simply took control of the piece of the action that had always belonged to it.  CalPERS\xe2\x80\x99 statement of the same allegations in an individual complaint could not disturb anyone\xe2\x80\x99s repose, for respondents could hardly be at rest once notified of the potential claimants and the precise false or misleading statements alleged to infect the registration statements at issue.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  CalPERS\xe2\x80\x99 decision to opt out did change two things: (1) CalPERS positioned itself to exercise its constitutional right to go it alone, cutting loose from a monetary settlement it deemed insufficient; and (2) respondents had to deal with CalPERS and its attorneys in addition to the named plaintiff and class counsel.  Although those changes may affect how litigation subsequently plays out, see <i>ante</i>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, they do not implicate the concerns that prompted \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s repose period: The class complaint disclosed the same information respondents would have received had each class member instead filed an individual complaint on the day the class complaint was filed.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision disserves the investing public that \xc2\xa711 was designed to protect.  The harshest consequences will fall on those class members, often least sophisticated, who fail to file a protective claim within the repose period.  Absent a protective claim filed within that period, those members stand to forfeit their constitutionally shielded right to opt out of the class and thereby control the prosecution of their own claims for damages.  See <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukes</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338,\n363 (2011)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the context of a class action predominantly for money dam-ages,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cabsence of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. opt-out violates due process.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because critical stages of securities class actions, including the class-certification decision, often occur years after the filing of a class complaint,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] the risk is high that class members failing to file a protective claim will be sad-dled with inadequate representation or an inadequate judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s ruling will also gum up the works of class litigation.  Defendants will have an incentive to slow walk discovery and other precertification proceedings so the clock will run on potential opt outs.  Any class member with a material stake in a \xc2\xa711 case, including every fiduciary who must safeguard investor assets, will have strong cause to file a protective claim, in a separate complaint or in a motion to intervene, before the three-year period expires.  See Brief for Retired Federal Judges as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 9\xe2\x80\x9314.  Such filings, by increasing the costs and complexity of the litigation, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially burden the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 13.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision impels courts and class counsel to take on a more active role in protecting class members\xe2\x80\x99 opt-out rights.  See <i>id.</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  As the repose period nears expiration, it should be incumbent on class counsel, guided by district courts, to notify class members about the consequences of failing to file a timely protective claim.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt minimum, when notice goes out to a class beyond [\xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period], a district court will need to assess whether the notice [should] alert class members that opting out .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would end [their] chance for recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 20.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, I would hold that the filing of the class complaint commenced CalPERS\xe2\x80\x99 action under \xc2\xa711 of the Securities Act, thereby satisfying \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x99s statute of repose.
