Wilson, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1083">Page 419 U.S. 1081 , 1083</a></p><p> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html#522">405 U.S. 518, 522</a> (1972). See also Lewis v. City of New Orleans, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/130/case.html#134">415 U.S. 130, 134</a> (1974 ); Cohen v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/case.html#20">403 U.S. 15, 20</a> ( 1971). In that circumstance, it is irrelevant that the statute might constitutionally reach appellant\'s conduct, for "[a]lthough a statute may be neither vague, overbroad, nor otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he is permitted to raise its vagueness or unconstitutional over-breadth as applied to others. And if the law is found deficient in one of these respects, it may not be applied to him either, until and unless a satisfactory limiting construction is placed on the statute. The statute, in effect, is striken down on its face. . . ." Gooding v. Wilson, supra, 405 U.S. at 521, 92 S. Ct. 1103. </p><p> Gooding obviously compels reversal of the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court. The Court, however, dismisses this appeal for want of a properly presented federal question. But a dismissal on that ground would be appropriate only if the federal claim had not been raised in a proper and timely manner in the state courts. See, e. g., Bailey v. Anderson, <a href="/cases/federal/us/326/203/case.html">326 U.S. 203</a>, 206-207 (1945); Street v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/576/case.html">394 U.S. 576</a>, 581-585 (1969). That cannot possibly be said of this case. The unconstitutionality of 847.05 was the basic claim asserted by appellant and he urged it at every level in the state proceedings. And even were there doubt of this, and there can be none on this record, our jurisdiction still obtains since the Florida Supreme Court\'s sole ground of decision was based upon resolution of the federal question. \'There can be no question as to the proper presentation of a federal claim when the highest state court passes on it.\' Raley v. Ohio, <a href="/cases/federal/us/360/423/case.html#436">360 U.S. 423, 436</a> (1959). </p><p> Certainly it cannot be said that there is lack of a properly presented federal question because appellant was not con- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1084">Page 419 U.S. 1081 , 1084</a></p><p> victed for violating 847.05 but on the marihuana charge. His claim is that the marihuana seized from him and admitted in evidence against him was \'fruit of the poisonous tree\' because his initial arrest was pursuant to the unconstitutional 847.05. It may be that on remand his \'fruits\' claim will be rejected and the marihuana conviction reinstated. But the Florida Supreme Court did not speak to that question in light of its determination, based on holding 847.05 constitutional, that the initial arrest was valid. Appellant has properly presented the federal question decided by the Florida Supreme Court and our plain duty is to reverse that Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
