L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, for the purpose of "seek[ing] the eradication of organized crime in the United States," <i>id., </i>at 923. Congress found that "organized crime in the United States [had become] a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drain[ed] billions of dollars from America\'s economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption." <i>Id., </i>at 922. The result was to "weaken the stability of the Nation\'s economic system, harm innocent investors and competing organizations, interfere with free competition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine the general welfare of the Nation and its citizens." <i>Id., </i>at 923. Finding the existing "sanctions and remedies available to the Government [to be] unnecessarily limited in scope and impact," Congress resolved to address the problem of organized crime "by strengthening the legal tools in the evidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime." <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>RICO attempts to accomplish these goals by providing severe criminal penalties for violations of \xc2\xa7 1962, see \xc2\xa7 1963, and also by means of a civil cause of action for any person "injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962," 18 U.

Mezey, and Joseph S. Littenberg, are former senior officers and directors of SIG. Until 1990, when it declared bankruptcy, SIG was a Florida insurance holding company with three operating subsidiaries, each of which was engaged in the business of writing surety bonds for construction contractors.</p><p>Beginning in or around 1987, certain directors and officers of SIG, including respondents, began engaging in acts of racketeering. They created an entity called Construction Performance Corporation, which demanded fees from contractors in exchange for qualifying them for SI G surety bonds. Respondents also diverted corporate funds to personal uses and submitted false financial statements to regulators, shareholders, and creditors. During most of the time he was employed at SIG, petitioner was unaware of these activities. In early 1988, however, petitioner discovered respondents\' unlawful conduct and contacted regulators concerning the financial statements. Respondents then orchestrated a scheme to remove petitioner from the company. They hired an insurance consultant to write a false report suggesting that petitioner had failed to perform his material duties. The day after this report was presented to the SIG board of directors, the board fired petitioner, relying on a clause in his contract providing for termination in the event of an "inability or substantial failure to perform [his] material duties." App. 104. Petitioner sued respondents, asserting, among other things, a civil cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c).4 In particular, petitioner claimed that respondents used or invested income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity to establish and operate an enterprise, in violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(a); acquired and maintained an interest in</p><p>4 Petitioner\'s lawsuit was originally brought as a cross-claim in a shareholders\' derivative suit filed against SIG officers and directors, including petitioner, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

With respect to this last claim, petitioner\'s theory was that his injury was proximately caused by an overt act-namely, the termination of his employment-done in furtherance of respondents\' conspiracy, and that \xc2\xa7 1964(c) therefore provided a cause of action. Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that employees who are terminated for refusing to participate in RICO activities, or who threaten to report RICO activities, do not have standing to sue under RICO for damages from their loss of employment. The District Court agreed and dismissed petitioner\'s RICO conspiracy claim. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) is not available to a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a RICO conspiracy unless the overt act is an act of racketeering. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/162/1090/">162 F.3d 1090</a>, 1098 (CAll 1998). Since the overt act that allegedly caused petitioner\'s injury was not an act of racketeering, see \xc2\xa7 1961(1), it could not support a civil cause of action. The court held, "RICO was enacted with an express target-racketeering activity-and only those injuries that are proximately caused by racketeering activity should be actionable under the statute." <i>Ibid.</i>5</p><p>5 Although petitioner alleged violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1962(a), (b), and (c), the Court of Appeals concluded that he had presented no evidence of violations of subsections (a) and (b). It therefore treated each of petitioner\'s substantive RICO claims as alleging a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(c). 162 F. 3d, at 1095, n. 8. The court held that petitioner did not present evidence regarding elements of his \xc2\xa7 1962(c) claims and therefore affirmed the District Court\'s order granting summary judgment for respondents with respect to those claims. <i>Id., </i>at 1095-1098.

The majority of the Circuits to consider this question have answered it in the negative.

Section 1964(c) states that a cause of action is available to anyone "injured ... by reason of a violation of section 1962." Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful for a person "to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." To determine what it means to be "injured ... by reason of" a "conspir[acy]," we turn to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy.

In other words, our task is to interpret \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than \xc2\xa7 1962(d) standing alone.

See <i>post, </i>at 510-511, n. 5 (dissenting opinion). However, his quotations omit pertinent language. When read in context, it is clear that these passages refer to harm, not from any overt act, but only from overt acts that are themselves tortious.

See Ballentine\'s Law Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 1969) ("It is the civil wrong resulting in damage, and not the conspiracy which constitutes the cause of action"); Black\'s Law Dictionary 383 (4th ed. 1968) ("[W]here, in carrying out the design of the conspirators, overt acts are done causing <i>legal </i>damage, the person injured has a right of action" (emphasis added)). We presume, therefore, that when Congress established in RICO a civil cause of action for a person "injured ... by reason of" a "conspir[acy]," it meant to adopt these well-established common-law civil conspiracy principles.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS does not challenge our view that Congress meant to incorporate common-law principles when it adopted RICO. Nor does he attempt to make an affirmative case from the common law for his reading of the statute by pointing to a case in which there was (a) an illegal agreement; (b) injury proximately caused to the plaintiff by a nontortious overt act in furtherance of the agreement; and (c) recovery by the plaintiff. See <i>post, </i>at 508. Instead, he argues only that courts, authoritative commentators, and even dictionaries repeatedly articulated a rule with no meaning or application.8 We find this argument to be implausible</p><p>472, 479 (CADC 1983) (stating that civil conspiracy requires "an overt tortious act in furtherance of the agreement that causes injury .... Since liability for civil conspiracy depends on performance of some underlying tortious act, the conspiracy is not independently actionable; rather, it is a means for establishing vicarious liability for the underlying tort").</p><p>8We disagree, moreover, with JUSTICE STEVENS\' interpretation of the grounds for decision in some of the cases we have cited. For example, JUSTICE STEVENS reads <i>Mills </i>v. <i>Hansell, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/378/53/">378 F.2d 53</a> <i>(CA5 </i>1967) <i>(per curiam), </i>and <i>Chapman </i>v. <i>Pollock, </i>148 F. Supp. 769, 772 (WD Mo. 1957), to deny recovery for conspiracy because the defendants had not entered into an unlawful agreement. See <i>post, </i>at 508-509. We think the opinions, and the language cited from these opinions by JUSTICE STEVENS,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="505">505</a></p><p>and, accordingly, understand RICO to adopt the common-law principles we have cited. Interpreting the statute in a way that is most consistent with these principles, we conclude that injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO, see n. 7, <i>supra, </i>is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d). As at common law, a civil conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit under RICO based on injury caused by <i>any </i>act in furtherance of a conspiracy that might have caused the plaintiff injury. Rather, consistency with the common law requires that a RICO conspiracy plaintiff allege injury from an act that is analogous to an "ac[t] of a tortious character," see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7 876, Comment <i>b, </i>meaning an act that is in depend-</p><p>make clear that recovery was denied because the defendants had committed no actionable tort, regardless of whether they agreed to commit any such act. See <i>ibid. </i>Likewise, JUSTICE STEVENS reads <i>J. </i>&amp; C. <i>Ornamental Iron Co. </i>v. <i>Watkins, </i>114 Ga. App. 688, 691, 152 S. E. 2d 613, 615 (1966), to deny recovery because the plaintiff had suffered no injury. However, in that case, the plaintiff\'s conspiracy claim was predicated on several alleged torts including fraud, trespass, and malicious interference. <i>Ibid. </i>While the court held that the plaintiff could not recover for conspiracy to maliciously interfere because he had suffered no injury, the plaintiff\'s remaining conspiracy allegations were insufficient because the plaintiff did not allege "all the elements of a cause of action for the tort the same as would be required if there were no allegation of a conspiracy." <i>Ibid. </i>Further, JUSTICE STEVENS chides us for citing cases in which the court allowed recovery. But in two of these cases the court explicitly grounded its decision on the fact that the plaintiff had identified an actionable independent tort on which the conspiracy claim could be based. See <i>Cohen </i>v. <i>Bowdoin, </i>288 A. 2d 106, 110 (Me. 1972) ("[I]f [the plaintiff\'s conspiracy claim] is to be upheld as stating a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must be on the ground that the complaint sufficiently alleges the actual commission of the separate and independent tort of defamation against the plaintiff"); <i>Middlesex Concrete Products </i>&amp; <i>Excavating Corp. </i>v. <i>Carteret Indus. Assn., </i>37 N. J. 507, 516, 181 A. 2d 774, 779 (1962) (holding that the plaintiffs stated a claim for conspiracy because they alleged an actionable tort). In short, we think that there is ample evidence of the common-law rule we have cited.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="506">506</a></p><p>ently wrongful under RICO. The specific type of act that is analogous to an act of a tortious character may depend on the underlying substantive violation the defendant is alleged to have committed.9 However, respondents\' alleged overt act in furtherance of their conspiracy is not independently wrongful under any substantive provision of the statute. Injury caused by such an act is not, therefore, sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c).10</p><p>Petitioner challenges this view of the statute under the longstanding canon of statutory construction that terms in a statute should not be construed so as to render any provision of that statute meaningless or superfluous. He asserts that under our view of the statute, any person who had a claim for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) would necessarily have a claim for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(a), (b), or (c). However, contrary to petitioner\'s assertions, our interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) does not render it mere surplusage. Under our interpretation, a plaintiff could, through a \xc2\xa7 1964(c) suit for a violation of</p><p>9 For example, most courts of appeals have adopted the so-called investment injury rule, which requires that a plaintiff suing for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(a) allege injury from the defendant\'s "use or invest[ment]" of income derived from racketeering activity, see \xc2\xa7 1962(a). See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Crowe </i>v. <i>Henry, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/43/198/">43 F.3d 198</a>, 205 <i>(CA5 </i>1995); <i>Vemco, Inc. </i>v. <i>Camardella, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/23/129/">23 F.3d 129</a>, 132 <i>(CA6) </i>(collecting cases), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1017 (1994). Although we express no view on this issue, arguably a plaintiff suing for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) based on an agreement to violate \xc2\xa7 1962(a) is required to allege injury from the "use or invest[ment]" of illicit proceeds.</p><p>10 Respondents argue that a \xc2\xa7 1962(d) claim must be predicated on an <i>actionable </i>violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1962(a)-(c). However, the merit of this view is a different (albeit related) issue from the one on which we granted certiorari, namely, whether a plaintiff can bring a \xc2\xa7 1962(d) claim for injury flowing from an overt act that is not an act of racketeering. Therefore, contrary to JUSTICE STEVENS\' suggestion, see <i>post, </i>at 511-512, we do not resolve whether a plaintiff suing under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) for a RICO conspiracy must allege an actionable violation under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1962(a)-(c), or whether it is sufficient for the plaintiff to allege an agreement to complete a substantive violation and the commission of at least one act of racketeering that caused him injury.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="507">507</a></p><p>\xc2\xa7 1962(d), sue co-conspirators who might not themselves have violated one of the substantive provisions of \xc2\xa7 1962.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>We conclude, therefore, that a person may not bring suit under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) predicated on a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) for injuries caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise unlawful under the statute.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, dissenting.</p><p>For the purpose of decision, I assume-as I think the Court does-that petitioner has alleged an injury proximately caused by an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy that violated 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1962(d). In my judgment, the plain language of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) makes it clear that petitioner therefore has a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c), whether or not the overt act is a racketeering activity listed in \xc2\xa7 1961(1). The common-law civil conspiracy cases relied upon by the Court prove nothing to the contrary.</p><p>A "conspiracy" is an illegal agreement. There is, of course, a difference between the question whether an agreement is illegal and the question whether an admittedly illegal agreement gives rise to a cause of action for damages. Section 1962(d), which makes RICO conspiracies unlawful, addresses the former question; 1 \xc2\xa7 1964(c), which imposes civil</p><p>1 Those who participate in an illegal agreement to violate the substantive provisions of \xc2\xa7 1962(a), (b), or (c) have engaged in a conspiracy in violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d). See <i>Salinas </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/522/52/case.html">522 U. S. 52</a>, 63-65 (1997). Although "[t]here is no requirement of some overt act" to violate \xc2\xa7 1962(d), <i>id., </i>at 63, that, of course, does not mean that an agreement alone gives rise to civil liability under \xc2\xa7 1964(c).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="508">508</a></p><p>liability, concerns the latter. Section 1964(c) requires a person to be "injured in his business or property" by a violation before bringing an action for damages. And because that kind of injury only results from some form of overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, liability under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) naturally requires injury via an overt act.2 But there is nothing in either \xc2\xa7 1962(d) or \xc2\xa7 1964(c) requiring the overt act to be a racketeering activity as defined in \xc2\xa7 1961(1).3</p><p>The Court\'s central premise is that common-law civil conspiracy cases support the notion that liability cannot be imposed unless the overt act that furthered the conspiracy and harmed the plaintiff was a <i>particular kind </i>of overt act, namely, an act of a tortious character. But the cases cited by the Court do not support that point. First, no case cited by the majority actually parallels the Court\'s premise. That is, no case involved a situation in which (a) there was an illegal agreement, (b) there was an injury to the plaintiff proximately caused by an overt act in furtherance of that agreement, but (c) there was a refusal to impose civil liability because the overt act was not itself tortious.</p><p>Of the dozen cases cited by the Court, <i>ante, </i>at 501-503, half of them rejected liability because they did not satisfy condition (a) above, i. <i>e., </i>there was either no agreement or nothing illegal about the agreement that was made.

See <i>ante, </i>at 504-505, n. 8. At best, the Court\'s reading only demonstrates that in these cases the question whether the harmful overt act was a tort, on the one hand, and the question whether there was any illegal agreement or harm, on the other hand, are questions of overlapping substance. To the extent that is true, however, the point does not support the Court\'s view. Rather, it only proves that the cases cited do not parse out elements (a), (b), and (c) as the Court suggests they do. Moreover, as I stated at the outset, both the Court and I assume that there has been an illegal conspiracy in this case. If the cases the Court cites show that there was no illegal agreement at all because there was no actionable tort, then the cases cited by the Court simply contradict the central premise of the present case, and are therefore inapposite.</p><p>5 See <i>Earp </i>v. <i>Detroit, </i>16 Mich.

See also <i>Snipes </i>v. <i>West Flagler Kennel Club, Inc., </i>105 So. 2d 164, 165-167, and n. 1 (Fla. 1958), where the court upheld liability <i>exclusively </i>on precisely that premise.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="512">512</a></p><p>only qualifying "tortious act" must be "an act that is <i>independently wrongful under RICO." Ante, </i>at 505-506 (emphasis added).</p><p>And if one assumes further that the Court is correct to say that the only qualifying" \'ac[t] of a tortious character\'" is "an act that is independently wrongful under RICO," the analogy does not actually support what the Court has held. The majority holds that \xc2\xa7 1964(c) liability could be imposed if the overt acts injuring the plaintiff are among those racketeering activities listed in \xc2\xa7 1961(1)-such as murder, bribery, arson, and extortion. Racketeering activities, however, are <i>not </i>"independently wrongful under RICO." They are, of course, independently wrongful under other provisions of state and federal criminal law, but RICO does not make racketeering activity <i>itself </i>wrongful under the Act. The only acts that are "independently wrongful under RICO" are violations of the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1962. Thus, even accepting the Court\'s own analogy, if petitioner were harmed by predicate acts defined in \xc2\xa7 1961(1), that still would not, by itself, give rise to a cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c). Only if those racketeering activities <i>also </i>constituted a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(a), (b), or (c) would petitioner be harmed by "an act that is independently wrongful under RICO." And, of course, if petitioner were already harmed by conduct covered by one of those provisions, he would hardly need to use \xc2\xa7 1962(d)\'s conspiracy provision to establish a cause of action.</p><p>***</p><p>The plain language of RICO makes it clear that petitioner\'s civil cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1964(c) for a violation of \xc2\xa7 1962(d) does not require that he be injured in his business or property by any particular kind of overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Court\'s recitation of the common law of civil conspiracy does not prove otherwise, and, indeed, contradicts its own holding.</p><p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
