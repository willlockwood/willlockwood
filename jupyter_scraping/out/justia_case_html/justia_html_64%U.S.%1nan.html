The practice has been allowed in several cases, as will be seen by reference to  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/23/306/case.html#311">23 U.

In the last case, time was granted within which to give the bond, or the case be dismissed.  The bond may be taken and approved before any judge or justice authorized to allow the appeal or writ of error.</p>\n<p>Let the appellant have sixty days to give the bond, and file it with the clerk upon complying with which order the motion be dismissed; otherwise, granted.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
