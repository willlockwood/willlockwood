By articles of agreement between the two companies made on the 12th and 13th of July, 1869, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State on the nineteenth day of July, 1869, the two companies became consolidated into a new corporation under the name of the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad Company.</p>\n<p>On the day last named, the bonds, having been executed on the 1st of June, 1869, were deposited in the office of the treasurer of state, who was required by the statute to "hold the same as trustee of the municipality issuing the same, and for the railroad company for which they were issued."

Upon such transfer, the company\'s acceptances theretofore given for its debts were surrendered and the debts discharged.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>1. On behalf of the plaintiff in error it is contended that by the settled law of Michigan as it existed when the bonds were issued, they were void.  In support of that position we are referred to <em>People v. Salem,</em> 20 Mich. 452, decided May 26, 1870; <em>Bay City v. State Treasurer,</em> 23 Mich. 499, and <em>Thomas v. Port Huron,</em> 27 Mich. 320.  This question was fully considered in <em>Taylor v. Ypsilanti, supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/105/60/case.html">105 U. S. 60</a></span>, where we ruled that by the law of Michigan as expounded by its Supreme Court and acted upon by its legislature and executive departments prior to the decision in <em>People v. Salem,</em> bonds issued in conformity with the Act of March 22, 1869, were valid obligations of the municipality by whom they were issued.  For the reasons there stated, the present objection cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>2. Equally untenable is the proposition that the rights and obligations of the parties are to be determined by the law as expounded by the supreme court of the state at the time the defendant in error in fact received the bonds.  The defendant in error is a holder for value.  <em>Railroad Company v. National Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/14/case.html">102 U. S. 14</a></span>.  But if not, it is still entitled to whatever rights the railroad company had by virtue of its contract with the township.  That contract was made and fully performed before the decision in <em>People v. Salem</em> was rendered and, as already indicated, was not affected by the decision in that case.</p>\n<p>3. Nor is it a material circumstance that this was a donation, and not a subscription of stock.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/667/case.html">Railroad Company v. County of Otoe,</a></span></em> 16 Wall. 667, it was held that in the absence of constitutional provisions making a distinction between municipal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 105 U. S. 76</a></p><p> subscriptions to stock and municipal appropriations of money or credit, there was no solid ground upon which, so far as legislative power was concerned, to rest such a distinction.</p>\n<p>"Both are for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the road; both are aimed at the same object, securing a public advantage, obtaining a highway or an avenue to the markets of the country; both may be equally burdensome to the taxpayers."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/678/case.html">Olcott v. The Supervisors,</a></span></em> 16 Wall. 678; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/86/83/case.html">Town of Queensbury v. Culver,</a></span></em> 19 Wall. 83.</p>\n<p>4. The only remaining objection to the judgment is that the bonds were delivered to the consolidated company when they were not voted to that company.  We concur with the court below in holding that the aid voted must be deemed to have been given in view of the then existing statute, authorizing two or more railroad companies forming a continuous or connected line to consolidate and form one corporation and investing the consolidated company with the powers, rights, property, and franchises of the constituent companies.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/86/241/case.html">Nugent v. The Supervisors,</a></span></em> 19 Wall. 241; <em>County of Scotland v. Thomas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/682/case.html">94 U. S. 682</a></span>; <em>Town of East Lincoln v. Davenport,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/801/case.html">94 U. S. 801</a></span>; <em>Wilson v. Salamanca,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/499/case.html">99 U. S. 499</a></span>; <em>Empire v. Darlington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/87/case.html">101 U. S. 87</a></span>; <em>Menasha v.

Kernochan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/562/case.html">103 U. S. 562</a></span>; <em>County of Tipton v. Locomotive Works,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/103/523/case.html">103 U. S. 523</a></span>.  The bonds were therefore rightly delivered to the new or consolidated corporation.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>Mr. JUSTICE GRAY did not sit in this case nor take any part in deciding it.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
