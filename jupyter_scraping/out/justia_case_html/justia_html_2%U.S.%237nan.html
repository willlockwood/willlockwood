To decide in the affirmative, the case must either be embraced by the general provision of the act for defalcation (1 Vol. Dall. Edit. p. 65.) or by the 39th Rule of the Supreme Court. Now, although our act of Assembly extends further than the British statutes of set-off (2 Geo. 2. c. 22. and 8 Geo. 2. c. 24) we do not think it comprehends a defalcation of the nature contended for: And, though the 39th Rule of the Court ascertains what evidence is admissible on the plea of payment, it contains nothing descriptive of the present circumstances, where there was a good consideration for the bond, though the defendants have been injured by the subsequent conduct of the plaintiffs. </p><p> If, however, the defendants would otherwise be without a remedy, we should be solicitous, by any rational construction of <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="239">[2 U.S. 237, 239]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1921499">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> KACHLIN v.
