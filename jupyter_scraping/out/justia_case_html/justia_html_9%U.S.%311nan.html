CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The Court thinks this case too plain to admit of argument or to require deliberation.  It is not within even the letter of the law, and it is certainly not within its spirit.  The law did not intend to punish the intention, but the attempt to defraud the revenue. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 9 U.

A doubt as to the true construction of the law is as reasonable a cause for seizure as a doubt respecting the fact.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
