In consideration of the premises, the said Construction Company agrees to transfer and deliver to the said New Albany Company three-fourths of the entire capital stock of the said Beattyville Company, the said delivery to proceed <em>pari passu</em> with the guarantying of the said bonds by the said New Albany Company, $3,000 at par of the said stock being delivered for each $4,000 of bonds guarantied."</p>\n<p>This contract was dated October 9, 1889, was signed in the name of each company by its president and secretary and under its corporate seal, and a copy of it was spread upon the records of the board of directors of the New Albany Company.</p>\n<p>The charges of fraud against the directors who took part in that meeting were disproved, and the evidence failed to establish that the meeting was not in every respect a lawful one.</p>\n<p>But no petition of a majority of the stockholders for the execution of the guaranty was presented, as required by the statute of Indiana of 1883, above cited.  Nor was there any evidence that the stockholders ever authorized or ratified the contract between the New Albany Company and the Construction Company or the guaranty executed in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to that contract, and before March 12, 1890, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 174 U.

The Louisville Trust Company and the Louisville Banking Company and other bondholders appealed to the circuit court of appeals, which reversed the decree of the circuit court and ordered the bill to be dismissed as to the Louisville Trust Company and the Louisville Banking Company, except as to the forty-five bonds held by the latter company, and, as to these bonds, ordered an injunction against suits on the guaranty against the plaintiff as a corporation of Indiana and Illinois, and that there be stamped on each of these forty-five bonds, under its guaranty, these words,</p>\n<p>"This guaranty is binding only on the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, a corporation of Kentucky.  It is not binding on the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, a corporation of Indiana and Illinois."</p>\n<p>75 F. 433.

The said New Albany Company agrees to and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 174 U.

In consideration of the premises, the said Construction Company agrees to transfer and deliver to the said New Albany Company three-fourths of the entire capital stock of the said Beattyville Company, the said delivery to proceed <em>pari passu</em> with the guarantying of the said bonds by the said New Albany Company, $3,000 at par of the said stock being delivered for each $4,000 of bonds guarantied."</p>\n<p>This contract was dated October 9, 1889, was signed in the name of each company by its president and secretary and under its corporate seal, and a copy of it was spread upon the records of the board of directors of the New Albany Company.</p>\n<p>The charges of fraud against the directors who took part in that meeting were disproved, and the evidence failed to establish that the meeting was not in every respect a lawful one.</p>\n<p>But no petition of a majority of the stockholders for the execution of the guaranty was presented, as required by the statute of Indiana of 1883, above cited.  Nor was there any evidence that the stockholders ever authorized or ratified the contract between the New Albany Company and the Construction Company or the guaranty executed in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to that contract, and before March 12, 1890, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 174 U. S. 560</a></p><p> stock of the Beattyville Company was delivered to the New Albany Company; a guaranty, in the terms specified in the fourth article of that contract, and bearing the signature of the New Albany Company, by its president and secretary, and its corporate seal, was placed on 1,185 bonds, for $1,000 each, of the Beattyville Company; and the bonds thus guarantied were put on the market by the Construction Company.</p>\n<p>On March 12, 1890, the annual meeting of the stockholders of the New Albany Company was held, a new board of directors was elected, and the meeting was adjourned to March 22, 1890, when it was voted by a majority of the stockholders to reject and disapprove the contract with the Construction Company and the guaranty placed on the bonds of the Beattyville Company, as having been made without legal authority or the approval of the stockholders, and to empower the board of directors to take all proceedings necessary or proper to cancel such contract and guaranty and to relieve the company from an  obligation or liability by reason thereof.</p>\n<p>Many of the bonds so guarantied and put on the market, including one hundred twenty-five bonds purchased by the Louisville Trust Company and ten bonds purchased by the Louisville Banking Company, were taken from the Construction Company by the purchasers in good faith, and without notice or knowledge that there had been no petition of a majority of the stockholders for the execution of the guaranty, and forty-five of the bonds were purchased from the Construction Company by the Louisville Banking Company after the meeting in March, 1890, and with notice that the majority of the stockholders had not petitioned for, but had disapproved, the guaranty.</p>\n<p>The Beattyville Company and the Construction Company went on with the work of constructing the Beattyville Railroad until the summer of 1890, when they both became insolvent, and their property passed into the hands of receivers.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff, in its bill, tendered back the stock which it had received, and the stock was deposited in the office of the clerk of the court.</p>\n<p>The circuit court entered a decree for the plaintiff against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 174 U. S. 561</a></p><p> all the defendants.  69 F. 431.  The Louisville Trust Company and the Louisville Banking Company and other bondholders appealed to the circuit court of appeals, which reversed the decree of the circuit court and ordered the bill to be dismissed as to the Louisville Trust Company and the Louisville Banking Company, except as to the forty-five bonds held by the latter company, and, as to these bonds, ordered an injunction against suits on the guaranty against the plaintiff as a corporation of Indiana and Illinois, and that there be stamped on each of these forty-five bonds, under its guaranty, these words,</p>\n<p>"This guaranty is binding only on the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, a corporation of Kentucky.  It is not binding on the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, a corporation of Indiana and Illinois."</p>\n<p>75 F. 433.  The plaintiff applied for and obtained these writs of certiorari.  164 U.S. 707.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff, the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, undoubtedly became a corporation of the State of Indiana in 1873, by its incorporation according to the general statute of 1865 of that state.</p>\n<p>Whether it afterwards became a corporation of the State of Kentucky also was strongly contested at the bar, and depends upon the legal effect of the statute of Kentucky of 1880.</p>\n<p>That statute (being the first statute of Kentucky affecting this corporation) is described -- indeed, in its title, as well as in the title of the statute of 1882 amending it -- as "An act to incorporate" this company, although, in the title of the first </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 174 U. S. 562</a></p><p> statute, the word "Louisville" in its name is omitted.  By the first words of the enacting part of the statute of 1880, it is "the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Indiana," and not any other corporation, or any association of natural persons, that is "hereby constituted a corporation," with the usual powers of corporations, and with "authority to operate a railroad."  And it is the corporation so described that, by the other provisions of that statute, may purchase, lease, or condemn real estate required for railroad purposes in the County of Jefferson, and may connect with any other railroad in that county or build, lease, or operate any such connecting line, "and may bond the same, and secured the payment of any such bonds by a mortgage of its property, rights and franchises," and, by the amendatory statute of 1882, may guaranty the bonds of, or consolidate with, other corporations authorized to construct railroads in Kentucky.</p>\n<p>This Court has often recognized that a corporation of one state may be made a corporation of another state by the legislature of that state in regard to property and acts within its territorial jurisdiction.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/66/286/case.html">Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad Company v.

James,</em> the company was organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of Missouri in 1873, and owned a railroad extending from Monett, in that state, to the boundary line between it and the State of Arkansas.  The Constitution of the State of Arkansas provided that foreign corporations might be authorized to do business in this state under such limitations and restrictions as might be prescribed by law, but should not have power to appropriate or condemn private property.  The Legislature of Arkansas, by a statute of 1881, provided that any railroad company incorporated by or under the laws of any other state, and having a line of railroad to the boundary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 174 U. S. 564</a></p><p> of Arkansas, might, for the purpose of continuing its line of railroad into this state, purchase the property, rights, and franchises of any railroad company organized under the laws of this state, and thereby acquire the right of eminent domain possessed by that company, and hold, construct, own, and operate the railroad so purchased as fully as that company might have done, and that "said foreign railroad company" should be subject to all the provisions of all statutes relating to railroad corporations, including the service of process, and should keep an office in the state.  Pursuant to that statute, the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway Company, in 1882, purchased from railroad corporations of Arkansas their railroads, franchises, and property, including a railroad connecting at the boundary line with its own railroad and extending to Fort Smith in Arkansas, and thenceforth owned and operated a continuous line of railroad from Monett, in Missouri, to Fort Smith in Arkansas.  In 1889 the Legislature of Arkansas passed another statute providing that every railroad corporation of any other state which had purchased a railroad in this state should, within sixty days from the passage of this act, file a copy of its articles of incorporation or charter with the Secretary of State of Arkansas, and should "thereupon become a corporation of this state, anything in its articles of incorporation or charter to the contrary notwithstanding."  And the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway Company forthwith filed with the Secretary of State of Arkansas a copy of its articles of incorporation under the laws of Missouri, as required by this statute.</p>\n<p>In an action brought by a citizen of Missouri against that company in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Arkansas to recover for its negligence on that part of its road within the State of Missouri, the company pleaded, to the jurisdiction, that it was a citizen of Missouri, and the question was certified to this Court whether the company, by filing a copy of its articles of incorporation under the laws of Missouri with the Secretary of State of Arkansas and continuing to operate its railroad through that state, became a corporation and citizen of the State of Arkansas. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 174 U. S. 565</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court, speaking by MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS, upon a careful review of the earlier cases, answered that question in the negative.</p>\n<p>The fundamental proposition deduced from the previous decisions was thus stated:</p>\n<p>"There is an indisputable legal presumption that a state corporation, when sued or suing in a circuit court of the United States, is composed of citizens of the state which created it; and hence such a corporation is itself deemed to come within that provision of the Constitution of the United States which confers jurisdiction upon the federal courts in \'controversies between citizens of different states.\'"</p>\n<p>The Court frankly recognized that</p>\n<p>"it is competent for a railroad corporation organized under the laws of one state, when authorized so to do by the consent of the state which created it, to accept authority from another state to extend its railroad into such state, and to receive a grant of powers to own and control, by lease or purchase, railroads therein, and to subject itself to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the second state,"</p>\n<p>and that "such corporations may be treated by each of the states whose legislative grants they accept as domestic corporations."   <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html#562">161 U. S. 161</a></span> U.S. 562.</p>\n<p>But the Court went on to say:</p>\n<p>"The presumption that a corporation is composed of citizens of the state which created it accompanies such corporation when it does business in another state, and it may sue or be sued in the federal courts in such other state as a citizen of the state of its original creation."</p>\n<p>And, after referring to the provisions of the statutes of Arkansas of 1881 and 1889, the Court added:</p>\n<p>"But, whatever may be the effect of such legislation in the way of subjecting foreign railroad companies to control and regulation by the local laws of Arkansas, we cannot concede that it availed to create an Arkansas corporation out of a foreign corporation in such a sense as to make it a citizen of Arkansas within the meaning of the federal Constitution, so as to subject it as such to a suit by a citizen of the state of its origin.  In order to bring such an artificial body as a corporation within the spirit and letter of that Constitution, as construed by the decisions of this Court, it would be necessary to create </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 174 U. S. 566</a></p><p> it out of natural persons whose citizenship of the state creating it could be imputed to the corporation itself."</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html#562">161 U. S. 161</a></span> U.S. 562,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/545/case.html#565">161 U. S. 565</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In that case, the Constitution of Arkansas denied to foreign corporations the right of eminent domain, and the Missouri corporation acquired that right, and owned and operated a railroad in Arkansas, in virtue of statutes authorizing it to purchase the property, rights, and franchises of Arkansas corporations, and requiring it to file a copy of its articles of incorporation or charter with the Secretary of State of Arkansas, and enacting that it should "thereupon become a corporation of this state, anything in its articles of incorporation or charter to the contrary notwithstanding."  Yet it was held that it was not thereby made a corporation of Arkansas in the sense of the provisions of the Constitution and of the acts of congress conferring jurisdiction on the courts of the United States by reason of diverse citizenship.</p>\n<p>The statutes of Arkansas in that case went quite as far, to say the least, towards constituting a corporation of another state a corporation of the state enacting those statutes, as the statutes of Kentucky did in the case at bar.</p>\n<p>The consolidation of the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company, under the same name with a railroad company of Illinois in 1881 clearly does not affect the question of jurisdiction.  That consolidation appears, by cases cited at the bar, to have been in accordance with the law of Indiana, but not to have been authorized by the law of Illinois.  <em>Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway v. Boney,</em> 117 Ind. 501; <em>American Trust Co. v. Minnesota &amp; Northwestern Railroad,</em> 157 Ill. 641.  It may have been ratified by very recent legislation in Illinois.  Illinois Stat.

But jurisdiction of a suit, once acquired by a court of the United States by reason of the requisite citizenship, is not lost by a change in the citizenship of either party pending the suit.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/15/290/case.html">Morgan v.

Variety Co.,</em> 62 F. 356.</p>\n<p>The real question in the case is whether this guaranty was valid under the laws of Indiana, the state by which the guarantor was originally created a corporation and as a corporation of which it brought this suit.</p>\n<p>Some reliance was placed upon the statute of Indiana of 1865 authorizing any railroad company incorporated under its provisions (as the New Albany Company was) to consolidate with any railroad corporation having a connecting line either within or without the state, or to acquire, by purchase or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 174 U. S. 568</a></p><p> contract, its property, rights, and franchises, or the use and enjoyment thereof, in whole or in part, and to "assume such of the debts and liabilities of such corporations as may be deemed proper."  It was argued that the powers thus given embraced the contract by which the New Albany Company agreed with the Construction Company, in consideration of receiving from it a controlling interest in the stock of the Beattyville Company, to guaranty the bonds of that company.</p>\n<p>But the New Albany Company never consolidated itself with the Beattyville Company, or acquired by purchase or contract its property, rights, and franchises, or the use or enjoyment thereof, in whole or in part.  It is doubtful, to say the least, whether a mere purchase of three-fourths of its stock could authorize an assumption of its debts, under the statute of 1865, if that statute had remained in full force.  In <em>Hill v. Nisbet,</em> 100 Ind. 341, cited at the bar, a purchase of the stock of one railroad company by another was upheld not as equivalent to a purchase of the property and franchises, but as a reasonable means to the accomplishment of the consolidation of the two companies.</p>\n<p>But we cannot doubt that, as was held by both courts below, the statute of Indiana of 1883 superseded and repealed, as to matters within its scope and terms, the provisions of all former statutes of the state on the subject.</p>\n<p>The statute of Indiana of 1883 is entitled</p>\n<p>"An act to authorize railroad corporations organized under the laws of the State of Indiana to endorse and guaranty the bonds of any railroad company organized under the laws of any adjoining state,"</p>\n<p>and enacts, in section 1, that</p>\n<p>"the board of directors of any railway company organized under and pursuant to the laws of the State of Indiana whose line of railway extends across the state in either direction may, upon the petition of the holders of a majority of the stock of such railway company, direct the execution by such railway company of an endorsement guarantying the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds of any railway company organized under or pursuant to the laws of any adjoining state the construction of whose line or lines of railway would be beneficial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 174 U. S. 569</a></p><p> to the business or traffic of the railway so endorsing or guarantying such bonds."</p>\n<p>Section 2 provides that such petition of the stockholders shall state the facts relied on to show the benefits accruing to "the company endorsing or guarantying the bonds," and section 3 provides that "no railway company shall, under the provisions of this act," endorse or guaranty such bonds to an amount exceeding half the par value of the stock of "the railway company so endorsing or guarantying."</p>\n<p>The Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company was a railway company organized under and pursuant to the laws of Indiana, and its line of railway extended across the state from south to north.  On October 8, 1889, the board of directors, at a regular meeting, passed a resolution, entered upon its records, authorizing the president and secretary to execute, under seal of the company, a contract by which the company agreed with a corporation which was constructing the railroad of the Beattyville Company, a railroad corporation of Kentucky, to guaranty the payment by the Beattyville Company of the principal and interest of bonds of that company by endorsing on each bond a guaranty, executed in like manner, by which,</p>\n<p>"for value received, the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company hereby guaranties to the holder of the within bond the payment, by the obligor thereon, of the principal and interest thereof in accordance with the tenor thereof."</p>\n<p>The contract, as well as the guaranty on many of the bonds, was accordingly executed by the president and secretary, and under the seal of the company, and the contract was spread upon the records of the board of directors.  No petition of a majority of the stockholders for the execution of the guaranty was ever presented, as required by the statute; there was no evidence that the stockholders ever authorized or ratified the contract or the guaranty; and, at the next annual meeting of the stockholders in March, 1890, it was voted to reject and disapprove both the contract and the guaranty as having been made without legal authority or the approval of the stockholders.</p>\n<p>Before that meeting was held, one hundred and twenty-five </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 174 U. S. 570</a></p><p> of the bonds thus guarantied had been sold by the Construction Company to the Louisville Trust Company, and ten bonds to the Louisville Banking Company, each of which companies took those bonds in good faith and without notice that no petition had been presented by a majority of the stockholders for the execution of the guaranty.</p>\n<p>Forty-five more of the bonds were purchased by the Louisville Banking Company from the Construction Company after that meeting, and with notice that a majority of the stockholders had never petitioned for, but had disapproved, the execution of the guaranty.  The Louisville Banking Company, thus having notice, when it took these forty-five bonds, that the prerequisite to the execution of the guaranty, under the statute of Indiana of 1883, had not been complied with, was not a <em>bona fide</em> holder of these bonds, and should not be allowed to enforce the guaranty thereon against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The controverted question is whether the bonds which the Louisville Trust Company and the Louisville Banking Company, respectively, purchased in good faith, and without notice of the want of the assent of the majority of the stockholders, are valid in the hands of these companies.</p>\n<p>The guaranty by the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company of the bonds of the Beattyville Company was not <em>ultra vires</em> in the sense of being outside the corporate powers of the former company, for the statute of 1883 expressly authorized such a company to execute such a guaranty, and its board of directors to direct its execution by the company.  The statute, indeed, made it a prerequisite to the action of the board of directors that it should be upon the petition of a majority of the stockholders, but this was only a regulation of the mode and the agencies by which the corporation should exercise the power granted to it.</p>\n<p>The distinction between the doing by a corporation of an act beyond the scope of the powers granted to it by law, on the one side, and an irregularity in the exercise of the granted powers, on the other, is well established, and has been constantly recognized by this court.</p>\n<p>It was clearly indicated in two of its earliest judgments on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="571">Page 174 U.

The directors of three railroad corporations made a contract with another railroad corporation to guaranty its bonds as part of an arrangement for connecting the four roads, and the bonds were accordingly guarantied, and were issued to <em>bona fide</em> holders without any meeting of the stockholders having been called.  But, upon evidence that the stockholders had subsequently assented to the transaction, the bonds were held to be valid, and the court expressly declared that the doctrine that a corporation cannot vary from the object of its creation, and that persons dealing with a company must take notice of whatever is contained in the law of its organization, does not apply to</p>\n<p>"those cases in which a corporation acts within the range of its general authority, but fails to comply with some formality or regulation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 174 U.

S. 24</a></span>, this Court, in summing up the result of previous decisions, stated the same distinction as follows:</p>\n<p>"A contract of a corporation which is <em>ultra vires</em> in the proper sense -- that is to say, outside the object of its creation as defined in the law of its organization, and therefore beyond the powers conferred upon it by the legislature -- is not voidable only, but wholly void and of no legal effect.  The objection to the contract is not merely that the corporation ought not to have made it, but that it could not make it.  The contract cannot be ratified by either party because it could not have been authorized by either.  No performance on either side can give the unlawful contract any validity or be the foundation of any right of action upon it.  When a corporation is acting within the general scope of the powers conferred upon it by the legislature, the corporation, as well as persons contracting with it, may be estopped to deny that it has complied with the legal formalities which are prerequisites to its existence or to its action, because such requisites might in fact have been complied with.  But when the contract is beyond the powers conferred upon it by existing laws, neither the corporation nor the other party to the contract can be estopped by assenting to it or by acting upon it to show that it was prohibited by those laws."</p>\n<p>139 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/139/24/case.html#59">139 U.

The defense was that no such resolution had been passed, and that the bond had been given without the authority of the shareholders.  The Court of Exchequer Chamber, affirming the judgment of the Queen\'s Bench, without passing upon the sufficiency of the resolution in that case, held the company liable on the bond, and, speaking by Chief Justice Jervis, said:</p>\n<p>"We may now take for granted that the dealings with these companies are not like dealings with other partnerships, and that the parties dealing with them are bound to read the statute and the deed of settlement.  But they are not bound to do more.  And the party here, in reading the deed of settlement, would find, not a prohibition from borrowing, but a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 174 U.
