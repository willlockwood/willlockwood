Respondents Robert Mills and Richard Pierce were convicted of a later murder of another inmate at the same institution.  Prison officials placed each respondent in administrative detention shortly after the murders, and they remained there for an extended period of time before they were eventually indicted on criminal charges.  On appeal of respondents\' convictions, the en banc Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held by divided vote that they had a Sixth Amendment right to an attorney during the period in which they were held in administrative detention before the return of indictments against them, and that, because they had been denied that right, their convictions had to be overturned and their indictments dismissed.  704 F.2d 1116 (1983).  We granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals\' novel application of our Sixth Amendment precedents, 464 U.S. 913 (1983), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p>On November 11, 1978, Thomas Trejo, an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Lompoc, Cal., was found dead from 45 stab wounds in the chest.  Prison officials and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation began independent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 467 U. S. 183</a></p><p> investigations of the murder.  Prison officials immediately suspected respondents Reynoso and Gouveia, and placed them in the Administrative Detention Unit (ADU) at Lompoc.  They were released back into the general prison population on November 22, 1978, but after officials obtained further information about the murder, on December 4, 1978, they returned Reynoso and Gouveia to the ADU, and placed respondents Segura and Ramirez in the ADU as well.  Later in December, prison officials held disciplinary hearings, determined that all four respondents had participated in the murder of inmate Trejo, and ordered their continued confinement in the ADU.  While in the ADU, respondents were separated from the general prison population and confined to individual cells.  Although their participation in various prison programs was curtailed, they were still allowed regular visitation rights, exercise periods, access to legal materials, and unmonitored phone calls.  704 F.2d at 1118; <em>see generally</em> 28 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 541.19, 541.20(d) (1983).  Respondents remained in the ADU without appointed counsel for approximately 19 months.  On June 17, 1980, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against respondents on charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1111 and 1117, respectively.  On July 14, 1980, respondents were arraigned in federal court, at which time a Federal Magistrate appointed counsel for them.</p>\n<p>Before trial, respondents filed a motion to dismiss their indictments, arguing that the delay of approximately 19 months between the commission of the crime and the return of the indictments violated their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment or, alternatively, their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, and that their confinement in the ADU without appointment of counsel during that period violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The District Court for the Central District of California denied their motion, and respondents proceeded to trial.  Their first trial, which lasted approximately four weeks, ended in a mistrial.  On retrial, respondents were convicted on both counts and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 467 U. S. 184</a></p><p> were sentenced to consecutive life and 99-year terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The scenario is much the same in the case of Mills and Pierce.  Inmate Thomas Hall was stabbed to death at Lompoc on August 22, 1979.  Immediately afterwards, Mills and Pierce were examined by a prison doctor and questioned by FBI agents regarding the murder.  Prison officials suspected them of involvement in the murder and placed them in the ADU pending further investigation.  On September 13, 1979, prison officials conducted a disciplinary hearing, concluded that respondents had murdered inmate Hall, and ordered their continued confinement in the ADU, where they remained for the next eight months.  On March 27, 1980, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Mills and Pierce on charges of first-degree murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1111 and of conveyance of a weapon in prison in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1792, and against Pierce on a charge of assault in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 113(c).  At the time of their arraignment on April 21, 1980, Mills and Pierce were appointed counsel and were released from the ADU.</p>\n<p>Before trial, Mills and Pierce also filed a motion to dismiss their indictments, alleging that the 8-month preindictment delay violated their Fifth Amendment due process rights and their Sixth Amendment speedy trial right, and that their confinement without counsel for that period violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The District Court for the Central District of California granted the motion to dismiss.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for trial, holding that respondents\' Sixth Amendment rights were not triggered during their administrative segregation because they had not yet been arrested and accused, and that respondents had made an insufficient showing of actual prejudice from the preindictment delay so as to justify dismissal of the indictments on due process grounds.  <em>United States v. Mills,</em> 641 F.2d 785, <em>cert. denied,</em> 454 U.S. 902 (1981).  Respondents Mills and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 467 U. S. 185</a></p><p> Pierce were then convicted on all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, proceeding en banc, consolidated the appeals of all six respondents and addressed only the issue of whether the Sixth Amendment requires the appointment of counsel before indictment for indigent inmates confined in administrative detention while being investigated for criminal activities.  704 F.2d at 1119. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court of Appeals majority recognized that a plurality of this Court had concluded in <em>Kirby v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html">406 U. S. 682</a></span> (1972), that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only when formal judicial proceedings are initiated against an individual by way of indictment, information, arraignment, or preliminary hearing.  The majority recognized that no such proceedings had been initiated against respondents during the period of time for which they asserted a right to appointed counsel in this case.</p>\n<p>The majority went on to note, however, that <em>Kirby</em> is not a prison case and that the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered is different in the prosecution of prison crimes.  704 F.2d at 1120.  In so holding, the majority analogized to Sixth Amendment speedy trial cases, where this Court has held that the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right is triggered when an individual is arrested and held to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 467 U. S. 186</a></p><p> answer criminal charges.  <em>See United States v. Marion,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/307/case.html">404 U. S. 307</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/307/case.html#320">404 U. S. 320</a></span> (1971).  The en banc majority reasoned that just as such an arrest constitutes an "accusation" for Sixth Amendment speedy trial purposes, the administrative detention of an inmate for more than 90 days because of a pending felony investigation constitutes an "accusation" for Sixth Amendment right to counsel purposes. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Thus, according to the Court of Appeals\' holding, an indigent inmate isolated in administrative detention while the subject of a felony investigation must be afforded counsel after 90 days, or else be released back into the prison population, in order to ensure that he or his lawyer will be able to take preindictment investigatory steps to preserve his defense at trial.  704 F.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p>Applying its test to the facts of this case, the Court of Appeals majority held that each respondent had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  It concluded that the record showed that each respondent had been held in administrative detention longer than 90 days, that each had been held at least in part because of a pending felony investigation, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and that each had requested and had been denied counsel during his confinement in the ADU.  The majority went on to conclude that the appropriate remedy for redressing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 467 U. S. 187</a></p><p> the Sixth Amendment violations in this case was reversal of respondents\' convictions and dismissal of the indictments against them. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Five judges dissented from the en banc majority\'s Sixth Amendment holding.  Relying on <em>Kirby v. Illinois, supra,</em> the dissent concluded that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered by the initiation of formal criminal proceedings even in the prison context, and that the majority\'s conclusion to the contrary shows a misunderstanding of the purpose of the counsel guarantee.  704 F.2d at 1127-1129.  We agree with the dissenting judges\' application of our precedents to this situation, and, accordingly, we reverse the en banc majority\'s holding that respondents had a Sixth Amendment right to the appointment of counsel during their preindictment segregation.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."  As the Court of Appeals majority noted, our cases have long recognized that the right to counsel attaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the defendant.  In <em>Kirby v. Illinois, supra,</em> a plurality of the Court summarized our prior cases as follows:</p>\n<p>"In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court\'s landmark opinion in <em>Powell v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/287/45/case.html">287 U.

[W]hile members of the Court have differed as to the existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, <em>all</em> of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings -- whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#688">406 U.

We agree with the dissent that the majority\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 467 U. S. 190</a></p><p> analogy to Sixth Amendment speedy trial cases is inapt.  Our speedy trial cases hold that that Sixth Amendment right may attach before an indictment and as early as the time of "arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge,"  <em>United States v.

This difference is readily explainable, given the fact that the speedy trial right and the right to counsel protect different interests.  While the right to counsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor, the speedy trial right exists primarily to protect an individual\'s liberty interest,</p>\n<p>"to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

Thus, the majority\'s attempt to draw an analogy between an arrest and an inmate\'s administrative detention pending investigation may have some relevance in analyzing when the speedy trial right attaches in this context, but it is not relevant to a proper determination of when the right to counsel attaches.

S. 191</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' holding also confuses the purpose of the right to counsel with purposes that are served by the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee and the statutes of limitations applicable to the particular crime being investigated.  The majority concludes that the extension of the right to counsel to this prison context is necessary to protect against the possibility that the Government may delay the initiation of formal charges, thus delaying the appointment of counsel, while it develops its case against the isolated and unaided inmate.  704 F.2d at 1122.  By the time the Government decides to bring charges, the majority felt, witnesses\' memories could have dimmed, alibi witnesses could have been transferred to other facilities, and physical evidence could have deteriorated.  <em>Id.</em> at 1126.</p>\n<p>Those concerns, while certainly legitimate ones, are simply not concerns implicating the right to counsel, and we reaffirm that the mere</p>\n<p>"possibility of prejudice [to a defendant resulting from the passage of time] . . . is not itself sufficient reason to wrench the Sixth Amendment from its proper context."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Marion, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/307/case.html#321">404 U. S. 321</a></span>-322.  In holding that the appointment of counsel or the release of the inmate from segregation could remedy its concerns, the Court of Appeals must have concluded, quite illogically, we believe, that the presence of the inmate in the general prison population or the appointment of a lawyer could somehow prevent the deterioration of physical evidence, or that the inmate or his counsel could begin an effective investigation of the crime within the restricted prison walls before even being able to discover the nature of the Government\'s case.  Of course, both inside and outside the prison, it may well be true that, in some cases, preindictment investigation could help a defendant prepare a better defense.  But, as we have noted, our cases have never suggested that the purpose of the right to counsel is to provide a defendant with a preindictment private investigator, and we see no reason to adopt that novel interpretation of the right to counsel in this case. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 467 U. S. 192</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, at bottom, the majority\'s concern is that, because an inmate suspected of a crime is already in prison, the prosecution may have little incentive promptly to bring formal charges against him, and that the resulting preindictment delay may be particularly prejudicial to the inmate, given the problems inherent in investigating prison crimes, such as the transient nature of the prison population and the general reluctance of inmates to cooperate.  But applicable statutes of limitations protect against the prosecution\'s bringing stale criminal charges against any defendant, <em>United States v. Lovasco, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/783/case.html#788">431 U. S. 788</a></span>-789; <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  After hearings, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 467 U. S. 198</a></p><p> prison administrators had concluded that respondents likely had murdered fellow inmates.  Under such circumstances, there can be no doubt that concern for the welfare of other inmates or respondents themselves fully justified administrative detention entirely apart from its relation to an ongoing criminal investigation.  <em>See Hewitt v. Helms,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html">459 U. S. 460</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#473">459 U. S. 473</a></span>-476 (1983).  Indeed, there is no finding in either of these consolidated cases that respondents were placed in the ADU at the behest of prosecutorial authorities or in order to aid prosecutorial efforts, nor is there a finding that their detention facilitated the investigation of the two murders at issue. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  On this record, there is no reason to believe that the segregation of suspected murderers from the general prison population either was intended to or had the effect of facilitating a criminal investigation, rather than simply serving legitimate institutional policies.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, while I find no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, to the extent that the Court purports to formulate a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 467 U.

The fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a \'stage when legal aid and advice\' are surely needed.  The right to counsel would indeed be hollow if it began at a period when few confessions were obtained.  There is necessarily a direct relationship between the importance of a stage to the police in their quest for a confession and the criticalness of that stage to the accused in his need for legal advice.  Our Constitution, unlike some others, strikes the balance in favor the right of the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self-incrimination."</p>\n<p>378 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html#488">378 U.

As the quotation <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/case.html#193">467 U. S. 193</a></span>, demonstrates, <em>Brewer v.

Assuming that construction is correct, the fact that respondents\' detention after that point was not disciplinary does not mean it was therefore accusatory.  To the contrary, the applicable regulation states:</p>\n<p>"Administrative detention is to be used only for short periods of time except where an inmate needs long-term protection . . . or where there are exceptional circumstances, ordinarily tied to <em>security</em> or complex investigative concerns."</p>\n<p>28 CFR \xc2\xa7 541.22(c)(1) (1983) (emphasis supplied).  Thus, the regulation permits continued detention for security reasons alone.

The only factual predicate to this conclusion, indeed the only fact the District Court found with respect to the purpose and effect of respondents\' segregation, was that the Bureau of Prisons\' usual policies</p>\n<p>"would have required the [respondent]s\' release back into the general prison population or their transfer to a more secure facility within the first few months after their ADU commitment,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 43a.

S. 193</a></span>-197, we have recognized that, in certain situations, an individual\'s right to counsel is triggered before the formal initiation of adversary judicial proceedings.  <em>See, e.g., Escobedo v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html">378 U.

This recognition has stemmed from an appreciation that the government can transform an individual into an "accused" without officially designating him as such through the ritual of arraignment.  Moreover, I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that the government treats an individual as an accused when that individual</p>\n<p>"is deprived of liberty in order to aid the prosecution in its attempt to convict him, and when the deprivation is likely to have the intended effect. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/case.html#197">467 U. S. 197</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Unlike JUSTICE STEVENS, however, I reject the judgment as well as the reasoning of the Court.  JUSTICE STEVENS concurs in the judgment of the Court because, in his view, the transfer of respondents from the general prison population to the far harsher constraints of administrative detention [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] did not in any way serve "an accusatorial function," but served instead to further the security interests of the correctional institution and the welfare of respondents themselves.  <em>Ibid.</em>  My reading of the record and of the factfinding of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 467 U. S. 200</a></p><p> the courts below leads me to a different conclusion.  With respect to respondents Mills and Pierce, the District Court stated, in the portion of its opinion entitled "Factual Background," that, by the time they were committed to administrative detention, "the finger of suspicion" had already been pointed at them.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a-46a.  This finding is corroborated by prison officials\' own notation that respondents were to be detained in administrative detention "pending investigation or trial for a criminal act," App. 138-139, and by the odd course of events that transpired after respondents\' detention:  the Government\'s delay in seeking indictments alongside the unusually long period during which respondents were confined to their cells.  <em>See</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a-47a.  The District Court was therefore justified in concluding that respondents\' "commitment to [administrative detention] was neither a form of prison discipline nor an attempt to ensure prison security," but was instead "part and parcel of a sequence of prosecutive acts integrally related to the application of criminal sanctions."  <em>Id.</em> at 47a-48a.  The District Court\'s findings and conclusion were noted and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  704 F.2d 1116, 1125 (1983).  This Court has repeatedly stated that it</p>\n<p>"\'cannot undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error.\'"</p>\n<p><em>See Berenyi v. District Director, INS,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/630/case.html">385 U. S. 630</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/630/case.html#635">385 U. S. 635</a></span> (1967), quoting <em>Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/271/case.html">336 U.

In this case, no such showing of error has been made.</p>\n<p>We do not have the benefit of a trial judge\'s explicit factual findings with respect to respondents Reynoso, Segura, Ramirez, and Gouveia.  However, we do have the Government\'s admission that one reason all of the respondents were kept in administrative detention was "because of the pendency of the criminal investigation. . . ."  Brief for United States 26.  This admission further supports the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that "each [respondent] was held in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 467 U. S. 201</a></p><p> [administrative detention] at least in part as a result of pending criminal charges."  704 F.2d at 1125.</p>\n<p>Because of their disposition of the Sixth Amendment issue, neither the majority nor JUSTICE STEVENS reaches the other issue posed by this case:  whether the Court of Appeals erred by dismissing the indictments against respondents.  The Government claims that dismissing the indictments was inconsistent with this Court\'s decision in <em>United States v. Morrison,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/361/case.html">449 U. S. 361</a></span> (1981).  In <em>Morrison,</em> we reversed the dismissal of an indictment in a case in which it was assumed, <em>arguendo,</em> that a Sixth Amendment violation had occurred and in which the defendant "demonstrated no prejudice of any kind . . . to the ability of her counsel to provide adequate representation. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/361/case.html#366">449 U. S. 366</a></span>.  We stated that, in right-to-counsel cases, dismissal of an indictment is inappropriate "absent demonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/361/case.html#365">449 U. S. 365</a></span>, because a presumption of prejudice would contravene</p>\n<p>"the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered . . . and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/361/case.html#364">449 U. S. 364</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that dismissal of respondents\' indictments was warranted under both the <em>Morrison</em> standard and a presumption-of-prejudice standard that it found to be appropriate to the facts of this case.  The Court of Appeals felt compelled to articulate an alternative to the <em>Morrison</em> standard because, in its view, this case was "fundamentally different" insofar as the right-to-counsel violation affected inmate-suspects held in administrative detention.  704 F.2d at 1126.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, in such a setting, a presumption of prejudice would be appropriate "because ordinarily it will be impossible adequately either to prove or refute its existence."  <em>Ibid.</em>  I disagree with the Court of Appeals; its own application of <em>Morrison</em> to the facts of this case demonstrates that, even in the context of a Sixth Amendment violation affecting prisoners, the usual process of case-specific inquiry will be adequate to determine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 467 U. S. 202</a></p><p> whether dismissal of an indictment is warranted.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, even without an assumption of prejudice, "there is evidence that <em>substantial prejudice\' may have occurred" in this case.  704 F.2d at 1126.  This conclusion satisfies the <em>Morrison</em> requirement that persons seeking dismissal of their indictments must show either "demonstrable prejudice, <em>or substantial threat thereof. . . .</em>"  449 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/361/case.html#365">449 U.
