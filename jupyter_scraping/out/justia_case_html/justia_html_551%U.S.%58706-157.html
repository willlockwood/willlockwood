FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x93157.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 28, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 25, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">The President, by executive orders, created a White House office and several centers within federal agencies to ensure that faith-based community groups are eligible to compete for federal financial support.  No congressional legislation specifically authorized these entities, which were created entirely within the Executive Branch, nor has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money to their activities, which are funded through general Executive Branch appropriations.  Respondents, an organization opposed to Government endorsement of religion and three of its members, brought this suit alleging that petitioners, the directors of the federal offices, violated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences that were designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups over secular ones.  The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers opposed to Executive Branch use of congressional appropriations for these conferences.  The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of standing, concluding that under <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a>, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment Clause challenges to the constitutionality of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.  Because petitioners acted on the President\xe2\x80\x99s behalf and were not charged with administering a congressional program, the court held that the challenged activities did not authorize taxpayer standing under <em>Flast</em>.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, reading <em>Flast </em>as granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are financed by a congressional appropriation, even where there is no statutory program and the funds are from appropriations for general administrative expenses.  According to the court, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency so long as the marginal or incremental cost to the public of the alleged Establishment Clause violation is greater than zero.    </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">433 F.\xc2\xa03d 989,  reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that because the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s broad reading of <em>Flast</em> is incorrect, respondents lack standing.

A controlling factor in the definition of such a case or controversy is standing, <em>ASARCO Inc.</em> v. <em>Kadish</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/605/index.html">490 U. S. 605</a>, 613, the requisite elements of which are well established: \xe2\x80\x9cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon</em>, decided with<em> Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U.

The taxpayer-plaintiff there alleged that the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under a federal statute violated the Establishment Clause.  The Court set out a two-part test for determining standing: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, \xe2\x80\xa6 a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Secondly, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  The Court then held that the particular taxpayer had satisfied both prongs of the test.  <em>Id.</em>, at 103\xe2\x80\x93104.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 broad reading of the <em>Flast </em>exception to cover any expenditure of Government funds in violation of the Establishment Clause fails to observe \xe2\x80\x9cthe rigor with which the <em>Flast</em> exception to the <em>Frothingham</em> principle ought to be applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Valley Forge Christian College</em> v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/464/index.html">454 U. S. 464</a>, 481.  Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in <em>Flast </em>was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite \xe2\x80\x9clogical link between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 102.  \xe2\x80\x9cTheir constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, to spend for the general welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 103.  But <em>Flast </em>\xe2\x80\x9climited taxpayer standing to challenges directed \xe2\x80\x98only [at] exercises of congressional power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  <em>Valley Forge, supra</em>, at 479.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05.\xc2\xa0The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <em>Flast </em>is missing here.  Respondents neither challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation nor ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional.  That is because the expenditures at issue were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress, but under general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund day-to-day activities.  These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures in question, which resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.  The Court has never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 619\xe2\x80\x93620, distinguished.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa06.\xc2\xa0Respondents argue to no avail that distinguishing between money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of executive discretion is arbitrary because the injury to taxpayers in both situations is the same as that targeted by the Establishment Clause and <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x94the expenditure for the support of religion of funds exacted from taxpayers.  But <em>Flast</em> focused on congressional action, and the invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures must be declined.  The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the <em>Flast</em> exception has a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow application,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___, that only \xe2\x80\x9cslightly lowered\xe2\x80\x9d the bar on taxpayer standing, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/index.html">418 U. S. 166</a>, 173, and that must be applied with \xe2\x80\x9crigor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Valley Forge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 481.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0Also rejected is respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that Executive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extractions.  <em>Flast </em>itself rejected this equivalence.  392 U. S., at 102.   Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the <em>Flast </em>exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action\xe2\x80\x94be it a conference, proclamation, or speech\xe2\x80\x94to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed rule would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns, enlisting the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9321. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa08.\xc2\xa0Both the Seventh Circuit and respondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but neither has identified a workable limitation.  Taking the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s zero-marginal-cost test literally\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that any marginal cost greater than zero suffices\xe2\x80\x94taxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches by Government officials.  At a minimum, that approach would create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to require an expenditure to be fairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause, so that challenges to the content of any particular speech would be screened out, is too vague and ill-defined to be accepted.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa09.\xc2\xa0None of the parade of horribles respondents claim could occur if <em>Flast</em> is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures has happened.  In the unlikely event any do take place, Congress can quickly step in.  And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs possessed of standing based on grounds other than their taxpayer status.  Pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa010.\xc2\xa0This case does not require the Court to reconsider <em>Flast</em>.  The Seventh Circuit did not apply <em>Flast</em>; it extended it.  <em>Valley Forge Christian Academy</em> illustrates that a necessary concomitant of <em>stare decisis</em> is that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.  That is the approach taken here.  <em>Flast</em> is neither extended nor overruled.  It is simply left as it was.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, concluding that <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a>, should be overruled as wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that are embodied in the standing doctrine.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously inconsistent because they have inconsistently described the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III requires.  Some cases have focused on the financial effect on the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s wallet, whereas <em>Flast</em> and the cases that follow its teaching have emphasized the mental displeasure the taxpayer suffers when his funds are extracted and spent in aid of religion.  There are only two logical routes available with respect to taxpayer standing.  If the mental displeasure created by Establishment Clause violations is concrete and particularized enough to constitute an Article III \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d then <em>Flast</em> should be applied to (at a minimum) <em>all</em> challenges to government expenditures allegedly violating constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if not, <em>Flast</em> should be overturned.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality avails itself of neither principled option, instead accepting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s submission that <em>Flast</em> should be limited to challenges to expenditures that are expressly authorized or mandated by specific congressional enactment.  However, the plurality gives no explanation as to why the factual differences between this case and <em>Flast </em>are material.  (Whether the challenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment is not relevant to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.)  Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that <em>Flast</em> erred by relying on purely mental injury.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 legal position is no more coherent than the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s.  They refuse to admit that their argument logically implies that <em>every</em> expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to suit under <em>Flast</em>.  Of course, <em>that</em> position finds no support in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents or this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.  A\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s purely psychological disapproval that his funds are being spent in an allegedly unlawful manner is never sufficiently concrete and particularized to support Article III standing.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  Although overruling precedents is a serious undertaking, <em>stare decisis</em> should not prevent the Court from doing so here.  <em>Flast</em> was inconsistent with the cases that came before it and undervalued the separation-of-powers function of standing.  Its lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered the Court\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayer-standing doctrine so incomprehensible that appellate judges do not know what to make of it.  The case has engendered no reliance interests.  Few cases less warrant <em>stare decisis</em> effect.

The plaintiffs contend that they meet the standing requirements of Article III of the Constitution because they pay federal taxes.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It has long been established, however, that the payment of taxes is generally not enough to establish standing to challenge an action taken by the Federal Government.  In light of the size of the federal budget, it is a complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional federal expenditure causes an individual federal taxpayer any measurable economic harm.  And if every federal taxpayer could sue to challenge any Government expenditure, the federal courts would cease to function as courts of law and would be cast in the role of general complaint bureaus.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968), we recognized a narrow exception to the general rule against federal taxpayer standing. Under <em>Flast</em>, a plaintiff asserting an Establishment Clause claim has standing to challenge a law authorizing the use of federal funds in a way that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause.  In the present case, Congress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds to pay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged.  Instead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general Executive Branch appropriations.   \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, however, held that the plaintiffs have standing as taxpayers because the conferences were paid for with money appropriated by Congress.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question that is presented here is whether this broad reading of <em>Flast</em> is correct.

As we held over 80 years ago, in another case involving the question of taxpayer standing:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no power <em>per se</em> to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional.  The question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The party who invokes the power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon</em>, decided with<em> Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html"></a><a href="/us/262/447/index.html">262 U.

Of course, a taxpayer has standing to challenge the <em>collection</em> of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional; being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate economic injury to the individual taxpayer.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Follett</em> v. <em>Town of McCormick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/573/index.html">321 U. S. 573</a> (1944) (invalidating tax on preaching on First Amendment grounds).  But that is not the interest on which respondents assert standing here.  Rather, their claim is that, having paid lawfully collected taxes into the Federal Treasury at some point, they have a continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds are not <em>used</em> by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have consistently held that this type of interest is too generalized and attenuated to support Article III standing.  In <em>Frothingham</em>, a federal taxpayer sought to challenge federal appropriations for mothers\xe2\x80\x99 and children\xe2\x80\x99s health, arguing that federal involvement in this area intruded on the rights reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment and would \xe2\x80\x9cincrease the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] property without due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  262 U.

The taxpayer-plaintiff in that case challenged the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that such aid violated the Establishment Clause.  The Court set out a two-part test for determining whether a federal taxpayer has standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional expenditure:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.  Thus, a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, of the Constitution.  It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.  Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flast</em>, 392 U.

The plaintiff in that case challenged disbursements made under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27.  That Act expressly appropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal year 1966, \xc2\xa7201(b), <em>id.</em>, at 36, and authorized the disbursement of those funds to local educational agencies for the education of low-income students, see <em>Flast</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 86.

But as this Court later noted, <em>Flast </em>\xe2\x80\x9c limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed \xe2\x80\x98only [at] exercises of congressional power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  <em>Valley Forge</em>, 454 U.

Respondents do not challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation; nor do they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional.  That is because the expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress.  Rather, Congress provided general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures of which respondents complain.  Those expenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.  In <em>Valley Forge</em>, we held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge \xe2\x80\x9ca decision by [the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare] to transfer a parcel of federal property\xe2\x80\x9d to a religious college because this transfer was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a congressional action.\xe2\x80\x9d 454 U.

In fact, the connection to congressional action was closer in <em>Valley Forge</em> than it is here, because in that case, the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular Executive Branch action\xe2\x80\x9d being challenged was at least \xe2\x80\x9carguably authorized\xe2\x80\x9d by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which permitted federal agencies to transfer surplus property to private entities.  <em>Id.</em>, at 479, n.\xc2\xa015.  Nevertheless, we found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because <em>Flast</em> \xe2\x80\x9climited taxpayer standing to challenges directed \xe2\x80\x98only [at] exercises of congressional power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  454 U.

Characterizing this case as an \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied challenge\xe2\x80\x9d to these general appropriations statutes would stretch the meaning of that term past its breaking point.  It cannot be that every legal challenge to a discretionary Executive Branch action implicates the constitutionality of the underlying congressional appropriation.  When a criminal defendant charges that a federal agent carried out an unreasonable search or seizure, we do not view that claim as an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the statute appropriating funds for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Moreover, we have repeatedly emphasized that the <em>Flast</em> exception has a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow application in our precedent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cuno</em>, 547 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12), that only \xe2\x80\x9cslightly lowered\xe2\x80\x9d the bar on taxpayer standing, <em>Richardson</em>, 418 U.

We have declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause.  See <em>Tilton</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/index.html">403 U.

We have similarly refused to extend <em>Flast</em> to permit taxpayer standing for Establishment Clause challenges that do not implicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 taxing and spending power.  See <em>Valley Forge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 479\xe2\x80\x93482 (no taxpayer standing to challenge Executive Branch action taken pursuant to Property Clause of Art.\xc2\xa0IV); see also <em>District of Columbia Common Cause </em>v. <em>District of Columbia</em>, 858 F.\xc2\xa02d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (CADC 1988); <em>In\xc2\xa0re United States Catholic Conference</em>, 885 F.\xc2\xa02d 1020, 1028 (CA2 1989).  In effect, we have adopted the position set forth by Justice Powell in his concurrence in <em>Richardson</em> and have \xe2\x80\x9climit[ed] the expansion of federal taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the <em>results</em> in <em>Flast</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U.

S., at 102.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the <em>Flast </em>exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action\xe2\x80\x94be it a conference, proclamation or speech\xe2\x80\x94to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.  To see the wide swathe of activity that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed rule would cover, one need look no further than the amended complaint in this action, which focuses largely on speeches and presentations made by Executive Branch officials.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Amended Complaint \xc2\xb632, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch officials\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csupport of national and regional conferences\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb633, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a\xe2\x80\x9375a (challenging content of speech by Secretary of Education); <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb635, 36, App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a (challenging content of Presidential speeches); <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb641, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (challenging Executive Branch officials\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpublic appearances\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspeeches\xe2\x80\x9d).  Such a broad reading would ignore the first prong of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s standing test, which requires \xe2\x80\x9ca logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 102.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns.   As we have recognized, <em>Flast </em>itself gave too little weight to these concerns.  By framing the standing question solely in terms of whether the dispute would be presented in an adversary context and in a form traditionally viewed as capable of judicial resolution, <em>Flast</em> \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to recognize that this doctrine has a separation-of-powers component, which keeps courts within certain traditional bounds vis-\xc3\x80-vis the other branches, concrete adverseness or not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U.

The rule respondents propose would enlist the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials.

The Court of Appeals, as noted, conceded only that a taxpayer would lack standing where \xe2\x80\x9cthe marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9czero.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 995.  Applying this rule, the Court of Appeals opined that a taxpayer would not have standing to challenge a President\xe2\x80\x99s favorable reference to religion in a State of the Union address because the costs associated with the speech \xe2\x80\x9cwould be no greater merely because the President had mentioned Moses rather than John Stuart Mill.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is reason to question whether the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 intended for its zero-marginal-cost test to be taken literally, because the court, without any apparent inquiry into the costs of Secretary Paige\xe2\x80\x99s speech, went on to agree that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge that speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 996.  But if we take the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 test literally\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that any marginal cost greater than zero suffices\xe2\x80\x94taxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches.  As Judge Easterbrook observed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe total cost of presidential proclamations and speeches by Cabinet officers that touch on religion (Thanksgiving and several other holidays) surely exceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that much to use Air Force One and send a Secret Service detail to a single speaking engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d  447 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 989\xe2\x80\x93990 (concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  At a minimum, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach (asking whether the marginal cost exceeded zero) would surely create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems.  Suppose that it is alleged that a speech writer or other staff member spent extra time doing research for the purpose of including \xe2\x80\x9creligious imagery\xe2\x80\x9d in a speech.  Suppose that a President or a Cabinet officer attends or speaks at a prayer breakfast and that the time spent was time that would have otherwise been spent on secular work.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents take a somewhat different approach, contending that their proposed expansion of <em>Flast </em>would be manageable because they would require that a challenged expenditure be \xe2\x80\x9cfairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 17.  Applying this test, they argue, would \xe2\x80\x9cscree[n] out \xe2\x80\xa6 challenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for example the State of the Union address, as an Establishment Clause violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find little comfort in this vague and ill-defined test.  As an initial matter, respondents fail to explain why the (often substantial) costs that attend, for example, a Presidential address are any less \xe2\x80\x9ctraceable\xe2\x80\x9d than the expenses related to the Executive Branch statements and conferences at issue here.  Indeed, respondents concede that even lawsuits involving <em>de minimis </em>amounts of taxpayer money can pass their proposed \xe2\x80\x9ctraceability\xe2\x80\x9d test.  <em>Id.</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9ctraceability\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, depending on how it is framed, would appear to prove either too little or too much.  If the question is whether an allegedly unconstitutional executive action can somehow be traced to taxpayer funds <em>in general</em>, the answer will always be yes: Almost all Executive Branch activities are ultimately funded by <em>some </em>congressional appropriation, whether general or specific, which is in turn financed by tax receipts.  If, on the other hand, the question is whether the challenged action can be traced to the contributions of a <em>particular</em> taxpayer-plaintiff, the answer will almost always be no: As we recognized in <em>Frothingham</em>, the interest of any individual taxpayer in a particular federal expenditure \xe2\x80\x9cis comparatively minute and indeterminable \xe2\x80\xa6 and constantly changing.\xe2\x80\x9d  262 U. S., at 487.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they claim could occur if <em>Flast</em> is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures.  For example, they say, a federal agency could use its discretionary funds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and send them out to spread their faith.  Or an agency  could use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent  for use in its offices or for distribution to the employees or the general public.  Of course, none of these things has happened, even though <em>Flast</em> has not previously been expanded in the way that respondents urge.  In the unlikely event that any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly step in.  And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0C</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, <em>Flast</em> has been defended by some and criticized by others.  But the present case does not require us to reconsider that precedent.  The Court of Appeals did not apply <em>Flast</em>; it extended <em>Flast</em>.  It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.  That was the approach that then-Justice Rehnquist took in his opinion for the Court in <em>Valley Forge</em>, and it is the approach we take here.  We do not extend <em>Flast</em>, but we also do not overrule it.  We leave <em>Flast</em> as we found it.    </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia says that we must either overrule <em>Flast</em> or extend it to the limits of its logic. His position is not \xe2\x80\x9c[in]sane,\xe2\x80\x9d inconsistent with the \xe2\x80\x9crule of law,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cutterly meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).  But it is wrong.  Justice Scalia does not seriously dispute either (1) that <em>Flast </em>itself spoke in terms of \xe2\x80\x9clegislative enactment[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexercises of congressional power,\xe2\x80\x9d 392 U.

We need go no further to decide this case.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 559\xe2\x80\x93560 (1992).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968), and in later cases applying it, must be interpreted as respecting separation-of-powers principles but acknowledging as well that these principles, in some cases, must accommodate the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause.  The clause expresses the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s special concern that freedom of conscience not be compromised by government taxing and spending in support of religion.  In my view the result reached in <em>Flast </em>is correct and should not be called into question.  For the reasons set forth by Justice Alito, however, <em>Flast</em> should not be extended to permit taxpayer standing in the instant matter.  And I join his opinion in full. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 amended complaint challenged the religious nature of national and regional conferences that promoted President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a\xe2\x80\x9377a.  To support the allegation respondents pointed to speeches given by the President and other executive officers, speeches with religious references.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73a\xe2\x80\x9376a.  The complaint relies on respondents\xe2\x80\x99 taxpayer status as the sole basis for standing to maintain the suit but points to no specific use of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 taxing and spending power other than general appropriations to fund the administration of the Executive Branch.  <em>Id.,</em> at 71a\xe2\x80\x9373a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Flast</em> established a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the rule against taxpayer standing.  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 618 (1988).  To find standing in the circumstances of this case would make the narrow exception boundless.  The public events and public speeches respondents seek to call in question are part of the open discussion essential to democratic self-government.  The Executive Branch should be free, as a general matter, to discover new ideas, to understand pressing public demands, and to find creative responses to address governmental concerns.  The exchange of ideas between and among the State and Federal Governments and their manifold, diverse constituencies sustains a free society.  Permitting any and all taxpayers to challenge the content of these prototypical executive operations and dialogues would lead to judicial intervention so far exceeding traditional boundaries on the Judiciary that there would arise a real danger of judicial oversight of executive duties.  The burden of discovery to ascertain if relief is justified in these potentially innumerable cases would risk altering the free exchange of ideas and information.  And were this constant supervision to take place the courts would soon assume the role of speech editors for communications issued by executive officials and event planners for meetings they hold.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The courts must be reluctant to expand their authority by requiring intrusive and unremitting judicial management of the way the Executive Branch performs its duties.  The Court has refused to establish a constitutional rule that would require or allow \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Garcetti</em> v. <em>Ceballos</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 11); see also <em>Cheney</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D. C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/367/index.html">542 U.

In the Article III context the Court explained that concerns based on separation of powers \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel[ed] against recognizing standing in a case brought \xe2\x80\xa6 to seek a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U.

The Court should not authorize the constant intrusion upon the executive realm that would result from granting taxpayer standing in the instant case.  As Justice Alito explains in detail, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents do not require it to do so.  The separation-of-powers concerns implicated by intrusive judicial regulation of day-to-day executive operations reinforce his interpretation of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s framework. Cf. <em>Allen</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 761, n. 26 (relying \xe2\x80\x9con separation of powers principles to interpret the \xe2\x80\x98fairly traceable\xe2\x80\x99 component of the standing requirement\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be remembered that, even where parties have no standing to sue, members of the Legislative and Executive Branches are not excused from making constitutional determinations in the regular course of their duties.

Unfortunately, the consistency lies in the creation of utterly meaningless distinctions which separate the case at hand from the precedents that have come out differently, but which cannot possibly be (in any sane world) the reason it comes out differently.  If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) <em>all</em> challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or <em>Flast</em> should be repudiated.  For me, the choice is easy.  <em>Flast</em> is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is a simple reason why our taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously inconsistent: We have inconsistently described the first element of the \xe2\x80\x9cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\xe2\x80\x9d which minimum consists of (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete and particularized\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98injury in fact\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that is (2) fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged unlawful conduct and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  See <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/555/index.html">504 U. S. 555</a>, 560\xe2\x80\x93561 (1992).  We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience I will call \xe2\x80\x9cWallet Injury\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPsychic Injury.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wallet Injury is the type of concrete and particularized injury one would expect to be asserted in a <em>taxpayer</em> suit, namely, a claim that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability is higher than it would be, but for the allegedly unlawful government action.  The stumbling block for suits challenging government expenditures based on this conventional type of injury is quite predictable.  The plaintiff cannot satisfy the traceability and redressability prongs of standing.  It is uncertain what the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax bill would have been had the allegedly forbidden expenditure not been made, and it is even more speculative whether the government will, in response to an adverse court decision, lower taxes rather than spend the funds in some other manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Psychic Injury, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability.  Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mental displeasure</em> that money extracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner.  This shift in focus eliminates traceability and redressability problems.  Psychic Injury is directly traceable to the improper <em>use</em> of taxpayer funds, and it is redressed when the improper use is enjoined, regardless of whether that injunction affects the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s purse.  <em>Flast</em> and the cases following its teaching have invoked a peculiarly restricted version of Psychic Injury, permitting taxpayer displeasure over unconstitutional spending to support standing <em>only if</em> the constitutional provision allegedly violated is a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power.  Restricted or not, this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated.  As we reaffirmed unanimously just this Term: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government\xe2\x80\x94claiming only harm to his and every citizen\xe2\x80\x99s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large\xe2\x80\x94does not state an Article III case or controversy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lance</em> v. <em>Coffman</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) <em>(per curiam) </em>(slip op., at 3) (quoting <em>Lujan</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 573\xe2\x80\x93574).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the following review of our cases demonstrates, we initially denied taxpayer standing based on Wallet Injury, but then found standing in some later cases based on the limited version of Psychic Injury described above.  The basic logical flaw in our cases is thus twofold: We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two pre-<em>Flast</em> cases are of critical importance.  In <em>Frothingham</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, decided with <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/447/index.html">262 U. S. 447</a> (1923), the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of the Maternity Act of 1921, alleging in part that the federal funding provided by the Act was not authorized by any provision of the Constitution.  See <em>id.</em>, at 476\xe2\x80\x93477 (argument for Frothingham), 479\xe2\x80\x93480 (opinion of the Court).  The Court held that the taxpayer lacked standing.  After emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect upon future taxation \xe2\x80\xa6 of any payment out of [Treasury] funds\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cremote, fluctuating and uncertain,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Frothingham</em>, 262 U. S., at 487, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he party who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 488.  The Court was thus describing the traceability and redressability problems with Wallet Injury, and rejecting Psychic Injury as a generalized grievance rather than concrete and particularized harm.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second significant pre-<em>Flast</em> case is <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a> (1952).  There the taxpayers challenged under the Establishment Clause a state law requiring public-school teachers to read the Bible at the beginning of each school day.  <em>Id.</em>, at 430, 433.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Relying extensively on <em>Frothingham</em>, the Court denied standing.  After first emphasizing that there was no allegation that the Bible reading increased the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 taxes or the cost of running the schools, 342 U. S., at 433, and then reaffirming that taxpayers must allege more than an indefinite injury suffered in common with people generally, <em>id.</em>, at 434, the Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cgrievance which [the plaintiffs] sought to litigate here is not a direct dollars-and-cents injury but is a religious difference,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  In addition to reiterating <em>Frothingham</em>\xe2\x80\x99s description of the unavoidable obstacles to recovery under a taxpayer theory of Wallet Injury, <em>Doremus</em> rejected Psychic Injury in unmistakable terms.  The opinion\xe2\x80\x99s deprecation of a mere \xe2\x80\x9creligious difference,\xe2\x80\x9d in contrast to a real \xe2\x80\x9cdollars-and-cents injury,\xe2\x80\x9d can only be understood as a flat denial of standing supported only by taxpayer disapproval of the unconstitutional use of tax funds.  If the Court had thought that Psychic Injury was a permissible basis for standing, it should have sufficed (as the dissenting Justices in <em>Doremus</em> suggested, see 342 U. S., at 435 (opinion of Douglas, J.)) that public employees were being paid in part to violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sixteen years after <em>Doremus</em>, the Court took a pivotal turn.  In <em>Flast</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/83/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/83/index.html">392 U. S. 83</a> (1968), taxpayers challenged the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, alleging that funds expended pursuant to the Act were being used to support parochial schools.  <em>Id.</em>, at 85\xe2\x80\x9387.  They argued that either the Act itself proscribed such expenditures or that the Act violated the Establishment Clause.  <em>Id.</em>, at 87, 90.  The Court held that the taxpayers had standing.  Purportedly in order to determine whether taxpayers have the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal stake and interest\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to satisfy Article III, a two-pronged nexus test was invented.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101\xe2\x80\x93102.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first prong required the taxpayer to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 102.  The Court described what that meant as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, of the Constitution.  It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute.  This requirement is consistent with the limitation imposed upon state-taxpayer standing in federal courts in <em>Doremus </em>\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe second prong required the taxpayer to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a nexus between [taxpayer] status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court elaborated that this required \xe2\x80\x9cthe taxpayer [to] show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  The Court held that the Establishment Clause was the type of specific limitation on the taxing and spending power that it had in mind because \xe2\x80\x9cone of the specific evils feared by\xe2\x80\x9d the Framers of that Clause was that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion generally.  <em>Id.</em>, at 103\xe2\x80\x93104 (relying exclusively upon Madison\xe2\x80\x99s famous Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because both prongs of its newly minted two-part test were satisfied, <em>Flast</em> held that the taxpayers had standing.  Wallet Injury could not possibly have been the basis for this conclusion, since the taxpayers in <em>Flast </em>were no more able to prove that success on the merits would reduce their tax burden than was the taxpayer in <em>Frothingham</em>.  Thus, <em>Flast</em> relied on Psychic Injury to support standing, describing the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d as the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that \xe2\x80\x9chis tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of legislative power.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U. S., at 106.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But that created a problem: If the taxpayers in <em>Flast</em> had standing based on Psychic Injury, and without regard to the effect of the litigation on their ultimate tax liability, why did not the taxpayers in <em>Doremus</em> and <em>Frothingham</em> have standing on a similar basis?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Enter the magical two-pronged nexus test.  It has often been pointed out, and never refuted, that the criteria in <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-part test are <em>entirely unrelated</em> to the purported goal of ensuring that the plaintiff has a sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cstake in the outcome of the controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Flast</em>, 392 U. S., at 121\xe2\x80\x93124 (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also <em>id.</em>, at 107 (Douglas, J., concurring); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/166/index.html"></a><a href="/us/418/166/index.html">418 U. S. 166</a>, 183 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring).  In truth, the test was designed for a quite different goal.  Each prong was meant to disqualify from standing one of the two prior cases that would otherwise contradict the holding of <em>Flast.  </em>The first prong distinguished <em>Doremus</em> as involving a challenge to an \xe2\x80\x9cincidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a challenge to a taxing and spending statute.  See 392 U. S., at 102.  Did the Court proffer any reason why a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s Psychic Injury is less concrete and particularized, traceable, or redressable when the challenged expenditures are incidental to an essentially regulatory statute (whatever that means)?  Not at all.  <em>Doremus</em> had to be evaded, and so it was.  In reality, of course, there is simply no material difference between <em>Flast</em> and <em>Doremus</em> as far as Psychic Injury is concerned: If taxpayers upset with the government\xe2\x80\x99s giving money to parochial schools had standing to sue, so should the taxpayers who disapproved of the government\xe2\x80\x99s paying public-school teachers to read the Bible.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s dispatching of <em>Frothingham</em> via the second prong of the nexus test was only marginally less disingenuous.  Not only does the relationship of the allegedly violated provision to the taxing and spending power have no bearing upon the concreteness or particularity of the Psychic Injury, see Part III, <em>infra</em>,<em> </em>but the existence of that relationship does not even genuinely distinguish <em>Flast </em>from <em>Frothingham.  </em>It is impossible to maintain that the Establishment Clause is a more direct limitation on the taxing and spending power than the constitutional limitation invoked in <em>Frothingham</em>, <em>which is contained within the very provision creating the power to tax and spend</em>.  Article I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01, provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence <em>and general Welfare</em> of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Though unmentioned in <em>Flast</em>, it was precisely this limitation upon the permissible purposes of taxing and spending upon which Mrs. Frothingham relied.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Appellant in <em>Frothingham, </em>O.\xc2\xa0T. 1922, No. 962, p.\xc2\xa068 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he words \xe2\x80\x98provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 are used <em>as limitations on the taxing power</em>\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9381 (discussing the general welfare limitation at length).</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Coherence and candor have fared no better in our later taxpayer-standing cases.

S. 464</a> (1982).  The taxpayers there challenged the decision of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to give a 77-acre tract of Government property, worth over half a million dollars, to a religious organization.  <em>Id.</em>, at 468.  The Court, adhering to the strict letter of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-pronged nexus test, held that the taxpayers lacked standing.  <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first prong was not satisfied: Rather than challenging a congressional taxing and spending statute, the plaintiffs were attacking an agency decision to transfer federal property pursuant to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under the Property Clause, Art.

Like the dissenters in <em>Valley Forge</em>, see 454 U. S., at 511\xe2\x80\x93512 (opinion of Brennan, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 513\xe2\x80\x93514 (opinion of Stevens, J.), I cannot fathom why Article III standing should turn on whether the government enables a religious organization to obtain real estate by giving it a check drawn from general tax revenues or instead by buying the property itself and then transferring title.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While <em>Valley Forge</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application of the first prong to distinguish <em>Flast </em>was unpersuasive, the Court was at least not trying to hide the ball.  Its holding was forthrightly based on a resounding rejection of the very concept of Psychic Injury:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Plaintiffs] fail to identify any personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees.  That is not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art.\xc2\xa0III, even though the disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms.  It is evident that respondents are firmly committed to the constitutional principle of separation of church and State, but standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s interest or the fervor of his advocacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 U. S., at 485\xe2\x80\x93486 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nOf course, in keeping with what was to become the shameful tradition of our taxpayer-standing cases, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s candor about the inadequacy of Psychic Injury was combined with a notable silence as to why <em>Flast</em> itself was not doomed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A mere six years later, <em>Flast</em> was resuscitated in <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a> (1988).  The taxpayers there brought facial and as-applied Establishment Clause challenges to the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which was a congressional scheme that provided grants to public or nonprofit private organizations to combat premarital adolescent pregnancy and sex.  <em>Id.</em>, at 593.  The as-applied challenge focused on whether particular grantees selected by the Secretary of Health and Human Services were constitutionally permissible recipients.  <em>Id.</em>, at 620\xe2\x80\x93622.  The Solicitor General argued that, under <em>Valley Forge</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first prong, the taxpayers lacked standing for their as-applied claim because that claim was really a challenge to executive decisionmaking, not to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its taxing and spending power.  487 U. S., at 618\xe2\x80\x93619.  The Court rejected this contention, holding that the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied claim was still a challenge to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taxing and spending power even though disbursement of the funds authorized by Congress had been administered by the Secretary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 619.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Kendrick</em>, like <em>Flast</em> before it, was obviously based on Psychic Injury: The taxpayers could not possibly make, and did not attempt to make, the showing required for Wallet Injury.  But by relying on Psychic Injury, <em>Kendrick</em> perfectly revealed the incompatibility of that concept with the outcome in <em>Doremus</em>.  Just as <em>Kendrick</em> did not care whether the appropriated funds would have been spent anyway\xe2\x80\x94given to a different, permissible recipient\xe2\x80\x94so also <em>Doremus</em> should not have cared that the teachers would likely receive the same salary once their classroom activities were limited to secular conduct.  <em>Flast</em> and <em>Kendrick</em>\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Psychic Injury is fundamentally at odds with <em>Frothingham</em>, <em>Doremus</em>, and <em>Valley Forge</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Which brings me to the final case worthy of mention.  Last Term, in <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno</em>, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), we concisely confirmed that <em>Flast</em> was based on Psychic Injury.  The taxpayers in that case sought to rely on <em>Flast</em> to raise a Commerce Clause challenge to a state franchise tax credit.  547 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  In rejecting the analogy and denying standing, we described <em>Flast</em> as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court \xe2\x80\xa6 understood the \xe2\x80\x98injury\xe2\x80\x99 alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very \xe2\x80\x98extract[ion] and spen[ding]\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\x98tax money\xe2\x80\x99 in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff.  And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <em>that</em> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13) (citation omitted; some alterations in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhat <em>Cuno</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conceptualization of <em>Flast</em> reveals is that there are only two logical routes available to this Court.  We must initially decide whether Psychic Injury is consistent with Article III.  If it is, we should apply <em>Flast</em> to <em>all</em> challenges to government expenditures in violation of constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if it is not, we should overturn <em>Flast</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality today avails itself of neither principled option.  Instead, essentially accepting the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s primary submission, it limits <em>Flast</em> to challenges to expenditures that are \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly authorized or mandated by . . . specific congressional enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  It offers no intellectual justification for this limitation, except that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 24.  That is true enough, but since courts purport to be engaged in <em>reasoned </em>decisionmaking, it is <em>only </em>true when (1) the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s logic is seen to require narrowing or readjustment in light of relevant distinctions that the new fact situation brings to the fore; or (2) its logic is fundamentally flawed, and so deserves to be limited to the facts that begot it.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality claims neither of these justifications.  As to the first, the plurality offers no explanation of why the factual differences between this case and <em>Flast</em> are <em>material</em>.  It virtually admits that express congressional allocation <em>vel non </em>has nothing to do with whether the plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact that is fairly traceable and likely to be redressed.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  As the dissent correctly contends and I shall not belabor, see <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Souter, J.), <em>Flast</em> is <em>indistinguishable</em> from this case for purposes of Article III.  Whether the challenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment <em>has absolutely no relevance</em> to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that the logic of <em>Flast </em>(its Psychic Injury rationale) is simply wrong, and <em>for that reason </em>should not be extended to other cases.  Despite the lack of acknowledgment, however, that is the only plausible explanation for the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to whether the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguishing\xe2\x80\x9d fact is legally material, and for its determination to limit <em>Flast</em> to its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>resul[t]</em>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Why, then, pick a distinguishing fact that may breathe life into <em>Flast </em>in future cases, preserving the disreputable disarray of our Establishment Clause standing jurisprudence?  Why not hold that only taxpayers raising Establishment Clause challenges to expenditures pursuant to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 have standing?  That, I suppose, would be too obvious a repudiation of <em>Flast</em>, and thus an impediment to the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s pose of minimalism.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the express-allocation line has no mooring to our tripartite test for Article III standing, it invites demonstrably absurd results.  For example, the plurality would deny standing to a taxpayer challenging the President\xe2\x80\x99s disbursement to a religious organization of a discrete appropriation that Congress had not explicitly allocated to that purpose, even if everyone knew that Congress and the President had informally negotiated that the entire sum would be spent in that precise manner.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa07 (holding that nonstatutory earmarks are insufficient to satisfy the express-allocation requirement).  And taxpayers should lack standing to bring Establishment Clause challenges to the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s use of appropriated funds when those expenditures have the <em>added vice</em> of violating congressional restrictions.  If, for example, Congress instructs the President to disburse grants to hospitals that he deems worthy, and the President instead gives all of the money to the Catholic Church, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in <em>Flast</em> [would be] missing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Indeed, taking the plurality at its word, Congress could insulate the President from <em>all</em> <em>Flast</em>-based suits by codifying the truism that no appropriation can be spent by the Executive Branch in a manner that violates the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any last pretense of minimalism\xe2\x80\x94of adhering to prior law but merely declining to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x94is swept away by the fact that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding flatly contradicts <em>Kendrick</em>.  The whole point of the as-applied challenge in <em>Kendrick</em> was that the Secretary, not Congress, had <em>chosen</em> inappropriate grant recipients.  487 U. S., at 620\xe2\x80\x93622.  Both <em>Kendrick</em> and this case equally involve, in the relevant sense, attacks on executive discretion rather than congressional decision: Congress generally authorized the spending of tax funds for certain purposes but did not explicitly mandate that they be spent in the <em>unconstitutional </em>manner challenged by the taxpayers.  I thus share the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s bewilderment, see <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion of Souter, J.), as to why the plurality fixates on the amount of <em>additional</em> discretion the Executive Branch enjoys under the law beyond the only discretion relevant to the Establishment Clause issue: whether to spend taxpayer funds for a purpose that is unconstitutional.  See <em>ante</em>, at 25 (focusing on whether the case involves \xe2\x80\x9ca <em>purely</em> discretionary Executive Branch expenditure\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).      </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While I have been critical of the Members of the plurality, I by no means wish to give the impression that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 legal position is any more coherent.  Respondents argue that <em>Flast</em> did not turn on whether Congress has expressly allocated the funds to the allegedly unconstitutional use, and their case plainly rests on Psychic Injury.  They repeatedly emphasize that the injury in <em>Flast</em> was merely the governmental extraction and spending of tax money in aid of religion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondents 28.  Respondents refuse to admit that their argument logically implies, for the reasons already discussed, that <em>every</em> expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to suit under <em>Flast</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, such a concession would run headlong into the denial of standing in <em>Doremus</em>.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 only answer to <em>Doremus</em> is the cryptic assertion that the injury there was not fairly traceable to the unconstitutional conduct.  Brief for Respondents 21, and n.\xc2\xa07.  This makes no sense.  On <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s theory of Psychic Injury, the injury in <em>Doremus</em> was perfectly traceable and not in any way attenuated.  It consisted of the psychic frustration that tax funds were being used in violation of the Establishment Clause, which was directly caused by the paying of teachers to read the Bible, and which would have been remedied by prohibition of that expenditure.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The hollowness of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 traceability argument is perhaps best demonstrated by their counsel\xe2\x80\x99s game submission at oral argument that there would be standing to challenge the hiring of a single Secret Service agent who guarded the President during religious trips, but no standing if those responsibilities (and the corresponding taxpayer-funded compensation) were spread out over the entire Secret Service protective detail.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The logical consequence of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position finds no support in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents or our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  Any taxpayer would be able to sue whenever tax funds were used in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause.  So, for example, any taxpayer could challenge the fact that the Marshal of our Court is paid, in part, to call the courtroom to order by proclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cGod Save the United States and this Honorable Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  As much as respondents wish to deny that this is what <em>Flast</em> logically entails, it blinks reality to conclude otherwise.  If respondents are to prevail, they must endorse a future in which ideologically motivated taxpayers could \xe2\x80\x9croam the country in search of governmental wrongdoing and \xe2\x80\xa6 reveal their discoveries in federal court,\xe2\x80\x9d transforming those courts into \xe2\x80\x9combudsmen of the general welfare\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to Establishment Clause issues.  <em>Valley Forge</em>, 454 U. S., at 487.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the arguments by the parties in this case and the opinions of my colleagues serve only to confirm that <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of Psychic Injury has to be addressed head-on.  Minimalism is an admirable judicial trait, but not when it comes at the cost of meaningless and disingenuous distinctions that hold the sure promise of engendering further meaningless and disingenuous distinctions in the future.  The rule of law is ill served by forcing lawyers and judges to make arguments that deaden the soul of the law, which is logic and reason.  Either <em>Flast</em> was correct, and must be accorded the wide application that it logically dictates, or it was not, and must be abandoned in its entirety.

S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574.  As evidence of the consistency with which we have affirmed that understanding, <em>Lujan</em> relied on the reasoning in <em>Frothingham</em>, and in several other cases, including <em>Ex parte L\xc3\xa9vitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/633/index.html">302 U.

And it is of no conceivable relevance to this issue whether the Establishment Clause was originally conceived of as a specific limitation on the taxing and spending power.  Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Remonstrance has nothing whatever to say on the question whether suits alleging violations of that limitation are anything other than the generalized grievances that federal courts had always been barred from considering before <em>Flast</em>.  <em>Flast</em> was forced to rely on the slim reed of the Remonstrance since there was no better support for its novel conclusion, in 1968, that violation of the Establishment Clause, unique among the provisions of our law, had always inflicted a personalized Psychic Injury upon all taxpayers that federal courts had the power to remedy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, <em>Flast</em> is damaged goods, not only because its fanciful two-pronged \xe2\x80\x9cnexus\xe2\x80\x9d test has been demonstrated to be irrelevant to the test\xe2\x80\x99s supposed objective, but also because its cavalier treatment of the standing requirement rested upon a fundamental underestimation of that requirement\xe2\x80\x99s importance.  <em>Flast </em>was explicitly and erroneously premised on the idea that Article III standing does not perform a crucial separation-of-powers function:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe question whether a particular person is a proper party to maintain the action does not, by its own force, raise separation of powers problems related to improper judicial interference in areas committed to other branches of the Federal Government.  Such problems arise, if at all, only from the substantive issues the individual seeks to have adjudicated.  Thus, in terms of Article III limitations on federal court jurisdiction, the question of standing is related only to whether the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  392 U.

We twice have noted explicitly that <em>Flast</em> failed to recognize the vital separation-of-powers aspect of Article III standing.

And once a proper understanding of the relationship of standing to the separation of powers is brought to bear, Psychic Injury, even as limited in <em>Flast</em>, is revealed for what it is: a contradiction of the basic propositions that the function of the judicial power \xe2\x80\x9cis, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803), and that generalized grievances affecting the public at large have their remedy in the political process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Overruling prior precedents, even precedents as disreputable as <em>Flast</em>, is nevertheless a serious undertaking, and I understand the impulse to take a minimalist approach.  But laying just claim to be honoring <em>stare decisis</em> requires more than beating <em>Flast</em> to a pulp and then sending it out to the lower courts weakened, denigrated, more incomprehensible than ever, and yet somehow technically alive.  Even before the addition of the new meaningless distinction devised by today\xe2\x80\x99s plurality, taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases has been a game of chance.  In the proceedings below, well-respected federal judges declined to hear this case en banc, not because they thought the issue unimportant or the panel decision correct, but simply because they found our cases so lawless that there was no point in, quite literally, second-guessing the panel.  See <em>Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.</em> v. <em>Chao</em>, 447 F.\xc2\xa03d 988 (CA7 2006) (Flaum, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); <em>id.</em>, at 989\xe2\x80\x93990 (Easterbrook, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (describing our cases as \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cillogical,\xe2\x80\x9d and lacking in \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensiveness and rationality\xe2\x80\x9d).

But what experience has shown is that <em>Flast</em>\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered our taxpayer-standing doctrine such a jurisprudential disaster that our appellate judges do not know what to make of it.  And of course the case has engendered no reliance interests, not only because one does not arrange his affairs with an eye to standing, but also because there is no relying on the random and irrational.

S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 13) (quoting <em>Flast</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 106; alterations in original).  As the Court said in <em>Flast</em>, the importance of that type of injury has deep historical roots going back to the ideal of religious liberty in James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, that the government in a free society may not \xe2\x80\x9cforce a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment\xe2\x80\x9d of religion.  2 Writings of James Madison 183, 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901) (hereinafter Madison), quoted in <em>Flast</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103.  Madison thus translated into practical terms the right of conscience described when he wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Religion \xe2\x80\xa6 of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Madison 184; see also <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U. S. 639</a>, 711, n. 22 (2002) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a historical matter, the protection of liberty of conscience may well have been the central objective served by the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Locke</em> v. <em>Davey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/712/index.html">540 U. S. 712</a>, 722 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cSince the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an \xe2\x80\x98established\xe2\x80\x99 religion\xe2\x80\x9d); N.

The three pence implicates the conscience, and the injury from Government expenditures on religion is not accurately classified with the \xe2\x80\x9cPsychic Injury\xe2\x80\x9d that results whenever a congressional appropriation or executive expenditure raises hackles of disagreement with the policy supported, see <em>ante</em>, at 8 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Justice Stewart recognized this in his concurring opinion in <em>Flast</em>,<em> </em>when he said that \xe2\x80\x9cevery taxpayer can claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the support of a religious institution,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus distinguished the case from one in which a taxpayer sought only to air a generalized grievance in federal court.  392 U. S., at 114.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are  alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion.  Cf. <em>Doremus</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/429/index.html">342 U. S. 429</a>, 434 (1952).  The taxpayers therefore seek not to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flast</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 24 (plurality opinion), but merely to apply it.  When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury.  And once we recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably \xe2\x80\x9ctraceable\xe2\x80\x9d to the spending, and \xe2\x80\x9clikely to be redressed by\xe2\x80\x9d an injunction prohibiting it.  <em>Allen</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/index.html">468 U. S. 737</a>, 751 (1984); see also <em>Cuno</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n injunction against the spending would of course redress <em>that</em> injury\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality points to the separation of powers to explain its distinction between legislative and executive spending decisions, see <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, but there is no difference on that point of view between a Judicial Branch review of an executive decision and a judicial evaluation of a congressional one.  We owe respect to each of the other branches, no more to the former than to the latter, and no one has suggested that the Establishment Clause lacks applicability to executive uses of money.  It would surely violate the Establishment Clause for the Department of Health and Human Services to draw on a general appropriation to build a chapel for weekly church services (no less than if a statute required it), and for good reason: if the Executive could accomplish through the exercise of discretion exactly what Congress cannot do through legislation, Establishment Clause protection would melt away.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So in <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html"></a><a href="/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a> (1988), we recognized the equivalence between a challenge to a congressional spending bill and a claim that the Executive Branch was spending an appropriation, each in violation of the Establishment Clause.  We held that the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim that \xe2\x80\xa6 funds [were] being used improperly by individual grantees [was no] less a challenge to congressional taxing and spending power simply because the funding authorized by Congress has flowed through and been administered by the Secretary,\xe2\x80\x9d and we added that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise Establishment Clause challenges, even when their claims raised questions about the administratively made grants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 619.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality points out that the statute in <em>Bowen</em> \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grantmaking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  That is all true, but there is no reason to think it should matter, and every indication in <em>Bowen</em> that it did not.  In <em>Bowen</em> we already had found the statute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied challenge, see 487 U. S., at 618, so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause.  Thus, after <em>Bowen</em>, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between a \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional mandate\xe2\x80\x9d on the one hand and \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive discretion\xe2\x80\x9d on the other, <em>ante</em>, at 18, is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d so there is no line to be drawn between <em>Bowen</em> and the case before us today.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While <em>Flast </em>standing to assert the right of conscience is in a class by itself, it would be a mistake to think that case is unique in recognizing standing in a plaintiff without injury to flesh or purse.  Cognizable harm takes account of the nature of the interest protected, which is the reason that \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving it impossible \xe2\x80\x9cto make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allen</em>, 468 U.

The question, ultimately, has to be whether the injury alleged is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially cognizable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 752.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case of economic or physical harms, of course, the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury in fact\xe2\x80\x9d question is straightforward.  But once one strays from these obvious cases, the enquiry can turn subtle.  Are esthetic harms sufficient for Article III standing?  What about being forced to compete on an uneven playing field based on race (without showing that an economic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district?  These injuries are no more concrete than seeing one\xe2\x80\x99s tax dollars spent on religion, but we have recognized each one as enough for standing.  See <em>Friends of Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/167/index.html">528 U.
