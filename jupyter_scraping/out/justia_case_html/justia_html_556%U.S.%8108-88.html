BRILLON<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">VERMONT <em>v</em>. BRILLON</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of vermont</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x9388.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 13, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 9, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">In July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.  Nearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.  During the time between his arrest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to represent him.  Brillon \xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d his first attorney, who served from July 2001 to February 2002.  His third lawyer, who served from March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he reported that Brillon had threatened his life.  His fourth lawyer served from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released him from the case.  His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later, withdrew in April 2003.  Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court denied Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial.  The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, holding that Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s conviction must be vacated, and the charges against him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial required by the Sixth Amendment.  Citing the balancing test this Court stated in <em>Barker</em> v. <em>Wingo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/514/index.html">407 U. S. 514</a>, the Vermont Supreme Court concluded that all four factors described in <em>Barker</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 530\xe2\x80\x94weighed against the State.  Weighing heavily in Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the Vermont court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was \xe2\x80\x9cextreme.\xe2\x80\x9d  In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately considered the period of each counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation.  It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first and third lawyers, should not count against the State.  But the court counted much of the remaining two years against the State.  Delays in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part, by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel, over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward.  As for the third and fourth <em>Barker</em> v. <em>Wingo </em>factors, the court found that Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system.  Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  In applying <em>Barker</em>, the Court has asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Doggett</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/647/index.html">505 U. S. 647</a>, 651.  Delay \xe2\x80\x9cto hamper the defense\xe2\x80\x9d weighs heavily against the prosecution, <em>Barker</em>, 407 U. S., at 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant, <em>id.,</em> at 529.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cthe attorney is the [defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d delay caused by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s counsel is charged against the defendant.  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 753.  The same principle applies whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused, the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender program.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Polk County</em> v. <em>Dodson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/312/index.html">454 U. S. 312</a>, 318.  Unlike a prosecutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a state actor.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would not prompt this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a fundamental error in its application of <em>Barker</em> that calls for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s correction.  The court erred in attributing to the State delays caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behavior in the overall balance.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0An assigned counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move the case forward does not warrant attribution of delay to the State.  Most of the delay the Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time extensions.  Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned counsel.  A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds.  Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance requests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay tactic.  Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately retained counsel\xe2\x80\x99s requests for time extensions.  There is no justification for treating defendants\xe2\x80\x99 speedy-trial claims differently based on whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the period of each counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation discretely.  The court failed appropriately to take into account Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s role during the first year of delay.  Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of trial.  His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third attorney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult for the Defender General\xe2\x80\x99s office to find replacement counsel.  Absent Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attorneys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by assigned counsel is not absolute.  Delay resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the State.  Cf. <em>Polk County</em>, 454 U. S., at 324\xe2\x80\x93325.  But the Vermont Supreme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record suggests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s case.

Nearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.  The Vermont Supreme Court vacated Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and held that the charges against him must be dismissed because he had been denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the time between Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to represent him.  Brillon \xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d the first, who served from July 2001 to February 2002.  His third lawyer, who served from March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he reported that Brillon had threatened his life.  The Vermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the delays associated with those periods, but charged against the State periods in which assigned counsel failed \xe2\x80\x9cto move the case forward.\xe2\x80\x9d  955 A.\xc2\xa02d 1108, 1121, 1122 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system.  Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.  For a total of some six months of the time that elapsed between Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and his trial, Brillon lacked an attorney.  The State may be charged with those months if the gaps resulted from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appoint replacement counsel with dispatch.  Similarly, the State may bear responsibility if there is \xe2\x80\x9ca breakdown in the public defender system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1111.  But, as the Vermont Supreme Court acknowledged, <em>id.,</em> at 1126, the record does not establish any such institutional breakdown.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 27, 2001, Michael Brillon was arrested after striking his girlfriend.  Three days later he was arraigned in state court in Bennington County, Vermont and charged with felony domestic assault.  His alleged status as a habitual offender exposed him to a potential life sentence.  The court ordered him held without bail. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Richard Ammons, from the county public defender\xe2\x80\x99s office, was assigned on the day of arraignment as Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s first counsel.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In October, Ammons filed a motion to recuse the trial judge.  It was denied the next month and trial was scheduled for February 2002.  In mid-January, Ammons moved for a continuance, but the State objected, and the trial court denied the motion.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 22, four days before the jury draw, Ammons again moved for a continuance, citing his heavy workload and the need for further investigation.  Ammons acknowledged that any delay would not count (presumably against the State) for speedy-trial purposes.  The State opposed the motion,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and at the conclusion of a hearing, the trial court denied it.  Brillon, participating in the proceedings through interactive television, then announced: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re fired, Rick.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 187.  Three days later, the trial court\xe2\x80\x94over the State\xe2\x80\x99s objection\xe2\x80\x94granted Ammons\xe2\x80\x99 motion to withdraw as counsel, citing Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s termination of Ammons and Ammons\xe2\x80\x99 statement that he could no longer zealously represent Brillon.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The trial court warned Brillon that further delay would occur while a new attorney became familiar with the case.  The same day, the trial court appointed a second attorney, but he immediately withdrew based on a conflict. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 1, 2002, Gerard Altieri was assigned as Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s third counsel.  On May 20, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss Altieri for, among other reasons, failure to file motions, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]irtually no communication whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d and his lack of diligence \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of heavy case load.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb62, 5, at 113\xe2\x80\x93114.  At a June 11 hearing, Altieri denied several of Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, noted his disagreement with Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s trial strategy,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and insisted he had plenty of time to prepare.  The State opposed Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s motion as well.  Near the end of the hearing, however, Altieri moved to withdraw on the ground that Brillon had threatened his life during a break in the proceedings.  The trial court granted Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss Altieri, but warned Brillon that \xe2\x80\x9cthis is somewhat of a dubious victory in your case because it simply prolongs the time that you will remain in jail until we can bring this matter to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 226.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That same day, the trial court appointed Paul Donaldson as Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s fourth counsel.  At an August 5 status conference, Donaldson requested additional time to conduct discovery in light of his caseload.  A few weeks later, Brillon sent a letter to the court complaining about Donaldson\xe2\x80\x99s unresponsiveness and lack of competence.  Two months later, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss Donaldson\xe2\x80\x94similar to his motion to dismiss Altieri\xe2\x80\x94for failure to file motions and \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually no communication whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb61, 2, at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  At a November 26 hearing, Donaldson reported that his contract with the Defender General\xe2\x80\x99s office had expired in June and that he had been in discussions to have Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s case reassigned.  The trial court released Donaldson from the case \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout making any findings regarding the adequacy of [Donaldson]\xe2\x80\x99s representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1119.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s fifth counsel, David Sleigh, was not assigned until January 15, 2003; Brillon was without counsel during the intervening two months.  On February 25, Sleigh sought extensions of various discovery deadlines, noting that he had been in trial out of town.  App. 117.  On April 10, however, Sleigh withdrew from the case, based on \xe2\x80\x9cmodifications to [his] firm\xe2\x80\x99s contract with the Defender General.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 158.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brillon was then without counsel for the next four months.  On June 20, the Defender General\xe2\x80\x99s office notified the court that it had received \xe2\x80\x9cfunding from the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d and would hire a new special felony unit defender for Brillon.  <em>Id.,</em> at 159.  On August 1, Kathleen Moore was appointed as Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s sixth counsel.  The trial court set November 7 as the deadline for motions, but granted several extensions in accord with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation.  On February 23, 2004, Moore filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.  The trial court denied the motion on April 19.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case finally went to trial on June 14, 2004.  Brillon was found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.  The trial court denied a post-trial motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial, concluding that the delay in Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s trial was \xe2\x80\x9cin large part the result of his own actions\xe2\x80\x9d and that Brillon had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of [the] pre-trial delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court held 3 to 2 that Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s conviction must be vacated and the charges dismissed for violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  Citing the balancing test of <em>Barker</em> v. <em>Wingo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/407/514/index.html">407 U. S. 514</a> (1972), the majority concluded that all four of the factors described in <em>Barker</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94weighed against the State.  <em>Id.,</em> at 530. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court first found that the three-year delay in bringing Brillon to trial was \xe2\x80\x9cextreme\xe2\x80\x9d and weighed heavily in his favor.  See 955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1116.  In assessing the reasons for that delay, the Vermont Supreme Court separately considered the period of each counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation.  It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by Ammons and Altieri, should not count against the State.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1120.  But the court counted much of the remaining two years against the State for delays \xe2\x80\x9ccaused, for the most part, by the failure of several of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assigned counsel, over an inordinate period of time, to move his case forward.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1122.  As for the third and fourth factors, the court found that Brillon \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly and adamantly demanded to be tried,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and that his \xe2\x80\x9clengthy pretrial incarceration\xe2\x80\x9d was prejudicial, despite his insubstantial assertions of evidentiary prejudice, <em>id.,</em> at 1125.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent strongly disputed the majority\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of the periods of delay.  It concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of delay in this case is attributable to defendant, and not to the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1127.  But for Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crepeated maneuvers to dismiss his lawyers and avoid trial through the first eleven months following arraignment,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulty in finding additional counsel would not have arisen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1128.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and now reverse the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy \xe2\x80\xa6 trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  The speedy-trial right is \xe2\x80\x9camorphous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cslippery,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily relative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barker</em>, 407 U.

But the Vermont Supreme Court made a fundamental error in its application of <em>Barker</em> that calls for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s correction.  The Vermont Supreme Court erred in attributing to the State delays caused by \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure of several assigned counsel \xe2\x80\xa6 to move his case forward,\xe2\x80\x9d 955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1122, and in failing adequately to take into account the role of Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive behavior in the overall balance.  </p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vermont Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is driven by the notion that delay caused by assigned counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinaction\xe2\x80\x9d or failure \xe2\x80\x9cto move [the] case forward\xe2\x80\x9d is chargeable to the State, not the defendant.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1111, 1122.  In this case, that court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9ca significant portion of the delay in bringing defendant to trial must be attributed to the state, even though most of the delay was caused by the inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel to move the case forward.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1121.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  An assigned counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure \xe2\x80\x9cto move the case forward\xe2\x80\x9d does not warrant attribution of delay to the State.  Contrary to the Vermont Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, assigned counsel generally are not state actors for purposes of a speedy-trial claim.  While the Vermont Defender General\xe2\x80\x99s office is indeed \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the criminal justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, the individual counsel here acted only on behalf of Brillon, not the State.  See <em>Polk County</em>, 454 U. S., at 320\xe2\x80\x93322 (rejecting the view that public defenders act under color of state law because they are paid by the State).  See also <em>supra</em>, at 8.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the delay that the Vermont Supreme Court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to Brillon as delays caused by his counsel.  During those periods, Brillon was represented by Donaldson, Sleigh, and Moore, all of whom requested extensions and continuances.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Their \xe2\x80\x9cinability or unwillingness \xe2\x80\xa6 to move the case forward,\xe2\x80\x9d 955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1121, may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial grounds.  Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance requests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay tactic.  Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately retained counsel\xe2\x80\x99s requests for time extensions.

The factors identified in <em>Barker</em> \xe2\x80\x9chave no talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  407 U. S., at 533.  Yet the Vermont Supreme Court failed appropriately to take into account Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s role during the first year of delay in \xe2\x80\x9cthe chain of events that started all this.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brillon sought to dismiss Ammons on the eve of trial.  His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to Altieri, whom he threatened, further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult for the Defender General\xe2\x80\x99s office to find replacement counsel.  Even after the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s warning regarding delay, Brillon sought dismissal of yet another attorney, Donaldson.  Just as a State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the [State],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barker</em>, 407 U.

Absent Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate efforts to force the withdrawal of Ammons and Altieri, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen.  The effect of these earlier events should have been factored into the court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of subsequent delay.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by assigned counsel is not absolute.

The case, in my view, does not squarely present that question, for the Vermont Supreme Court, when it found Michael Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s trial unconstitutionally delayed, did not count such delays against the State.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the most part makes that fact clear; at worst some passages are ambiguous.  Given these circumstances, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant time period consists of slightly less than three years, stretching from July 2001, when Brillon was indicted, until mid-June 2004, when he was convicted and sentenced. In light of Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s improper behavior, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, the Vermont Supreme Court did not count months 1 through 12 (mid-July 2001 through mid-June 2002) against the State.  Noting the objection that Brillon had sought to \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally sabotag[e] the criminal proceedings against him,\xe2\x80\x9d the Vermont Supreme Court was explicit that this time period \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not count \xe2\x80\xa6 against the [S]tate.\xe2\x80\x9d  955 A.\xc2\xa02d 1108, 1120 (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vermont Supreme Court did count months 13 through 17 (mid-June 2002 through November 2002) against the State.  It did so under circumstances where (1) Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, Paul Donaldson, revealed that his contract with the defender general\xe2\x80\x99s office had expired in June 2002\xe2\x80\x94shortly after (perhaps before!) he took over as Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, App. 232\xe2\x80\x93233, (2) he stated that this case was \xe2\x80\x9cbasically the beginning of [his] departure from the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> and (3) he made no filings, missed several deadlines, did \xe2\x80\x9clittle or nothing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cmove the case forward,\xe2\x80\x9d and made only one brief appearance at a status conference in mid-August.  955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1121.  I believe it fairer to characterize this period, not as a period in which \xe2\x80\x9cassigned counsel\xe2\x80\x9d failed to move the case forward, <em>ante</em>, at 1, but as a period in which Brillon, in practice, <em>had no assigned counsel</em>.  And, given that the State conceded its responsibility for delays caused by another defender who resigned for \xe2\x80\x9ccontractual reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>infra </em>at 3, it is hardly unreasonable that the Vermont Supreme Court counted this period of delay against the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Vermont Supreme Court also counted months 18 through 25 (the end of November 2002 through July 2003) against the State.  It did so because the State conceded in its brief that this period of delay \xe2\x80\x9c<em>cannot be attributed to the defendant.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 78 (emphasis added).<em> </em> This concession is not surprising in light of the fact that during much of this period, Brillon was represented by David Sleigh, a contract attorney, who during the course of his representation filed nothing on Brillon\xe2\x80\x99s behalf except a single motion seeking to extend discovery.  The record reflects no other actions by Sleigh other than a letter sent to Brillon informing him that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a result of modifications to our firm\xe2\x80\x99s contract with the Defender General, we will not be representing you in your pending case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 158.  Brillon was left without counsel for a period of nearly six months.  The State explained in conceding its responsibility for this delay that Sleigh had been forced to withdraw \xe2\x80\x9cfor contractual reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the defender general\xe2\x80\x99s office had been unable to replace him \xe2\x80\x9cfor funding reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 78.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Vermont Supreme Court counted against the State the last 11 months\xe2\x80\x94from August 2003 to mid-June 2004.  But it is impossible to conclude from the opinion whether it did so because it held the State responsible for the defender\xe2\x80\x99s failure to \xe2\x80\x9cmove the case forward,\xe2\x80\x9d or for other reasons having nothing to do with counsel, namely the judge\xe2\x80\x99s unavailability, see <em>id.</em>, at 138, or the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [case] files were incomplete\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadditional documents were needed from the State,\xe2\x80\x9d 955 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 1120\xe2\x80\x931121.  Treating the opinion as charging the State on the basis of the defender\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is made more difficult by the fact that Brillon did not argue below that Kathleen Moore, his defender during this period, caused any delays.  Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Reply Brief in No. 2005\xe2\x80\x93167 (Vt.), 2007 WL 990004, *7.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I can find no convincing reason to believe the Vermont Supreme Court made the error of constitutional law that the majority attributes to it.  Rather than read ambiguities in its opinion against it, thereby assuming the presence of the error the Court finds, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  As a majority nonetheless wishes to decide the case, I would note that the Vermont Supreme Court has considerable authority to supervise the appointment of public defenders.  See Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75204, 5272 (1998); see also Vt. Rule Crim. Proc. 44 (2003).  It consequently warrants leeway when it decides whether a particular failing is properly attributed to assigned counsel or instead to the failure of the defender general\xe2\x80\x99s office properly to assign counsel.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I do not believe the Vermont Supreme Court exceeded that leeway here.
