A perpetual injunction was awarded and an appeal allowed by a justice of this Court.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We think this case is governed by <em>Railroad Company v. Grant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/98/398/case.html">98 U. S. 398</a></span>.  In that case, we held that the Act of Feb. 25, 1879, c. 99, secs. 4, 5, 20 Stat. 320, took away our right to hear and determine cases from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia where the matter in dispute did not exceed $2,500, and that it operated on pending cases which had been brought here under the provisions of sec. 847 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District.  This case came here under sec. 848, which provided for the allowance of appeals and writs of error by the justices of this Court under certain circumstances when the matter in dispute was less than $1,000, the then general jurisdictional amount, but exceeded $100.  There is no reservation in the repealing act as to this class of pending cases any more than the other.  Both sections have reference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 103 U. S. 523</a></p><p> to the same general subject matter -- that is to say, our review of the judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the District in cases where jurisdiction has been made to depend on the value of the matter in dispute.  Under the act of 1879, we can no longer hear any of that class of cases unless the amount exceeds $2,500.</p>\n<p><em>Appeal dismissed, each party to pay his own costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
