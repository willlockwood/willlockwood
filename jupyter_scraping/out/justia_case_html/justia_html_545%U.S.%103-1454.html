Respondents Raich and Monson are California residents who both use doctor-recommended marijuana for serious medical conditions.  After federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents seized and destroyed all six of Monson\xe2\x80\x99s cannabis plants, respondents brought this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.  Respondents claim that enforcing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause and other constitutional provisions.  The District Court denied respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that they had demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the claim that the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority as applied to the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient\xe2\x80\x99s physician pursuant to valid California state law.  The court relied heavily on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html">514 U. S. 549</a>, and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U.

Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0For the purposes of consolidating various drug laws into a comprehensive statute, providing meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthening law enforcement tools against international and interstate drug trafficking, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II of which is the CSA.  To effectuate the statutory goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except as authorized by the CSA.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1), 844(a).  All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, \xc2\xa7812, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811, 812.<em> </em>Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, \xc2\xa7812(c),  based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment, \xc2\xa7812(b)(1).  This classification renders the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana a criminal offense.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1), 844(a).  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established.  See, <em>e.g., Perez</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/146/index.html">402 U. S. 146</a>, 151.  If Congress decides that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98total incidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class.  See, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 154\xe2\x80\x93155.  Of particular relevance here is <em>Wickard</em> v. <em>Filburn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/index.html">317 U. S. 111</a>, 127\xe2\x80\x93128, where, in rejecting the appellee farmer\xe2\x80\x99s contention that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 admitted power to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not authorize federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the appellee\xe2\x80\x99s own consumption, the Court established that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.  The similarities between this case and <em>Wickard</em> are striking.  In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.  In assessing the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority, the Court need not determine whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d exists for so concluding.  <em>E.g., Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 557.  Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, the Court has no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 heavy reliance on <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison </em>overlooks the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases, while also reading those cases far too broadly.  The statutory challenges at issue there were markedly different from the challenge here.  Respondents ask the Court to excise individual applications of a concededly valid comprehensive statutory scheme.  In contrast, in both <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em>, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power in its entirety.  This distinction is pivotal for the Court has often reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power \xe2\x80\x98to excise, as trivial, individual instances\xe2\x80\x99 of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perez, </em>402 U. S., at 154.  Moreover, the Court emphasized that the laws at issue in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em> had nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d or any sort of economic enterprise.  See <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S., at 561; <em>Morrison, </em>529 U. S., at 610.  In contrast, the CSA regulates quintessentially economic activities: the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market.  Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational means of regulating commerce in that product.  The Ninth Circuit cast doubt on the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality by isolating a distinct class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power: the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.  However, Congress clearly acted rationally in determining that this subdivided class of activities is an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.  The case comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation.  Given the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s findings and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for marijuana, <em>Wickard</em> and its progeny foreclose that claim.

In 1913, California was one of the first States to prohibit the sale and possession of marijuana,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and at the end of the century, California became the first State to authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes.  In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, now codified as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The proposition was designed to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cseriously ill\xe2\x80\x9d residents of the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes, and to encourage Federal and State Governments to take steps towards ensuring the safe and affordable distribution of the drug to patients in need.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Act creates an exemption from criminal prosecution for physicians,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] as well as for patients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  A \xe2\x80\x9cprimary caregiver\xe2\x80\x9d is a person who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of the patient.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are California residents who suffer from a variety of serious medical conditions and have sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the Compassionate Use Act.  They are being treated by licensed, board-certified family practitioners, who have concluded, after prescribing a host of conventional medicines to treat respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conditions and to alleviate their associated symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective treatment.  Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several years pursuant to their doctors\xe2\x80\x99 recommendation, and both rely heavily on cannabis to function on a daily basis.  Indeed, Raich\xe2\x80\x99s physician believes that forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and ingests the drug in a variety of ways including smoking and using a vaporizer.  Respondent Raich, by contrast, is unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two caregivers, litigating as \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Does,\xe2\x80\x9d to provide her with locally grown marijuana at no charge.  These caregivers also process the cannabis into hashish or keif, and Raich herself processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and foods for consumption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) came to Monson\xe2\x80\x99s home.  After a thorough investigation, the county officials concluded that her use of marijuana was entirely lawful as a matter of California law.  Nevertheless, after a 3-hour standoff, the federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis plants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents thereafter brought this action against the Attorney General of the United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 84 Stat. 1242, 21  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801 <em>et seq</em>., to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.  In their complaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson described the severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly futile attempts to obtain relief with conventional medications, and the opinions of their doctors concerning their need to use marijuana.  Respondents claimed that enforcing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, and the doctrine of medical necessity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court denied respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion for a preliminary injunction.  <em>Raich </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>248 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 918 (ND Cal. 2003).  Although the court found that the federal enforcement interests \xe2\x80\x9cwane[d]\xe2\x80\x9d when compared to the harm that California residents would suffer if denied access to medically necessary marijuana, it concluded that respondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their legal claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 931.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Raich </em>v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 352 F.\xc2\xa03d 1222 (2003).  The court found that respondents had \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on their claim that, as applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1227.  The Court of Appeals distinguished prior Circuit cases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause challenges by focusing on what it deemed to be the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>separate and distinct class of activities</em>\xe2\x80\x9d at issue in this case: \xe2\x80\x9cthe intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient\xe2\x80\x99s physician pursuant to valid California state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1228.  The court found the latter class of activities \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent in kind from drug trafficking\xe2\x80\x9d because interposing a physician\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation raises different health and safety concerns, and because \xe2\x80\x9cthis limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug market\xe2\x80\x94as well as any broader commercial market for medicinal marijuana\xe2\x80\x94insofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this case is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lopez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html">514 U.

S. 598</a> (2000), as interpreted by recent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal power.  In contrast, the dissenting judge concluded that the CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly valid under <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison;</em> moreover, he thought it \xe2\x80\x9csimply impossible to distinguish the relevant conduct surrounding the cultivation and use of the marijuana crop at issue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat crop that affected interstate commerce in <em>Wickard</em> v. <em>Filburn</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 1235 (Beam, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant of certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/936/index.html">542 U. S. 936</a> (2004).  The case is made difficult by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 strong arguments that they will suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional finding to the contrary, marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes.  The question before us, however, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circumstances; rather, it is whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate interstate markets for medicinal substances encompasses the portions of those markets that are supplied with drugs produced and consumed locally.  Well-settled law controls our answer.  The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power, even as applied to the troubling facts of this case.  We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon declared a national \xe2\x80\x9cwar on drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  As the first campaign of that war, Congress set out to enact legislation that would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement tools against the traffic in illicit drugs.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  That effort culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This was not, however, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 first attempt to regulate the national market in drugs.  Rather, as early as 1906 Congress enacted federal legislation imposing labeling regulations on medications and prohibiting the manufacture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded drug traveling in interstate commerce.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Aside from these labeling restrictions, most domestic drug regulations prior to 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with the Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s primary enforcer.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  For example, the primary drug control law, before being repealed by the passage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785 (repealed 1970).  The Harrison Act sought to exert control over the possession and sale of narcotics, specifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers, distributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal Government, by assessing taxes against parties so registered, and by regulating the issuance of prescriptions.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the Federal Government until 1937 when accounts of marijuana\xe2\x80\x99s addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired with dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and local levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act, Pub. L. 75\xe2\x80\x93238, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana Tax Act did not outlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright.  Rather, it imposed registration and reporting requirements for all individuals importing, producing, selling, or dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual taxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug changed hands.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes were required to comply with rather burdensome administrative requirements.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Noncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penalties, whereas compliance would often subject them to prosecution under state law.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Thus, while the Marihuana Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal <em>per se</em>, the onerous administrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive taxes, and the risks attendant on compliance practically curtailed the marijuana trade.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then in 1970, after declaration of the national \xe2\x80\x9cwar on drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d federal drug policy underwent a significant transformation.  A number of noteworthy events precipitated this policy shift.  First, in <em>Leary</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/6/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/6/index.html">395 U. S. 6</a> (1969), this Court held certain provisions of the Marihuana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation unconstitutional.  Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson fundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agencies.  The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the Department of Treasury, merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, currently housed in the Department of Justice.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Finally, prompted by a perceived need to consolidate the growing number of piecemeal drug laws and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title II of that Act, the CSA, repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.  The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Congress was particularly concerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1), 844(a).  The CSA categorizes all controlled substances into five schedules.  \xc2\xa7812.  The drugs are grouped together based on their accepted medical uses, the potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7811, 812.<em> </em>Each schedule is associated with a distinct set of controls regarding the manufacture, distribution, and use of the substances listed therein.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x93830.  The CSA and its implementing regulations set forth strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping.  <em>Ibid.</em>  21 CFR \xc2\xa71301 <em>et seq. </em>(2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812(c).  This preliminary classification was based, in part, on the recommendation of the Assistant Secretary of HEW \xe2\x80\x9cthat marihuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Schedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment.  \xc2\xa7812(b)(1).  These three factors, in varying gradations, are also used to categorize drugs in the other four schedules.  For example, Schedule II substances also have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I drugs, they have a currently accepted medical use.  \xc2\xa7812(b)(2).  By classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug, as opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana became a criminal offense, with the sole exception being use of the drug as part of a Food and Drug Administration pre-approved research study.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/483/index.html">532 U. S. 483</a>, 490 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CSA provides for the periodic updating of schedules and delegates authority to the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to add, remove, or transfer substances to, from, or between schedules.  \xc2\xa7811.  Despite considerable efforts to reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents in this case do not dispute that passage of the CSA, as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, was well within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power.  Brief for Respondents 22, 38.  Nor do they contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.  Rather, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is actually quite limited; they argue that the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s categorical prohibition of the manufacture and possession of marijuana as applied to the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana for medical purposes pursuant to California law exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in isolation.  As charted in considerable detail in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez</em>, our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause, as well as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 assertion of authority thereunder, has evolved over time.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 response to the central problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal commerce power under the Articles of Confederation.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  For the first century of our history, the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of discriminatory state legislation that had once been permissible.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Then, in response to rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent national economy, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce power,\xe2\x80\x9d beginning with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, 24 Stat. 379, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72 <em>et seq.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cases decided during that \xe2\x80\x9cnew era,\xe2\x80\x9d which now spans more than a century, have identified three general categories of regulation in which Congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power.  First, Congress can regulate the channels of interstate commerce.  <em>Perez</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/146/index.html">402 U. S. 146</a>, 150 (1971).  Second, Congress has authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate commerce.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Third, Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/1/index.html">301 U. S. 1</a>, 37 (1937).  Only the third category is implicated in the case at hand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our case law firmly establishes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  See, <em>e.g., Perez</em>, 402 U. S., at 151; <em>Wickard </em>v. <em>Filburn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/111/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/111/index.html">317 U. S. 111</a>, 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (1942).  As we stated in <em>Wickard</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if appellee\xe2\x80\x99s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 125.  We have never required Congress to legislate with scientific exactitude.  When Congress decides that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98total incidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class.  See <em>Perez</em>, 402 U. S., at 154\xe2\x80\x93155 (quoting <em>Westfall </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/256/index.html">274 U.

In this vein, we have reiterated that when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the <em>de minimis</em> character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 558 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wirtz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/183/index.html">392 U. S. 183</a>, 196, n.\xc2\xa027 (1968)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Wickard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/111/index.html"></a><a href="/us/317/111/index.html">317 U. S. 111</a>, is of particular relevance.  In <em>Wickard</em>, we upheld the application of regulations promulgated under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were designed to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent abnormally low prices.  The regulations established an allotment of 11.1 acres for Filburn\xe2\x80\x99s 1941 wheat crop, but he sowed 23 acres, intending to use the excess by consuming it on his own farm.  Filburn argued that even though we had sustained Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate the production of goods for commerce, that power did not authorize \xe2\x80\x9cfederal regulation [of] production not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wickard, </em>317 U. S., at 118.  Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for a unanimous Court rejected this submission.  He wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe effect of the statute before us is to restrict the amount which may be produced for market and the extent as well to which one may forestall resort to the market by producing to meet his own needs.  That appellee\xe2\x80\x99s own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 127\xe2\x80\x93128.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>Wickard</em> thus establishes that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial,\xe2\x80\x9d in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The similarities between this case and <em>Wickard</em> are striking.  Like the farmer in <em>Wickard</em>, respondents are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was designed \xe2\x80\x9cto control the volume [of wheat] moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently control the market price, <em>id.</em>, at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug markets.  See nn.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321, <em>supra</em>.  In <em>Wickard</em>, we had no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed in the aggregate, leaving home-consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions.  Here too, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interstate market, resulting in lower market prices.  <em>Wickard</em>, 317 U. S., at 128.  The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market.  While the diversion of homegrown wheat tended to frustrate the federal interest in stabilizing prices by regulating the volume of commercial transactions in the interstate market, the diversion of homegrown marijuana tends to frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market in their entirety.  In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, respondents suggest that <em>Wickard</em> differs from this case in three respects: (1) the Agricultural Adjustment Act, unlike the CSA, exempted small farming operations; (2) <em>Wickard</em> involved a \xe2\x80\x9cquintessential economic activity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a commercial farm\xe2\x80\x94whereas respondents do not sell marijuana; and (3) the <em>Wickard</em> record made it clear that the aggregate production of wheat for use on farms had a significant impact on market prices.  Those differences, though factually accurate, do not diminish the precedential force of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that Wickard\xe2\x80\x99s own impact on the market was \xe2\x80\x9ctrivial by itself\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was not a sufficient reason for removing him from the scope of federal regulation.  317 U. S., at 127.  That the Secretary of Agriculture elected to exempt even smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his power to regulate all those whose aggregated production was significant, nor did that fact play any role in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  Moreover, even though Wickard was indeed a commercial farmer, the activity he was engaged in\xe2\x80\x94the cultivation of wheat for home consumption\xe2\x80\x94was not treated by the Court as part of his commercial farming operation.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  And while it is true that the record in the <em>Wickard </em>case itself established the causal connection between the production for local use and the national market, we have before us findings by Congress to the same effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Findings in the introductory sections of the CSA explain why Congress deemed it appropriate to encompass local activities within the scope of the CSA.  See n.\xc2\xa020, <em>supra</em>.  The submissions of the parties and the numerous <em>amici</em> all seem to agree that the national, and international, market for marijuana has dimensions that are fully comparable to those defining the class of activities regulated by the Secretary pursuant to the 1938 statute.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Respondents nonetheless insist that the CSA cannot be constitutionally applied to their activities because Congress did not make a specific finding that the intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes based on the recommendation of a physician would substantially affect the larger interstate marijuana market.  Be that as it may, we have never required Congress to make particularized findings in order to legislate, see <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 562; <em>Perez</em>, 402 U. S., at 156, absent a special concern such as the protection of free speech, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 664\xe2\x80\x93668 (1994) (plurality opinion).  While congressional findings are certainly helpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme, particularly when the connection to commerce is not self-evident, and while we will consider congressional findings in our analysis when they are available, the absence of particularized findings does not call into question Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to legislate.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In assessing the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a modest one.  We need not determine whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d exists for so concluding.  <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 557; see also <em>Hodel</em> v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/index.html">452 U. S. 264</a>, 276\xe2\x80\x93280 (1981); <em>Perez</em>, 402 U. S., at 155\xe2\x80\x93156; <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>McClung</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/294/index.html">379 U.

Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels,[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA.  Thus, as in <em>Wickard</em>, when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity, Congress was acting well within its authority to \xe2\x80\x9cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate Commerce \xe2\x80\xa6 among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78.  That the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment.  As we have done many times before, we refuse to excise individual components of that larger scheme.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support their contrary submission, respondents rely heavily on two of our more recent Commerce Clause cases.  In their myopic focus, they overlook the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases.  Moreover, even in the narrow prism of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 creation, they read those cases far too broadly.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those two cases, of course, are <em>Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/549/index.html">514 U.

As an initial matter, the statutory challenges at issue in those cases were markedly different from the challenge respondents pursue in the case at hand.  Here, respondents ask us to excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.  In contrast, in both <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em>, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power in its entirety.  This distinction is pivotal for we have often reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power \xe2\x80\x98to excise, as trivial, individual instances\xe2\x80\x99 of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Perez, </em>402 U.

S. 549</a>, was the validity of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which was a brief, single-subject statute making it a crime for an individual to possess a gun in a school zone.  104 Stat. 4844\xe2\x80\x934845, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(q)(1)(A).  The Act did not regulate any economic activity and did not contain any requirement that the possession of a gun have any connection to past interstate activity or a predictable impact on future commercial activity.  Distinguishing our earlier cases holding that comprehensive regulatory statutes may be validly applied to local conduct that does not, when viewed in isolation, have a significant impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute invalid.  We explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSection 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x98commerce\xe2\x80\x99 or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.  Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.  It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S., at 561.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory scheme that the Government is defending in this litigation is at the opposite end of the regulatory spectrum.  As explained above, the CSA, enacted in 1970 as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 84 Stat. 1242\xe2\x80\x931284, was a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most of those substances\xe2\x80\x94those listed in Schedules II through V\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chave a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d  21  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(1).  The regulatory scheme is designed to foster the beneficial use of those medications, to prevent their misuse, and to prohibit entirely the possession or use of substances listed in Schedule I, except as a part of a strictly controlled research project.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the statute provided for the periodic updating of the five schedules, Congress itself made the initial classifications.  It identified 42 opiates, 22 opium derivatives, and 17 hallucinogenic substances as Schedule I drugs.  84 Stat. 1248.  Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the third subcategory.  That classification, unlike the discrete prohibition established by the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, was merely one of many \xe2\x80\x9cessential part[s] of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 561.[<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Our opinion in <em>Lopez</em> casts no doubt on the validity of such a program.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/598/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a>.  The Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1902, created a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated crimes of violence.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713981.  The remedy was enforceable in both state and federal courts, and generally depended on proof of the violation of a state law.  Despite congressional findings that such crimes had an adverse impact on interstate commerce, we held the statute unconstitutional because, like the statute in <em>Lopez</em>, it did not regulate economic activity.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Lopez</em>, and that our prior cases had identified a clear pattern of analysis: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 610.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike those at issue in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em>, the activities regulated by the CSA are quintessentially economic.  \xe2\x80\x9cEconomics\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966).  The CSA is a statute that regulates the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market.  Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that product.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Such prohibitions include specific decisions requiring that a drug be withdrawn from the market as a result of the failure to comply with regulatory requirements as well as decisions excluding Schedule I drugs entirely from the market.  Because the CSA is a statute that directly regulates economic, commercial activity, our opinion in <em>Morrison</em> casts no doubt on its constitutionality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals was able to conclude otherwise only by isolating a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate and distinct\xe2\x80\x9d class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power, defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1229.  The court characterized this class as \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent in kind from drug trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1228.  The differences between the members of a class so defined and the principal traffickers in Schedule I substances might be sufficient to justify a policy decision exempting the narrower class from the coverage of the CSA.  The question, however, is whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 contrary policy judgment, <em>i.e.</em>, its decision to include this narrower \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d within the larger regulatory scheme, was constitutionally deficient.  We have no difficulty concluding that Congress acted rationally in determining that none of the characteristics making up the purported class, whether viewed individually or in the aggregate, compelled an exemption from the CSA; rather, the subdivided class of activities defined by the Court of Appeals was an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the fact that marijuana is used \xe2\x80\x9cfor personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician\xe2\x80\x9d cannot itself serve as a distinguishing factor.  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1229.  The CSA designates marijuana as contraband for <em>any</em> purpose; in fact, by characterizing marijuana as a Schedule I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no acceptable medical uses.  Moreover, the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime specifically designed to regulate which controlled substances can be utilized for medicinal purposes, and in what manner.  Indeed, most of the substances classified in the CSA \xe2\x80\x9chave a useful and legitimate medical purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  21  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(1).  Thus, even if respondents are correct that marijuana does have accepted medical uses and thus should be redesignated as a lesser schedule drug,[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] the CSA would still impose controls beyond what is required by California law.  The CSA requires manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, and other handlers of controlled substances to comply with statutory and regulatory provisions mandating registration with the DEA, compliance with specific production quotas, security controls to guard against diversion, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and prescription requirements.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7821\xe2\x80\x93830; 21 CFR \xc2\xa71301 <em>et seq. </em>(2004).  Furthermore, the dispensing of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federal approval.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rutherford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/544/index.html">442 U. S. 544</a> (1979).  Accordingly, the mere fact that marijuana\xe2\x80\x94like virtually every other controlled substance regulated by the CSA\xe2\x80\x94is used for medicinal purposes cannot possibly serve to distinguish it from the core activities regulated by the CSA. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can it serve as an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective marke[r]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cobjective facto[r]\xe2\x80\x9d to arbitrarily narrow the relevant class as the dissenters suggest, <em>post</em>, at 6 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); <em>post</em>, at 12 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  More fundamentally, if, as the principal dissent contends, the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is beyond the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98outer limits\xe2\x80\x99 of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 1 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting), it must also be true that such personal use of marijuana (or any other homegrown drug) for recreational purposes is also beyond those \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98outer limits,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not a State elects to authorize or even regulate such use.  Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 separate dissent suffers from the same sweeping implications.  That is, the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 rationale logically extends to place <em>any </em>federal regulation (including quality, prescription, or quantity controls) of <em>any </em>locally cultivated and possessed controlled substance for <em>any </em>purpose beyond the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98outer limits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Commerce Clause authority.  One need not have a degree in economics to understand why a nationwide exemption for the vast quantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated for personal use (which presumably would include use by friends, neighbors, and family members) may have a substantial impact on the interstate market for this extraordinarily popular substance.  The congressional judgment that an exemption for such a significant segment of the total market would undermine the orderly enforcement of the entire regulatory scheme is entitled to a strong presumption of validity.  Indeed, that judgment is not only rational, but \xe2\x80\x9cvisible to the naked eye,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 563, under any commonsense appraisal of the probable consequences of such an open-ended exemption.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possession and cultivation \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with state law\xe2\x80\x9d cannot serve to place respondents\xe2\x80\x99 activities beyond congressional reach.  The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall prevail.  It is beyond peradventure that federal power over commerce is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d however legitimate or dire those necessities may be.  <em>Wirtz</em>, 392 U. S., at 196 (quoting <em>Sanitary Dist. of Chicago </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/405/index.html">266 U. S. 405</a>, 426 (1925)).  See also 392 U.

Just as state acquiescence to federal regulation cannot expand the bounds of the Commerce Clause, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 661\xe2\x80\x93662 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that 38 States requested federal intervention), so too state action cannot circumscribe Congress\xe2\x80\x99 plenary commerce power.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Darby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/index.html">312 U. S. 100</a>, 114 (1941) (\xe2\x80\x9cThat power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents acknowledge this proposition, but nonetheless contend that their activities were not \xe2\x80\x9can essential part of a larger regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d because they had been \xe2\x80\x9cisolated by the State of California, and [are] policed by the State of California,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus remain \xe2\x80\x9centirely separated from the market.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.  The dissenters fall prey to similar reasoning.  See n. 38, <em>supra</em> this page.  The notion that California law has surgically excised a discrete activity that is hermetically sealed off from the larger interstate marijuana market is a dubious proposition, and, more importantly, one that Congress could have rationally rejected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, that the California exemptions will have a significant impact on both the supply and demand sides of the market for marijuana is not just \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d as the principal dissent concedes, <em>post</em>, at 16 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting), it is readily apparent.  The exemption for physicians provides them with an economic incentive to grant their patients permission to use the drug.  In contrast to most prescriptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage and duration of the usage, under California law the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s permission to recommend marijuana use is open-ended.  The authority to grant permission whenever the doctor determines that a patient is afflicted with \xe2\x80\x9cany other illness for which marijuana provides relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa711362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), is broad enough to allow even the most scrupulous doctor to conclude that some recreational uses would be therapeutic.[<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  And our cases have taught us that there are some unscrupulous physicians who overprescribe when it is sufficiently profitable to do so.[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The exemption for cultivation by patients and caregivers can only increase the supply of marijuana in the California market.[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  The likelihood that all such production will promptly terminate when patients recover or will precisely match the patients\xe2\x80\x99 medical needs during their convalescence seems remote; whereas the danger that excesses will satisfy some of the admittedly enormous demand for recreational use seems obvious.[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Moreover, that the national and international narcotics trade has thrived in the face of vigorous criminal enforcement efforts suggests that no small number of unscrupulous people will make use of the California exemptions to serve their commercial ends whenever it is feasible to do so.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  Taking into account the fact that California is only one of at least nine States to have authorized the medical use of marijuana, a fact Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s dissent conveniently disregards in arguing that the demonstrated effect on commerce while admittedly \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d is ultimately \xe2\x80\x9cunsubstantiated,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 14, 16, Congress could have rationally concluded that the aggregate impact on the national market of all the transactions exempted from federal supervision is unquestionably substantial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, from the \xe2\x80\x9cseparate and distinct\xe2\x80\x9d class of activities identified by the Court of Appeals (and adopted by the dissenters), we are left with \xe2\x80\x9cthe intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession and use of marijuana.\xe2\x80\x9d  352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1229.  Thus the case for the exemption comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation.  Given the findings in the CSA and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for marijuana, our decisions in <em>Wickard</em> v. <em>Filburn</em> and the later cases endorsing its reasoning foreclose that claim.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also raise a substantive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medical necessity defense.  These theories of relief were set forth in their complaint but were not reached by the Court of Appeals.  We therefore do not address the question whether judicial relief is available to respondents on these alternative bases.  We do note, however, the presence of another avenue of relief.  As the Solicitor General confirmed during oral argument, the statute authorizes procedures for the reclassification of Schedule I drugs.  But perhaps even more important than these legal avenues is the democratic process, in which the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress.  Under the present state of the law, however, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See<em> </em>Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711.71.090, 17.37.010\xe2\x80\x9317.37.080 (Lexis 2004); Colo.

Rather, as this Court has acknowledged since at least <em>United States</em> v. <em>Coombs,</em> 12 Pet. 72 (1838), Congress\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority over intrastate activities that are not themselves part of interstate commerce (including activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper Clause.  <em>Id.</em>, at 78; <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>McClung</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/294/index.html">379 U.

Most directly, the commerce power permits Congress not only to devise rules for the governance of commerce between States but also to facilitate interstate commerce by eliminating potential obstructions, and to restrict it by eliminating potential stimulants.  See <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/301/1/index.html">301 U. S. 1</a>, 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (1937).

Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 560; <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 610 (same).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This principle is not without limitation.

As the Court put it in <em>Wrightwood Dairy</em>, where Congress has the authority to enact a regulation of interstate commerce, \xe2\x80\x9cit possesses every power needed to make that regulation effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  315 U. S., at 118\xe2\x80\x93119.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this power \xe2\x80\x9cto make \xe2\x80\xa6 regulation effective\xe2\x80\x9d commonly overlaps with the authority to regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and may in some cases have been confused with that authority, the two are distinct.  The regulation of an intrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive regulation of interstate commerce even though the intrastate activity does not itself \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially affect\xe2\x80\x9d interstate commerce.  Moreover, as the passage from <em>Lopez</em> quoted above<em> </em>suggests, Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce.  See <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 561.  The relevant question is simply whether the means chosen are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power.  See <em>Darby</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 121. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Darby</em>, for instance, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress, having \xe2\x80\xa6 adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards,\xe2\x80\x9d 312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce to conform to wage and hour standards, <em>id.</em>, at 119\xe2\x80\x93121, but could also require those employers to keep employment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the regulatory scheme, <em>id.</em>, at 125.  While the Court sustained the former regulation on the alternative ground that the activity it regulated could have a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat effect\xe2\x80\x9d on interstate commerce, <em>id.</em>, at 122\xe2\x80\x93123, it affirmed the latter on the sole ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to a legitimate end,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 125.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court said in the <em>Shreveport Rate Cases</em>, the Necessary and Proper Clause does not give \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State, as such,\xe2\x80\x9d but it does allow Congress \xe2\x80\x9cto take all measures necessary or appropriate to\xe2\x80\x9d the effective regulation of the interstate market, \xe2\x80\x9calthough intrastate transactions \xe2\x80\xa6 may thereby be controlled.\xe2\x80\x9d  234 U. S., at 353; see also <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel</em> <em>Corp.</em>, 301 U. S., at 38 (the logic of the <em>Shreveport Rate Cases</em> is not limited to instrumentalities of commerce).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s principal dissent objects that, by permitting Congress to regulate activities necessary to effective interstate regulation, the Court reduces <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em> to \xe2\x80\x9clittle more than a drafting guide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  I think that criticism unjustified.  Unlike the power to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, the power to enact laws enabling effective regulation of interstate commerce can only be exercised in conjunction with congressional regulation of an interstate market, and it extends only to those measures necessary to make the interstate regulation effective.  As <em>Lopez </em>itself states, and the Court affirms today, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities only where the failure to do so \xe2\x80\x9ccould \xe2\x80\xa6 undercut\xe2\x80\x9d its regulation of interstate commerce.  See <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 561;<em> ante</em>, at 15, 21, 22.  This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line between \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is truly national and what is truly local.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 567\xe2\x80\x93568.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison</em> affirm that Congress may not regulate certain \xe2\x80\x9cpurely local\xe2\x80\x9d activity within the States based solely on the attenuated effect that such activity may have in the interstate market.  But those decisions do not declare noneconomic intrastate activities to be categorically beyond the reach of the Federal Government.  Neither case involved the power of Congress to exert control over intrastate activities in connection with a more comprehensive scheme of regulation; <em>Lopez </em>expressly disclaimed that it was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and <em>Morrison</em> did not even discuss the possibility that it was.  (The Court of Appeals in <em>Morrison</em> made clear that it was not.  See <em>Brzonkala </em>v. <em>Virginia Polytechnic Inst.</em>, 169 F.\xc2\xa03d 820, 834\xe2\x80\x93835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).)  To dismiss this distinction as \xe2\x80\x9csuperficial and formalistic,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>post</em>, at 6 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting), is to misunderstand the nature of the Necessary and Proper Clause, which empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated powers that are not within its authority to enact in isolation.  See <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 421\xe2\x80\x93422 (1819).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there are other restraints upon the Necessary and Proper Clause authority.  As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland</em>, even when the end is constitutional and legitimate, the means must be \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplainly adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to that end.  <em>Id.</em>, at 421.  Moreover, they may not be otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited\xe2\x80\x9d and must be \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  These phrases are not merely hortatory.  For example, cases such as <em>Printz </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a> (1997), and <em>New York </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a> (1992), affirm that a law is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>proper </em>for carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen [it] violates [a constitutional] principle of state sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Printz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 923\xe2\x80\x93924; see also <em>New York</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 166.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The application of these principles to the case before us is straightforward.  In the CSA, Congress has undertaken to extinguish the interstate market in Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana.  The Commerce Clause unquestionably permits this.  The power to regulate interstate commerce \xe2\x80\x9cextends not only to those regulations which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those which prohibit it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Darby</em>, 312 U. S., at 113.  See also <em>Hipolite Egg Co.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/220/45/index.html">220 U. S. 45</a>, 58 (1911); <em>Lottery Case,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/188/321/index.html">188 U. S. 321</a>, 354 (1903).  To effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost all intrastate activities related to Schedule I substances\xe2\x80\x94both economic activities (manufacture, distribution, possession with the intent to distribute) and noneconomic activities (simple possession).  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a), 844(a).  That simple possession is a noneconomic activity is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a necessary part of a larger regulation.  Rather, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether they are appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By this measure, I think the regulation must be sustained.  Not only is it impossible to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled substances manufactured and distributed interstate,\xe2\x80\x9d but it hardly makes sense to speak in such terms.  Drugs like marijuana are fungible commodities.  As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home and possessed for personal use is never more than an instant from the interstate market\xe2\x80\x94and this is so whether or not the possession is for medicinal use or lawful use under the laws of a particular State.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9330.  Congress need not accept on faith that state law will be effective in maintaining a strict division between a lawful market for \xe2\x80\x9cmedical\xe2\x80\x9d marijuana and the more general marijuana market.  See <em>id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, and n. 38.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo impose on [Congress] the necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCulloch</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 424.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest any violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would render this regulation \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 421\xe2\x80\x94except to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to state regulation.  See <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, 11 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.); <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (opinion of Thomas, J.); Brief for Respondents 39\xe2\x80\x9342.  That is not enough to render federal regulation an inappropriate means.  The Court has repeatedly recognized that, if authorized by the commerce power, Congress may regulate private endeavors \xe2\x80\x9ceven when [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National League of Cities </em>v. <em>Usery</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/833/index.html">426 U. S. 833</a>, 840 (1976); see <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/329/14/index.html">329 U. S. 14</a>, 19 (1946); <em>McCulloch, supra</em>, at 424.  At bottom, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 state-sovereignty argument reduces to the contention that federal regulation of the activities permitted by California\xe2\x80\x99s Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary to be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of the interstate market.  For the reasons given above and in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I thus agree with the Court that, however the class of regulated activities is subdivided, Congress could reasonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting marijuana from the interstate market \xe2\x80\x9ccould be undercut\xe2\x80\x9d if those activities were excepted from its general scheme of regulation.  See <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 561.

Of course it is in addition difficult to imagine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interstate market in guns could have as an appropriate means of effectuation the prohibition of guns within 1000 feet of schools (and nowhere else).

Exercising those powers, California (by ballot initiative and then by legislative codification) has come to its own conclusion about the difficult and sensitive question of whether marijuana should be available to relieve severe pain and suffering.  Today the Court sanctions an application of the federal Controlled Substances Act that extinguishes that experiment, without any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of federal regulation.  In so doing, the Court announces a rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate broadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause\xe2\x80\x94nestling questionable assertions of its authority into comprehensive regulatory schemes\xe2\x80\x94rather than with precision.  That rule and the result it produces in this case are irreconcilable with our decisions in <em>Lopez, supra</em>, and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U.

Accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Lopez</em>, we considered the constitutionality of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal offense \xe2\x80\x9cfor any individual knowingly to possess a firearm \xe2\x80\xa6 at a place the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(q)(2)(A).  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, <em>i.e.</em>, those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S., at 558\xe2\x80\x93559 (citation omitted).  This power derives from the conjunction of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  <em>Garcia</em> v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/469/528/index.html">469 U.

We held in <em>Lopez</em> that the Gun-Free School Zones Act could not be sustained as an exercise of that power.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision about whether gun possession in school zones substantially affected interstate commerce turned on four considerations.  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 559\xe2\x80\x93567; see also <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 609\xe2\x80\x93613.  First, we observed that our \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial effects\xe2\x80\x9d cases generally have upheld federal regulation of economic activity that affected interstate commerce, but that \xc2\xa7922(q) was a criminal statute having \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to do with \xe2\x80\x98commerce\xe2\x80\x99 or any sort of economic enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 561.  In this regard, we also noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ection 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.  It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, we noted that the statute contained no express jurisdictional requirement establishing its connection to interstate commerce.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, we found telling the absence of legislative findings about the regulated conduct\xe2\x80\x99s impact on interstate commerce.  We explained that while express legislative findings are neither required nor, when provided, dispositive, findings \xe2\x80\x9cenable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 563.  Finally, we rejected as too attenuated the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that firearm possession in school zones could result in violent crime which in turn could adversely affect the national economy.  <em>Id.</em>, at 563\xe2\x80\x93567.  The Constitution, we said, does not tolerate reasoning that would \xe2\x80\x9cconvert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 567.  Later in <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, we relied on the same four considerations to hold that \xc2\xa740302 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa713981, exceeded Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the case before us is materially indistinguishable from <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em> when the same considerations are taken into account.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is the relevant conduct subject to Commerce Clause analysis in this case?  The Court takes its cues from Congress, applying the above considerations to the activity regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in general.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rests on two facts about the CSA: (1) Congress chose to enact a single statute providing a comprehensive prohibition on the production, distribution, and possession of all controlled substances, and (2) Congress did not distinguish between various forms of intrastate noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841(a)(1), 844(a).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision suggests that the federal regulation of local activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge because Congress chose to act with an ambitious, all-encompassing statute, rather than piecemeal.  In my view, allowing Congress to set the terms of the constitutional debate in this way, <em>i.e.</em>, by packaging regulation of local activity in broader schemes, is tantamount to removing meaningful limits on the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s principal means of distinguishing <em>Lopez</em> from this case is to observe that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a \xe2\x80\x9cbrief, single-subject statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, see also <em>ante,</em> at 19, whereas the CSA is \xe2\x80\x9ca lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production, distribution, and possession of five classes of \xe2\x80\x98controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  Thus, according to the Court, it was possible in <em>Lopez </em>to evaluate in isolation the constitutionality of criminalizing local activity (there gun possession in school zones), whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this case cultivation and possession of marijuana for personal medicinal use) cannot be separated from the general drug control scheme of which it is a part.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision allows Congress to regulate intrastate activity without check, so long as there is some implication by legislative design that regulating intrastate activity is essential (and the Court appears to equate \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d) to the interstate regulatory scheme.  Seizing upon our language in <em>Lopez</em> that the statute prohibiting gun possession in school zones was \xe2\x80\x9cnot an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated,\xe2\x80\x9d 514 U. S., at 561, the Court appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a comprehensive scheme confirms that it is essential to that scheme.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  If the Court is right, then <em>Lopez</em> stands for nothing more than a drafting guide: Congress should have described the relevant crime as \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer or possession of a firearm anywhere in the nation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thus including commercial and noncommercial activity, and clearly encompassing some activity with assuredly substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Had it done so, the majority hints, we would have sustained its authority to regulate possession of firearms in school zones.  Furthermore, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision suggests we would readily sustain a congressional decision to attach the regulation of intrastate activity to a pre-existing comprehensive (or even not-so-comprehensive) scheme.  If so, the Court invites increased federal regulation of local activity even if, as it suggests, Congress would not enact a <em>new</em> interstate scheme exclusively for the sake of reaching intrastate activity, see <em>ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa033; <em>ante</em>, at 6 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot agree that our decision in <em>Lopez </em>contemplated such evasive or overbroad legislative strategies with approval.  Until today, such arguments have been made only in dissent.  See <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 657 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (given that Congress can regulate \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccan Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in a broader \xe2\x80\x98Safe Transport\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Worker Safety\xe2\x80\x99 act?\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em> did not indicate that the constitutionality of federal regulation depends on superficial and formalistic distinctions.  Likewise I did not understand our discussion of the role of courts in enforcing outer limits of the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the federalist balance our Constitution requires, see <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 557; <em>id.</em>, at 578 (Kennedy, J., concurring), as a signal to Congress to enact legislation that is more extensive and more intrusive into the domain of state power.  If the Court always defers to Congress as it does today, little may be left to the notion of enumerated\npowers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The hard work for courts, then, is to identify objective markers for confining the analysis in Commerce Clause cases.  Here, respondents challenge the constitutionality of the CSA as applied to them and those similarly situated.  I agree with the Court that we must look beyond respondents\xe2\x80\x99 own activities.  Otherwise, individual litigants could always exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regulation merely by pointing to the obvious\xe2\x80\x94that their personal activities do not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wirtz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/183/index.html">392 U. S. 183</a>, 193 (1968); <em>Wickard</em>, 317 U. S., at 127\xe2\x80\x93128.  The task is to identify a mode of analysis that allows Congress to regulate more than nothing (by declining to reduce each case to its litigants) and less than everything (by declining to let Congress set the terms of analysis).  The analysis may not be the same in every case, for it depends on the regulatory scheme at issue and the federalism concerns implicated.  See generally <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 567; <em>id</em>., at 579 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A number of objective markers are available to confine the scope of constitutional review here.  Both federal and state legislation\xe2\x80\x94including the CSA itself, the California Compassionate Use Act, and other state medical marijuana legislation\xe2\x80\x94recognize that medical and nonmedical (<em>i.e.</em>, recreational) uses of drugs are realistically distinct and can be segregated, and regulate them differently.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7812; Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa711362.5 (West Supp. 2005); <em>ante</em>, at 1 (opinion of the Court).  Respondents challenge only the application of the CSA to medicinal use of marijuana.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 20\xe2\x80\x9322 (1960) (describing our preference for as-applied rather than facial challenges).  Moreover, because fundamental structural concerns about dual sovereignty animate our Commerce Clause cases, it is relevant that this case involves the interplay of federal and state regulation in areas of criminal law and social policy, where \xe2\x80\x9cStates lay claim by right of history and expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also<em> Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 617\xe2\x80\x93619; <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute before us upsets the federal balance to a degree that renders it an unconstitutional assertion of the commerce power, and our intervention is required\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Garcia</em>, 469 U. S., at 586 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers\xe2\x80\x9d under the Commerce Clause).  California, like other States, has drawn on its reserved powers to distinguish the regulation of medicinal marijuana.  To ascertain whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 encroachment is constitutionally justified in this case, then, I would focus here on the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having thus defined the relevant conduct, we must determine whether, under our precedents, the conduct is economic and, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.  Even if intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for one\xe2\x80\x99s own medicinal use can properly be characterized as economic, and I question whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity substantially affects interstate commerce.  Similarly, it is neither self-evident nor demonstrated that regulating such activity is necessary to the interstate drug control scheme.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of economic activity is breathtaking.  It defines as economic any activity involving the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.  And it appears to reason that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating its market.  Putting to one side the problem endemic to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94the shift in focus from the activity at issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regulates, see <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 565 (\xe2\x80\x9cdepending on the level of generality, any activity can be looked upon as commercial\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definition of economic activity for purposes of Commerce Clause jurisprudence threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court uses a dictionary definition of economics to skirt the real problem of drawing a meaningful line between \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is national and what is local,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel</em>, 301 U. S., at 37.  It will not do to say that Congress may regulate noncommercial activity simply because it may have an effect on the demand for commercial goods, or because the noncommercial endeavor can, in some sense, substitute for commercial activity.  Most commercial goods or services have some sort of privately producible analogue.  Home care substitutes for daycare.  Charades games substitute for movie tickets.  Backyard or windowsill gardening substitutes for going to the supermarket.  To draw the line wherever private activity affects the demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and to declare everything economic.  We have already rejected the result that would follow\xe2\x80\x94a federal police power.  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 564.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>, we suggested that economic activity usually relates directly to commercial activity.  See <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 611, n.\xc2\xa04 (intrastate activities that have been within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate have been \xe2\x80\x9cof an apparent commercial character\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 561 (distinguishing the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 from \xe2\x80\x9cactivities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction\xe2\x80\x9d).  The homegrown cultivation and personal possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes has no apparent commercial character.  Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this case was never in the stream of commerce, and neither were the supplies for growing it.  (Marijuana is highly unusual among the substances subject to the CSA in that it can be cultivated without any materials that have traveled in interstate commerce.)  <em>Lopez</em> makes clear that possession is not itself commercial activity.  <em>Ibid</em>.  And respondents have not come into possession by means of any commercial transaction; they have simply grown, in their own homes, marijuana for their own use, without acquiring, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute now before us forecloses the States from experimenting \xe2\x80\xa6 and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce in the ordinary and usual sense of that term\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that <em>Wickard</em>, which we have identified as \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lopez, supra,</em> at 560,<em> </em>established federal regulatory power over any home consumption of a commodity for which a national market exists.  I disagree.  <em>Wickard</em> involved a challenge to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA), which directed the Secretary of Agriculture to set national quotas on wheat production, and penalties for excess production.  317 U. S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  The AAA itself confirmed that Congress made an explicit choice not to reach\xe2\x80\x94and thus the Court could not possibly have approved of federal control over\xe2\x80\x94small-scale, noncommercial wheat farming.  In contrast to the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s limitless assertion of power, Congress provided an exemption within the AAA for small producers.  When Filburn planted the wheat at issue in <em>Wickard</em>, the statute exempted plantings less than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he harvested his wheat it exempted plantings less than six acres.  <em>Id</em>., at 130, n.\xc2\xa030.  <em>Wickard, </em>then, did not extend Commerce Clause authority to something as modest as the home cook\xe2\x80\x99s herb garden.  This is not to say that Congress may never regulate small quantities of commodities possessed or produced for personal use, or to deny that it sometimes needs to enact a zero tolerance regime for such commodities.  It is merely to say that <em>Wickard </em>did not hold or imply that small-scale production of commodities is always economic, and automatically within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that economic activity is at issue in this case, the Government has made no showing in fact that the possession and use of homegrown marijuana for medical purposes, in California or elsewhere, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Similarly, the Government has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme.  Whatever the specific theory of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial effects\xe2\x80\x9d at issue (<em>i.e.</em>, whether the activity substantially affects interstate commerce, whether its regulation is necessary to an interstate regulatory scheme, or both), a concern for dual sovereignty requires that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 excursion into the traditional domain of States be justified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is why characterizing this as a case about the Necessary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis significantly.  Congress must exercise its authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent with basic constitutional principles.  <em>Garcia</em>, 469 U. S., at 585 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting)<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not enough that the \xe2\x80\x98end be legitimate\xe2\x80\x99; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).  As Justice Scalia recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 7 (opinion concurring in judgment), Congress cannot use its authority under the Clause to contravene the principle of state sovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Likewise, that authority must be used in a manner consistent with the notion of enumerated powers\xe2\x80\x94a structural principle that is as much part of the Constitution as the Tenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s explicit textual command.  Accordingly, something more than mere assertion is required when Congress purports to have power over local activity whose connection to an intrastate market is not self-evident.  Otherwise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will always be a back door for unconstitutional federal regulation.  Cf. <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a>, 923 (1997) (the Necessary and Proper Clause is \xe2\x80\x9cthe last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressional action\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, if it were enough in \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial effects\xe2\x80\x9d cases for the Court to supply conceivable justifications for intrastate regulation related to an interstate market, then we could have surmised in <em>Lopez</em> that guns in school zones are \xe2\x80\x9cnever more than an instant from the interstate market\xe2\x80\x9d in guns already subject to extensive federal regulation, <em>ante</em>, at 8 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), recast <em>Lopez</em> as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.  (According to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s and the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s logic, for example, the <em>Lopez</em> court should have reasoned that the prohibition on gun possession in school zones could be an appropriate means of effectuating a related prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9csell[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d firearms or ammunition to \xe2\x80\x9cany individual who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than eighteen years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(b)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. II).)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is simply no evidence that homegrown medicinal marijuana users constitute, in the aggregate, a sizable enough class to have a discernable, let alone substantial, impact on the national illicit drug market\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise to threaten the CSA regime.  Explicit evidence is helpful when substantial effect is not \xe2\x80\x9cvisible to the naked eye.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 563.  And here, in part because common sense suggests that medical marijuana users may be limited in number and that California\xe2\x80\x99s Compassionate Use Act and similar state legislation may well isolate activities relating to medicinal marijuana from the illicit market, the effect of those activities on interstate drug traffic is not self-evidently substantial.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this regard, again, this case is readily distinguishable from <em>Wickard</em>.  To decide whether the Secretary could regulate local wheat farming, the Court looked to \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual effects of the activity in question upon interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  317 U. S., at 120.  Critically, the Court was able to consider \xe2\x80\x9cactual effects\xe2\x80\x9d because the parties had \xe2\x80\x9cstipulated a summary of the economics of the wheat industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 125.  After reviewing in detail the picture of the industry provided in that summary, the Court explained that consumption of homegrown wheat was the most variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop, and that on-site consumption could have the effect of varying the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as 20 percent.  <em>Id</em>., at 127.  With real numbers at hand, the <em>Wickard </em>Court could easily conclude that \xe2\x80\x9ca factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions\xe2\x80\x9d nationwide.  <em>Id</em>., at 128; see also <em>id</em>., at 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis record leaves us in no doubt\xe2\x80\x9d about substantial effects).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record in the <em>Wickard</em> case itself established the causal connection between the production for local use and the national market\xe2\x80\x9d and argues that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have before us findings by Congress <em>to the same effect</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (emphasis added).  The Court refers to a series of declarations in the introduction to the CSA saying that (1) local distribution and possession of controlled substances causes \xe2\x80\x9cswelling\xe2\x80\x9d in interstate traffic; (2) local production and distribution cannot be distinguished from interstate production and distribution; (3) federal control over intrastate incidents \xe2\x80\x9cis essential to effective control\xe2\x80\x9d over interstate drug trafficking.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7801(1)\xe2\x80\x93(6).  These bare declarations cannot be compared to the record before the Court in <em>Wickard</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They amount to nothing more than a legislative insistence that the regulation of controlled substances must be absolute.  They are asserted without any supporting evidence\xe2\x80\x94descriptive, statistical, or otherwise.  \xe2\x80\x9c[S]imply because Congress may conclude a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hodel</em> v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/index.html">452 U. S. 264</a>, 311 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  Indeed, if declarations like these suffice to justify federal regulation, and if the Court today is right about what passes rationality review before us, then our decision in <em>Morrison</em> should have come out the other way.  In that case, Congress had supplied numerous findings regarding the impact gender-motivated violence had on the national economy.  529 U. S., at 614; <em>id</em>., at 628\xe2\x80\x93636 (Souter, J., dissenting) (chronicling findings).  But, recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we found Congress\xe2\x80\x99 detailed findings inadequate.  <em>Id., </em>at 614 (quoting <em>Lopez, supra,</em> at 557, n.\xc2\xa02, in turn quoting <em>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/241/index.html">379 U. S. 241</a>, 273 (1964) (Black, J., concurring)).  If, as the Court claims, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not break with precedent, how can it be that voluminous findings, documenting extensive hearings about the specific topic of violence against women, did not pass constitutional muster in <em>Morrison</em>, while the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s abstract, unsubstantiated, generalized findings about controlled substances do?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In particular, the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s introductory declarations are too vague and unspecific to demonstrate that the federal statutory scheme will be undermined if Congress cannot exert power over individuals like respondents.  The declarations are not even specific to marijuana.  (Facts about substantial effects may be developed in litigation to compensate for the inadequacy of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings; in part because this case comes to us from the grant of a preliminary injunction, there has been no such development.)  Because here California, like other States, has carved out a limited class of activity for distinct regulation, the inadequacy of the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s findings is especially glaring.  The California Compassionate Use Act exempts from other state drug laws patients and their caregivers \xe2\x80\x9cwho posses[s] or cultivat[e] marijuana for the <em>personal</em> medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation of a physician\xe2\x80\x9d to treat a list of serious medical conditions.  Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711362.5(d), 11362.7(h) (West Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).  Compare <em>ibid</em>. with, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa711357(b) (West 1991) (criminalizing marijuana possession in excess of 28.5 grams); \xc2\xa711358 (criminalizing marijuana cultivation).  The Act specifies that it should not be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in acts dangerous to others, or to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.  \xc2\xa711362.5(b)(2) (West Supp. 2005).  To promote the Act\xe2\x80\x99s operation and to facilitate law enforcement, California recently enacted an identification card system for qualified patients.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711362.7\xe2\x80\x9311362.83.  We generally assume States enforce their laws, see <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N.\xc2\xa0C., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 795 (1988), and have no reason to think otherwise here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has not overcome empirical doubt that the number of Californians engaged in personal cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana, or the amount of marijuana they produce, is enough to threaten the federal regime.  Nor has it shown that Compassionate Use Act marijuana users have been or are realistically likely to be responsible for the drug\xe2\x80\x99s seeping into the market in a significant way.  The Government does cite one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassionate Use Act users in California in 2004, Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, but does not explain, in terms of proportions, what their presence means for the national illicit drug market.  See generally <em>Wirtz</em>, 392 U. S., at 196, n.\xc2\xa027 (Congress cannot use \xe2\x80\x9ca relatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private activities\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> </em>cf. General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experience with Four States\xe2\x80\x99 Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 21\xe2\x80\x9323 (Rep. No. 03\xe2\x80\x93189, Nov. 2002), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03189.pdf (as visited June 3, 2005 and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (in four California counties before the identification card system was enacted, voluntarily registered medical marijuana patients were less than 0.5 percent of the population; in Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon, statewide medical marijuana registrants represented less than 0.05 percent of the States\xe2\x80\x99 populations).  It also provides anecdotal evidence about the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The Court also offers some arguments about the effect of the Compassionate Use Act on the national market.  It says that the California statute might be vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous physicians, that Compassionate Use Act patients may overproduce, and that the history of the narcotics trade shows the difficulty of cordoning off any drug use from the rest of the market.  These arguments are plausible; if borne out in fact they could justify prosecuting Compassionate Use Act patients under the federal CSA.  But, without substantiation, they add little to the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s conclusory statements about diversion, essentiality, and market effect.

This overreaching stifles an express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently.  If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have supported the Compassionate Use Act.  But whatever the wisdom of California\xe2\x80\x99s experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for experiment be protected in this case.

By holding that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause, the Court abandons any attempt to enforce the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s limits on federal power.  The majority supports this conclusion by invoking, without explanation, the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Regulating respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, however, is not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99 restrictions on the interstate drug trade.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.

The Clause\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commerce\xe2\x80\x99 consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 585 (Thomas, J., concurring).

Throughout founding-era dictionaries, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s notes from the Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers, and the ratification debates, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d is consistently used to mean trade or exchange\xe2\x80\x94not all economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated connection to trade or exchange.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Thomas, J., concurring); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112\xe2\x80\x93125 (2001).  The term \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d commonly meant trade or exchange (and shipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved in the drafting and ratification processes, but also to the general public.

Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume.  They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California\xe2\x80\x94it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial transaction.  Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce\xe2\x80\x9d included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value.  In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this traditional understanding of \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.

The CSA does not, however, criminalize only the interstate buying and selling of marijuana.  Instead, it bans the entire market\xe2\x80\x94intrastate or interstate, noncommercial or commercial\xe2\x80\x94for marijuana.  Respondents are correct that the CSA exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power as applied to their conduct, which is purely intrastate and noncommercial.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More difficult, however, is whether the CSA is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to enact laws that are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d its power to regulate interstate commerce.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.  The Necessary and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enact any law that bears some conceivable connection to the exercise of an enumerated power.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Nor is it, however, a command to Congress to enact only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this Court, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, set forth a test for determining when an Act of Congress is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 421.</p>\n<p align="left">\nTo act under the Necessary and Proper Clause, then, Congress must select a means that is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplainly adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to executing an enumerated power; the means cannot be otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by the Constitution; and the means cannot be inconsistent with \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter and spirit of the [C]onstitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> D.

The Government contends that banning Monson and Raich\xe2\x80\x99s intrastate drug activity is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d its regulation of interstate drug trafficking.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.  See 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(6).  However, in order to be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the intrastate ban must be more than \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable means [of] effectuat[ing] the regulation of interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 14; see <em>ante</em>, at 19 (majority opinion) (employing rational-basis review).  It must be \xe2\x80\x9cplainly adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to regulating interstate marijuana trafficking\xe2\x80\x94in other words, there must be an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious, simple, and direct relation\xe2\x80\x9d between the intrastate ban and the regulation of interstate commerce.  <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U.

Unregulated local growers and users could swell both the supply and the demand sides of the interstate marijuana market, making the market more difficult to regulate.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 19 (majority opinion).  But respondents do not challenge the CSA on its face.  Instead, they challenge it as applied to their conduct.  The question is thus whether the intrastate ban is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to medical marijuana users like respondents.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are not regulable simply because they belong to a large class (local growers and users of marijuana) that Congress might need to reach, if they also belong to a distinct and separable subclass (local growers and users of state-authorized, medical marijuana) that does not undermine the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s interstate ban.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  The Court of Appeals found that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9climited use is distinct from the broader illicit drug market,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cth[eir] medicinal marijuana \xe2\x80\xa6 is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Raich</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, 352 F.\xc2\xa03d 1222, 1228 (CA9 2003).  If that is generally true of individuals who grow and use marijuana for medical purposes under state law, then even assuming Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d reasons why regulating intrastate cultivation and possession is necessary to regulating the interstate drug trade, none of those reasons applies to medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s Compassionate Use Act sets respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct apart from other intrastate producers and users of marijuana.  The Act channels marijuana use to \xe2\x80\x9cseriously ill Californians,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa711362.5(b)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2005), and prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cthe diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa711362.5(b)(2).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  California strictly controls the cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes.  To be eligible for its program, California requires that a patient have an illness that cannabis can relieve, such as cancer, AIDS, or arthritis, \xc2\xa711362.5(b)(1)(A), and that he obtain a physician\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation or approval, \xc2\xa711362.5(d).  Qualified patients must provide personal and medical information to obtain medical identification cards, and there is a statewide registry of cardholders.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711362.715\xe2\x80\x93.76.  Moreover, the Medical Board of California has issued guidelines for physicians\xe2\x80\x99 cannabis recommendations, and it sanctions physicians who do not comply with the guidelines.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>People</em> v. <em>Spark</em>, 121 Cal. App. 4th 259, 263, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 840, 843 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This class of intrastate users is therefore distinguishable from others.  We normally presume that States enforce their own laws, <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 795 (1988), and there is no reason to depart from that presumption here: Nothing suggests that California\xe2\x80\x99s controls are ineffective.  The scant evidence that exists suggests that few people\xe2\x80\x94the vast majority of whom are aged 40 or older\xe2\x80\x94register to use medical marijuana.  General Accounting Office, Marijuana: Early Experiences with Four States\xe2\x80\x99 Laws That Allow Use for Medical Purposes 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (Rep. No. 03\xe2\x80\x93189, Nov. 2002), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01389.pdf (all Internet materials as visited on June 3, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  In part because of the low incidence of medical marijuana use, many law enforcement officials report that the introduction of medical marijuana laws has not affected their law enforcement efforts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These controls belie the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that placing medical marijuana outside the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s reach \xe2\x80\x9cwould prevent effective enforcement of the interstate ban on drug trafficking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 33.  Enforcement of the CSA can continue as it did prior to the Compassionate Use Act.  Only now, a qualified patient could avoid arrest or prosecution by presenting his identification card to law enforcement officers.  In the event that a qualified patient is arrested for possession or his cannabis is seized, he could seek to prove as an affirmative defense that, in conformity with state law, he possessed or cultivated small quantities of marijuana intrastate solely for personal medical use.  <em>People</em> v. <em>Mower</em>, 28 Cal. 4th 457, 469\xe2\x80\x93470, 49 P.\xc2\xa03d 1067, 1073\xe2\x80\x931075 (2002); <em>People</em> v. <em>Trippet</em>, 56 Cal. App. 4th 1532, 1549 (1997).  Moreover, under the CSA, certain drugs that present a high risk of abuse and addiction but that nevertheless have an accepted medical use\xe2\x80\x94drugs like morphine and amphetamines\xe2\x80\x94are available by prescription.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7812(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B); 21 CFR \xc2\xa71308.12 (2004).  No one argues that permitting use of these drugs under medical supervision has undermined the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even assuming that States\xe2\x80\x99 controls allow some seepage of medical marijuana into the illicit drug market, there is a multibillion-dollar interstate market for marijuana.  Executive Office of the President, Office of Nat. Drug Control Policy, Marijuana Fact Sheet 5 (Feb. 2004), http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/marijuana/index.html.  It is difficult to see how this vast market could be affected by diverted medical cannabis, let alone in a way that makes regulating intrastate medical marijuana obviously essential to controlling the interstate drug market.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, Congress declared that state policy would disrupt federal law enforcement.  It believed the across-the-board ban essential to policing interstate drug trafficking.  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7801(6).  But as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor points out, Congress presented no evidence in support of its conclusions, which are not so much findings of fact as assertions of power.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (dissenting opinion).  Congress cannot define the scope of its own power merely by declaring the necessity of its enactments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, neither in enacting the CSA nor in defending its application to respondents has the Government offered any obvious reason why banning medical marijuana use is necessary to stem the tide of interstate drug trafficking.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goal of curtailing the interstate drug trade would not plainly be thwarted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich.  That is, unless Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrastate possession and use of marijuana.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s ban on locally cultivated and consumed marijuana is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d that does not mean it is also \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d  The means selected by Congress to regulate interstate commerce cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited\xe2\x80\x9d by, or inconsistent with the \xe2\x80\x9cletter and spirit\xe2\x80\x9d of, the Constitution.  <em>McCulloch</em>, 4 Wheat., at 421.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Lopez</em>, I argued that allowing Congress to regulate intrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce Clause would confer on Congress a general \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power\xe2\x80\x9d over the Nation.  514 U. S., at 584, 600 (concurring opinion).  This is no less the case if Congress ties its power to the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Commerce Clause.  When agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Monson\xe2\x80\x99s home, they seized six cannabis plants.  If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Article I powers\xe2\x80\x94as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause\xe2\x80\x94have no meaningful limits.  Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to \xe2\x80\x9cappropria[te] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html"></a><a href="/us/529/598/index.html">529 U.

J. Const. L. 183, 186 (2003) (detailing statements by Founders that the Necessary and Proper Clause was not intended to expand the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers), Congress may not use its incidental authority to subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty.  <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U.

Further, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale\xe2\x80\x94that it may regulate the production or possession of any commodity for which there is an interstate market\xe2\x80\x94threatens to remove the remaining vestiges of States\xe2\x80\x99 traditional police powers.

Whatever additional latitude the Necessary and Proper Clause affords, <em>supra</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, the question is whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legislation is essential to the regulation of interstate commerce itself\xe2\x80\x94not whether the legislation extends only to economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.  <em>Supra</em>, at 4; <em>ante</em>, at 5 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the substantial effects test is malleable, because the majority expands the relevant conduct.  By defining the class at a high level of generality (as the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana), the majority overlooks that individuals authorized by state law to manufacture and possess medical marijuana exert no demonstrable effect on the interstate drug market.  <em>Supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The majority ignores that whether a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x94and thus comes within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reach on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach\xe2\x80\x94can turn on a number of objective factors, like state action or features of the regulated activity itself.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  For instance, here, if California and other States are effectively regulating medical marijuana users, then these users have little effect on the interstate drug trade.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The substantial effects test is easily manipulated for another reason.  This Court has never held that Congress can regulate noneconomic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.  <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 613 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hus far in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is <em>economic</em> in nature\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 560.  To evade even that modest restriction on federal power, the majority defines economic activity in the broadest possible terms as the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 23 (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 3d).  This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to federal regulation.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States.  This makes a mockery of Madison\xe2\x80\x99s assurance to the people of New York that the \xe2\x80\x9cpowers delegated\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government are \xe2\x80\x9cfew and defined,\xe2\x80\x9d while those of the States are \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous and indefinite.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even a Court interested more in the modern than the original understanding of the Constitution ought to resolve cases based on the meaning of words that are actually in the document.  Congress is authorized to regulate \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce,\xe2\x80\x9d and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct does not qualify under any definition of that term.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion only illustrates the steady drift away from the text of the Commerce Clause.  There is an inexorable expansion from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commerce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, to \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d activity, <em>ante</em>, at 20, and finally to all \xe2\x80\x9cproduction, distribution, and consumption\xe2\x80\x9d of goods or services for which there is an \xe2\x80\x9cestablished \xe2\x80\xa6 interstate market,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23.  Federal power expands, but never contracts, with each new locution.  The majority is not interpreting the Commerce Clause, but rewriting it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rewriting of the Commerce Clause seems to be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce Clause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress will be left powerless to regulate the national economy effectively.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316; <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 573\xe2\x80\x93574 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The interconnectedness of economic activity is not a modern phenomenon unfamiliar to the Framers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 590\xe2\x80\x93593 (Thomas, J., concurring); Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987).  Moreover, the Framers understood what the majority does not appear to fully appreciate: There is a danger to concentrating too much, as well as too little, power in the Federal Government.  This Court has carefully avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regulate <em>inter</em>state commerce, but it has casually allowed the Federal Government to strip States of their ability to regulate <em>intra</em>state commerce\xe2\x80\x94not to mention a host of local activities, like mere drug possession, that are not commercial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One searches the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in vain for any hint of what aspect of American life is reserved to the States.  Yet this Court knows that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U.

That is why today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will add no measure of stability to our Commerce Clause jurisprudence: This Court is willing neither to enforce limits on federal power, nor to declare the Tenth Amendment a dead letter.  If stability is possible, it is only by discarding the stand-alone substantial effects test and revisiting our definition of \xe2\x80\x9cCommerce among the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress may regulate interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x94not things that affect it, even when summed together, unless truly \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to regulating interstate commerce.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also inconsistently contends that regulating respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct is both incidental and essential to a comprehensive legislative scheme.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  I have already explained why the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s ban on local activity is not essential.  <em>Supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  However, the majority further claims that, because the CSA covers a great deal of interstate commerce, it \xe2\x80\x9cis of no moment\xe2\x80\x9d if it also \xe2\x80\x9censnares some purely intrastate activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an interstate market, according to the majority, it is free to regulate interstate and intrastate activity alike.  This cannot be justified under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause.  If the activity is purely intrastate, then it may not be regulated under the Commerce Clause.  And if the regulation of the intrastate activity is purely incidental, then it may not be regulated under the Necessary and Proper Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the majority terms this the \xe2\x80\x9cpivotal\xe2\x80\x9d distinction between the present case and <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  In <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>, the parties asserted facial challenges, claiming \xe2\x80\x9cthat a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power in its entirety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 20.  Here, by contrast, respondents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power as applied to their individual conduct.  According to the majority, while courts may set aside whole statutes or provisions, they may not \xe2\x80\x9cexcise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321<em>;</em> see also <em>Perez</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/146/index.html">402 U. S. 146</a>, 154 (1971); <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Wirtz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/183/index.html">392 U. S. 183</a>, 192\xe2\x80\x93193 (1968).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct is part of a \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities \xe2\x80\xa6 and that class is within the reach of federal power,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Perez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 154 (emphases deleted), then respondents may not point to the <em>de minimis</em> effect of their own personal conduct on the interstate drug market, <em>Wirtz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 196, n. 27.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting).  But that begs the question at issue: whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cclass of activities\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the reach of federal power,\xe2\x80\x9d which depends in turn on whether the class is defined at a low or a high level of generality.  <em>Supra</em>, at 5.  If medical marijuana patients like Monson and Raich largely stand outside the interstate drug market, then courts must excise them from the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  Congress expressly provided that if \xe2\x80\x9ca provision [of the CSA] is held invalid in one of more of its <em>applications</em>, the provision shall remain in effect in all its valid applications that are severable.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7901 (emphasis added); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 9, and n.\xc2\xa09) (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even in the absence of an express severability provision, it is implausible that this Court could set aside entire portions of the United States Code as outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power in <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>, but it cannot engage in the more restrained practice of invalidating particular applications of the CSA that are beyond Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power.  This Court has regularly entertained as-applied challenges under constitutional provisions, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (1960), including the Commerce Clause, see <em>Katzenbach</em> v. <em>McClung,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/294/index.html">379 U. S. 294</a>, 295 (1964); <em>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/241/index.html">379 U. S. 241</a>, 249 (1964); <em>Wickard</em> v. <em>Filburn,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/111/index.html">317 U. S. 111</a>, 113\xe2\x80\x93114 (1942).  There is no reason why, when Congress exceeds the scope of its commerce power, courts may not invalidate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 overreaching on a case-by-case basis.  The CSA undoubtedly regulates a great deal of interstate commerce, but that is no license to regulate conduct that is neither interstate nor commercial, however minor or incidental.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the majority is correct that <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em> are distinct because they were facial challenges to \xe2\x80\x9cparticular statute[s] or provision[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, then congressional power turns on the manner in which Congress packages legislation.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, Congress could not enact\xe2\x80\x94either as a single-subject statute or as a separate provision in the CSA\xe2\x80\x94a prohibition on the intrastate possession or cultivation of marijuana.  Nor could it enact an intrastate ban simply to supplement existing drug regulations.  However, that same prohibition is perfectly constitutional when integrated into a piece of legislation that reaches other regulable conduct.  <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 600\xe2\x80\x93601 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view\xe2\x80\x94that because <em>some</em> of the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s applications are constitutional, they must <em>all</em> be constitutional\xe2\x80\x94undermines its reliance on the substantial effects test.  The intrastate conduct swept within a general regulatory scheme may or may not have a substantial effect on the relevant interstate market.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne <em>always</em> can draw the circle broadly enough to cover an activity that, when taken in isolation, would not have substantial effects on commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 600 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The breadth of legislation that Congress enacts says nothing about whether the intrastate activity substantially affects interstate commerce, let alone whether it is necessary to the scheme.  Because medical marijuana users in California and elsewhere are not placing substantial amounts of cannabis into the stream of interstate commerce, Congress may not regulate them under the substantial effects test, no matter how broadly it drafts the CSA.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority prevents States like California from devising drug policies that they have concluded provide much-needed respite to the seriously ill.  It does so without any serious inquiry into the necessity for federal regulation or the propriety of \xe2\x80\x9cdisplac[ing] state regulation in areas of traditional state concern,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rush to embrace federal power \xe2\x80\x9cis especially unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/483/index.html">532 U. S. 483</a>, 502 (2001) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Our federalist system, properly understood, allows California and a growing number of other States to decide for themselves how to safeguard the health and welfare of their citizens.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It asserts that the CSA is constitutional even if California\xe2\x80\x99s current controls are effective, because state action can neither expand nor contract Congress\xe2\x80\x99 powers.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27, n. 38.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion is misleading.  Regardless of state action, Congress has the power to regulate intrastate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce (on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view) or activities that are necessary and proper to effectuating its commerce power (on my view).  But on either approach, whether an intrastate activity falls within the scope of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 powers turns on factors that the majority is unwilling to confront.  The majority apparently believes that even if States prevented any medical marijuana from entering the illicit drug market, and thus even if there were no need for the CSA to govern medical marijuana users, we should uphold the CSA under the <em>Commerce</em> Clause and the <em>Necessary</em> and Proper Clause.  Finally, to invoke the Supremacy Clause, as the majority does, <em>ibid.</em>, is to beg the question.  The CSA displaces California\xe2\x80\x99s Compassionate Use Act if the CSA is constitutional as applied to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct, but that is the very question at issue.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Other dictionaries do not define the term \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d as broadly as the majority does.
