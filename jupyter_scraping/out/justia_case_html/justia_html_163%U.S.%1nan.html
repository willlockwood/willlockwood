That all the plaintiff\'s lines in the State of Indiana, by reason of the proximity to supplies of material and the very cheap transportation, were of minimum value as compared with the plaintiff\'s lines situated elsewhere, and that by reason of these facts, the average mile of the telegraph line of the plaintiff within Indiana was of the value of forty percent of the value of the average mile of the whole line situated outside of the State of Indiana, reckoning such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 163 U.

The court sustained the demurrer and, the plaintiff declining to amend its bill, entered final judgment for the defendants.  The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Indiana, which affirmed the judgment.  141 Ind. 281.

S. 15</a></p><p> of the plaintiff, and by apportioning that valuation according to the proportion thereof within the State of Indiana, of all the plaintiff\'s telegraph lines everywhere, adopted an arbitrary rule and imposed an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>But in each of these respects, the case presented by this record appears to us to be governed by previous decisions of this Court.  The argument for the plaintiff in error, in effect if not in express words, invites the court to modify or to overrule those decisions.  It becomes important, therefore, to state somewhat fully the scope and extent of those decisions, the reasons on which they proceeded, and the provisions of the statutes thereby construed.</p>\n<p>The statutes of Massachusetts, the constitutionality of which was attacked by the present plaintiff and upheld by this Court in the two cases of <em>Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/530/case.html">125 U. S. 530</a></span>, and  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/141/40/case.html">141 U. S. 141</a></span> U.S. 40, were undistinguishable in any material respect from the statute of Indiana now before us, and may, as suggested at the bar, have been the model upon which this statute was framed.</p>\n<p>The material provisions of those statutes of Massachusetts were as follows:  every corporation chartered or organized in Massachusetts or elsewhere and owning a telegraph line in Massachusetts was required to return annually to the tax commissioner of the state a statement of the amount of its capital stock, the part value and market value of its shares, the locality and value of its real estate and machinery subject to local taxation within the state, the whole length of its lines, and the length of so much of its lines as was within the state.  The tax commissioner was required to ascertain the true market value of its shares and to estimate the fair cash valuation of all the shares constituting its capital stock, and the corporation was required to pay annually "a tax upon its corporate franchise at a valuation thereof equal to the aggregate value of the shares in its capital stock" as so determined by the tax commissioner, deducting, however, from that valuation such proportion thereof as was proportional to the length of that part of its line lying without the state, and also an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 163 U. S. 16</a></p><p> amount equal to the value, as determined by the tax commissioner, of its real estate and machinery within the state and subject to local taxation therein.  Mass.Pub.Stat. c. 13, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 38-40, 42.</p>\n<p>In the first of the Massachusetts cases, Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the Court, said that "the main ground on which the telegraph company resisted the payment of the tax alleged to be due" was that it was a violation of the rights conferred upon the company by the provisions (which had been accepted by the company) of the Act of Congress of July 24, 1866, c. 230, reenacted in section 5263 of the Revised Statutes, by which it was enacted that any telegraph company organized under the laws of any state should</p>\n<p>"have the right to construct, maintain and operate lines of telegraph through and over any portion of the public domain of the United States over and along any of the military or post roads of the United States . . . and over, under, or across the navigable streams or waters of the United States."</p>\n<p>14 Stat. 221; Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5263.  The argument then made by counsel, and the decision of the court upon this point are shown by the following passages in the opinion:</p>\n<p>"The argument is very much pressed that it is a tax upon the franchise of the company, which franchise, being derived from the United States by virtue of the statute above recited, cannot be taxed by a state, and counsel for appellant occasionally speak of the tax authorized by the law of Massachusetts upon this as well as all other corporations doing business within its territory, whether organized under its laws or not, as a tax upon their franchises.  But by whatever name it may be called, as described in the laws of Massachusetts, it is essentially an exercise upon the capital of the corporation.  The laws of that commonwealth attempt to ascertain the just amount which any corporation engaged in business within its limits shall pay as a contribution to the support of its government upon the amount and value of the capital so employed by it therein."</p>\n<p>125 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/530/case.html#546">125 U.

S. 17</a></p><p> roads or stop the use of them after they were placed there, nevertheless the company, receiving the benefit of the laws of the state for the protection of its property and its rights, is liable to be taxed upon its real or personal property as any other person would be.  It never could have been intended by the Congress of the United States, in conferring upon a corporation of one state the authority to enter the territory of any other state and erect its poles and lines the therein, to establish the proposition that such a company owned no obedience to the laws of the state into which it thus entered, and was under no obligation to pay its fair proportion of the taxes necessary to its support."</p>\n<p>125 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/530/case.html#548">125 U. S. 548</a></span>.</p>\n<p>"The tax in the present case, though nominally upon the shares of the capital stock of the company, is in effect a tax upon that organization on account of property owned and used by it in the State of Massachusetts, and the proportion of the length of its lines in that state to their entire length throughout the whole country is made the basis for ascertaining the value of that property.  We do not think that such a tax is forbidden by the acceptance on the part of the telegraph company of the rights conferred by section 5263 of the Revised Statutes or by the commerce clause of the Constitution."</p>\n<p>125 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/530/case.html#552">125 U.

S. 18</a></p><p> hold the tax void because the court might have adopted a different system had it been called upon to accomplish the same result, and decided that the rule adopted to ascertain the amount of the value of the capital engaged in business within the boundaries of the state, on which the tax should be assessed, was not an unfair or an unjust one, and that the details of the method by which this was determined did not exceed the fair range of legislative discretion.  125 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/530/case.html#553">125 U.

S. 44</a></span>-45.</p>\n<p>Those decisions clearly establish that a statute of a state requiring a telegraph company to pay a tax upon its property within the state, valued at such a proportion of the whole value of its capital stock as the length of its lines within the state bears to the length of all its lines everywhere, deducting a sum equal to the value of its real estate and machinery subject to local taxation within the state, is constitutional and valid notwithstanding that nothing is in terms directed to be deducted from the valuation either for the value of its franchises from the United States or for the value of its real estate and machinery situated and taxed in other states, unless there is something more showing that the system of taxation adopted is oppressive and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>We are then brought to a consideration of the statutes of Indiana, as construed by the supreme court of the state and by this Court.</p>\n<p>The Statute of Indiana of March 6, 1891, c. 91, repealed previous laws and established a comprehensive and complete system of taxation.  By \xc2\xa7 3, all property within the jurisdiction of the state not expressly exempted was declared to be subject to taxation, and by subsequent sections the property of all corporations owning or operating railroads within the state was classified for the purposes of taxation as follows:</p>\n<p>By \xc2\xa7 78, the</p>\n<p>"right of way, including the superstructure, main, side or second track, and turnouts, turntables, telegraph poles, wires, instruments and other appurtenances, and the stations and improvements of the railroad company on such right of way"</p>\n<p>(excepting machinery, fixtures, and stationary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 163 U. S. 19</a></p><p> engines), were considered real estate and denominated "railroad track."  By \xc2\xa7 79, the value of such "railroad track" was taxed in the several counties, townships, cities, and towns in the proportion that the length of the main track therein bore to the whole length of the road in the state, except that the value of the side or second track and of all turnouts, stationhouses, and other buildings belonging to the railroad was taxed in the county, township, city, or town in which they were situated.  By \xc2\xa7 80, the movable property belonging to a railroad company was denominated "rolling stock," and considered personal property, and was taxed in the several counties, townships, cities, and towns in the proportion that the main track used or operated therein bore to the length of the main track used or operated by the corporation, whether owned by it or not.  By \xc2\xa7 81, all other personal property, including machinery, fixtures, stationary engines, tools, and materials for repairs, was taxed in the county, township, city, or town in which it was on the first day of April in each year.  And by \xc2\xa7 82, all real estate of any railroad company other than that denominated "railroad track," with all improvements thereon, was taxed in the county, township, city, or town where it was situated.</p>\n<p>Each railroad corporation was required by \xc2\xa7 83 to return annually to the county auditor an inventory of all these kinds of property, except "railroad track," and by \xc2\xa7 85 to return to the auditor of the state, to be laid before the state board of tax commissioners, a statement showing, among other things --</p>\n<p>"First, the property denominated \'railroad track,\' giving the length of the main and side or second tracks and turnouts, and showing the proportions in each county and township, and the total in the state; second, the rolling stock, whether owned or hired, giving the length of the main track in each county, and the entire length of the road in this state,"</p>\n<p>and also the amount of its capital stock and the market value or, if no market value, the actual value, of its shares, the total amount of its indebtedness, except for current expenses, and the total listed valuation of all its tangible property in the state. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 163 U. S. 20</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 129, 137, the state board of tax commissioners was declared not to be bound by these returns, and was required to</p>\n<p>"appraise and assess all property at its true cash value, as defined by this act, according to their best knowledge and judgment and so as to equalize the assessment of property throughout the state,"</p>\n<p>and to "assess the railroad property denominated in this act as <em>railroad track\' and `rolling stock\' at its true cash value," and was authorized to examine persons and papers.  And by \xc2\xa7 130, each member of the board was required to declare, as part of his oath of office, that he would "in no case assess any property at more or less than its true cash value."\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court at the last term, in several cases affirming judgments of the Supreme Court of Indiana, held that the statute of 1891 did not, in the case of a railroad partly in that state and partly in another, require that the value of the part in Indiana should be determined absolutely by dividing the whole value upon a mileage basis, but only that the total amount of stock and indebtedness should be taken into consideration in ascertaining the value, and that the statute was constitutional.  <em>Pittsburgh &amp;c.

It is not necessary that every section of a tax act should in terms declare the scope of its territorial operation.  Before any statute will be held to intend to reach outside property, the language expressing such intention must be clear."</p>\n<p>154 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/421/case.html#428">154 U.

No intent to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 163 U.

Nevertheless it is ordinarily true that when a railroad consists of a single continuous line, the value of one part is fairly estimated by taking that part of the value of the entire road which is measured by the proportion of the length of the particular part to that of the whole road.

It is not bound to enter upon a disintegration of values, and attempt to extract from the total value of the entire property that which would exist if the miles of road within the state were operated separately.  Take the case of a railroad running from Columbus, Ohio, to Indianapolis, Indiana.  Whatever of value there may be resulting from the continuous operation of that road is partly attributable to the portion of the road in Indiana and partly to that in Ohio, and each state has an equal right to reach after a just proportion of that value, and subject it to its taxing processes.  The question is how can equity be secured between the states, and to that a division of the value of the entire property upon the mileage basis is the legitimate answer.

There is no pecuniary value outside of that which results from such use.

In the nature of things, it is practically impossible -- at least in respect to railroad property -- to divide its value and determine how much is caused by one use to which it is put and how much by another.  Take the case before us; it is impossible to disintegrate the value of that portion of the road within Indiana and determine how much of that value springs from its use in doing interstate business, and how much from its use in doing business wholly within the state.  An attempt to do so would be entering upon a mere field of uncertainty and speculation.  And because of this fact it is something which an assessing board is not required to attempt."</p>\n<p>154 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/439/case.html#445">154 U.

It is protected by state laws, and the rule of all property taxation is the rule of value, and by that rule property engaged in interstate commerce is controlled, the same as property engaged in commerce within the state.  Neither is this an attempt to do by indirection what cannot be done directly -- that is, to cast a burden on interstate commerce.  It comes rather within that large class of state action, like certain police restraints, which, while indirectly affecting, cannot be considered as a regulation of, interstate commerce or a direct burden upon its free exercise."</p>\n<p>154 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/439/case.html#446">154 U.

If testimony to this effect was presented by the company to the state board, it must be assumed in the absence of anything to the contrary that such board, in making the assessment of track and rolling stock within the state, took into account the peculiar and large value of such facilities and such extra rolling stock."</p>\n<p>154 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/421/case.html#431">154 U.

S. 25</a></p><p> lines in each county and township within the state.  By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6, 7, the state board of tax commissioners,</p>\n<p>"after examining such statements, and after ascertaining the value of such properties therefrom, and from such other information as they may have or obtain,"</p>\n<p>and requiring books and papers to be produced, and witnesses to be examined "in case they shall deem it necessary to enable them to ascertain the true cash value of such property," were required to value and assess the property of each company by ascertaining the true cash value of its entire property, for that purpose taking the aggregate value of its shares, if they had a market value, or, if they had none, the actual value thereof, or of the capital of the company; then, for the purpose of ascertaining the true cash value of the property within the state (first ascertaining and deducting the assessed value for taxation, in the localities where the same was situated, of its real estate outside the state, and not specifically sued in its general business), taking the proportion of the whole aggregate value of its property, as above ascertained, which the length of its lines within the state bore to the total length of its lines, and deducting therefrom the assessed value for taxation of real estate, machinery, and appliances within the state and subject to local taxation in the counties and townships.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Indiana considered the present case to be governed by the decisions of this Court in the cases of <em>Railroad Companies v. Backus,</em> above cited, and after referring to some of the passages above quoted from those decisions, added:</p>\n<p>"All that is thus forcibly and convincingly said as to the taxation of interstate railroad property is equally applicable to the taxation of interstate telegraph property.  It is not easy to see how one mile of appellant\'s telegraph line connecting Chicago with New York could be of less value than any other mile of the same line.  Cut out one mile, even though it be through a swamp or under a lake, and the value of the whole line is practically destroyed.  The property is a unit, valuable as a whole and by reason of its several connections and not by virtue of any part taken by itself.  No way, therefore, by which the value of the lines in this state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 163 U. S. 26</a></p><p> can be determined, seems so just and equitable as to take that proportion of the whole value which the mileage in this state bears to the whole mileage."</p>\n<p>141 Ind. 294, 295.</p>\n<p>In that court, as now in this, the telegraph company insisted that the statute of 1893, in applying the mileage basis of valuation to the lines of telegraph, compelled the state board of tax commissioners to add large outside values to the values of the Indiana portions of the lines, because the parts of the company\'s property outside the state were proportionately of greater value than the parts within the state, to which that court answered:</p>\n<p>"The act, it is true, provides a method of valuation -- the mileage method -- as a basis for the taxation of certain property within the State of Indiana.  But this is simply a means for determining the true cash value of the property within the state, and if in the case of appellant\'s property or in any other case it is shown to the board or is discovered by them that still further deductions should be made on account of larger proportional values outside of the state or for any other reason, then the board must make such deductions, so that finally only the property within the State of Indiana shall be assessed, and that at its true cash value."</p>\n<p>141 Ind. 297.</p>\n<p>The state court distinctly held that the statute of 1893, being supplementary to and amendatory of the statute of 1891, must be construed in connection therewith and be treated as part of one and the same general tax act; that the duties and powers of the state board of tax commissioners, as defined and prescribed in the statute of 1891, were not abridged or changed in any respect by the statute of 1893, and therefore, interpreting the statute of 1893 in the light of the provisions of the statute of 1891, which have been cited above, concluded</p>\n<p>"that in the act of 1893, the legislature provided the mileage method as the basis for the assessment of telegraph and other like property, both as to lines situated partly within and partly without this state and also as to lines running through several counties or other subdivisions of the state, but that it was not the intention of the legislature, nor is it the meaning of that act, that any property </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 163 U. S. 27</a></p><p> outside of the state should be assessed by importation of values or otherwise, or that any property should be assessed at more or less than its true cash value.  Construing the acts of 1891 and 1893 together, it will therefore be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the state board has deducted from the total valuation of all interstate property such values, if any, of extrastate property as will leave the remaining property, within and without the state, as near as may be of equal proportional value. . . .  The act of 1893 provides generally for a mode of ascertaining the true cash value of that part of interstate telegraph and other property which is within the State of Indiana, to-wit, the mileage method.  But should there be particular cases where that method must be modified in order to reach the necessary result, namely, the true cash value of such part of the property as is within the jurisdiction of the state, the law of 1893 itself supplies the means of doing so."</p>\n<p>141 Ind. 285, 297-300.</p>\n<p>The statute of Indiana of 1893 regarding telegraph companies, therefore, as construed and applied by the supreme court of the state, like the statute of 1891 regarding railroad companies, while it takes as the basis of valuation of the company\'s property within the state the proportion of the value of its whole capital stock which the length of its lines within the state bears to the whole length of all its lines, makes it the duty of the state board of tax commissioners to make such deductions, on account of a greater proportional value of the company\'s property outside the state, or for any other reason, as to assess its property within the state at its true cash value only, and is therefore governed by the same considerations upon which the provisions of the statute of 1891 for taxing railroad companies were held to be constitutional by the decisions of this Court in the <em>Indiana Railroad Cases,</em> above cited.</p>\n<p>The bill in the present case was filed before those decisions were rendered, and is so drawn as to make it somewhat difficult to distinguish matters of fact, alleged with such clearness and precision as to be admitted by the demurrer, from the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 163 U. S. 28</a></p><p> argumentative statements and the conclusions of law which are freely scattered throughout the bill.</p>\n<p>The bill alleges that the state board of tax commissioners, in fixing the valuation of the plaintiff\'s property in Indiana (deducting the value of real estate, machinery, and fixtures subject to local taxation within the state) at the sum of $2,297,652, and at the rate of $357 per mile of telegraph line, placed upon that property, beyond its true cash value, as measured by the cost of replacing the same, making reasonable allowances for deterioration, additional values of the plaintiff\'s business, property, and goodwill, both in and out of the state, and franchises granted by the United States, by the State of New York, and by foreign countries.  This allegation is made by way of preliminary and inducement to the concluding statement of the paragraph that, "in witness thereof," the tax commissioners entered upon their record a certificate and statement, which is set forth and which has no tendency to prove anything of the kind, but merely shows an assessment and valuation made by the state board of tax commissioners "after full consideration," and "in accordance with the act of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana approved March 6, 1893."  Moreover, the cost of the property, or of its replacement, is by no means a true measure of its value.  The bill, while it elsewhere states the value of the plaintiff\'s real estate in other states, and of its stocks and bonds of other companies, nowhere undertakes to fix the value of its franchises from the United States, the State of New York, and foreign countries, and the tax commissioners, by the authorities already cited, had the right and the duty, in estimating the value of the plaintiff\'s property in Indiana, to take into consideration those franchises and the other elements mentioned in this paragraph of the bill.</p>\n<p>The bill further alleges that the state board of tax commissioners did not attempt to specify or describe the plaintiff\'s real estate, machinery, and appliances subject to local taxation.  But the statute did not require of them any such specification or description, nor does the plaintiff appear to have requested them or to have done anything towards assisting them to do so. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 163 U. S. 29</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The bill then alleges that the commissioners took as a basis of their assessment the value of the plaintiff\'s entire capital stock, estimating the value of the shares according to the price of such shares in the stock exchange market in New York City, and dividing such aggregate value by the total number of miles of the plaintiff\'s telegraph lines, wherever situated, and thereby obtaining a pretended valuation of $357 per mile of its telegraph line in Indiana, which was "grossly excessive, and far beyond the true cash value of complainant\'s said property in Indiana."  But the bill immediately proceeds to allege that</p>\n<p>"said state board of tax commissioners, in reaching said valuation of complainant\'s said property in Indiana, did not consider and assess the value of the property of complainant situated in Indiana otherwise than by pursuing the requirements of said pretended statute."</p>\n<p>And the facts stated elsewhere in the bill demonstrate that the commissioners did not obtain their valuation by merely applying the rule stated in this paragraph.  Had they done so, the result would have been that the whole number of shares of stock, being 948,200 at $94.50 a share, would have been $89,594,900, which, divided by 189,576, the whole number of miles of all the plaintiff\'s lines, would give a value per mile of upwards of $472, or nearly one-third more than the valuation adopted.</p>\n<p>The bill further alleges that there was no market value for all the shares of the plaintiff\'s stock; that the price obtained for a very few shares in the New York Stock Exchange did not fairly represent the actual value of the plaintiff\'s property, and that any price at which any shares might be sold by holders thereof, whether calculated upon any market value or upon actual value, included a consideration of the plaintiff\'s franchises, its contracts with other companies, its actual past and probable future earnings from many sources, skill and enterprise of its managers, and all its real and personal estate in Indiana or elsewhere, including real estate of great value in other states, all which were</p>\n<p>"blended so as to render it impossible to separate and disintegrate the portions of value applicable to any and each of said elements of value of said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 163 U. S. 30</a></p><p> shares."</p>\n<p>This is hardly more than an argument to show the difficulty of ascertaining the cash value of the plaintiff\'s property in the State of Indiana.  It certainly has no tendency to show that the tax commissioners did not, as they were required to do by the statute, as since construed by the supreme court of the state, assess the plaintiff\'s property in Indiana at its true cash value according to their best knowledge and judgment and after making all proper deductions on account of larger proportional values of its property and business outside the state, or for any other reason.</p>\n<p>The remaining allegations of the bill are either repetitions or amplifications of those already considered or are averments of conclusions of law.  The allegation that</p>\n<p>"the attempted and pretended valuation of complainant\'s said property by said state board of tax commissioners in manner aforesaid . . . necessarily includes, and does in fact include, values which are no part of the true cash value of the property of complainant in Indiana,"</p>\n<p>is not equivalent to an assertion that the decision of the tax commissioners upon the question of fact committed by the statute to their determination was erroneous.  As said by this Court in <em>Pittsburgh &amp;c. Railway v. Backus,</em> above cited,</p>\n<p>"Whenever a question of fact is thus submitted to the determination of a special tribunal, its decision creates something more than a mere presumption of fact, and, if such determination comes into inquiry before the courts, it cannot be overthrown by evidence going only to show that the fact was otherwise than as so found and determined."</p>\n<p>154 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/154/421/case.html#434">154 U.
