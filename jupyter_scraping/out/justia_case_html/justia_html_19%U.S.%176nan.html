The schooner then proceeded to Talacuta, and having arrived off that place, a boat was sent ashore for information, the crew of which were made prisoners.  Concluding from this occurrence that the place was in possession of the Royalists, the schooner put to sea, and on 5 April fell in with a fleet </p><p><a class="page-number" name="179">Page 19 U.

The master having had communication with General Mina and received encouragement from him that he would purchase the cargo, the schooner kept company with the fleet and arrived off the bar of St. Ander on 28 April, where the schooner came to anchor in the open sea, the entrance being too shoal to permit her to cross the bar.</p>\n<p>On 11 May, the master left the schooner and went up the river to Porto La Marina (where General Mina had his headquarters) for the purpose of selling the cargo, which he accordingly did, deliverable to General Mina as he should want it from time to time at St. Ander, the whole delivery to be completed by the first of July.  On 18 May, while the master was on shore, a Spanish frigate and two armed schooners of the Royalists hove in sight and the schooner was immediately gotten under way for the purpose of escaping them, and after four hours\' chase effected her escape.  The schooner made several attempts to return, but was prevented by Spanish ships hovering about the place; on 26 May, finding the coast clear, she returned to St. Ander, which was still in possession of the Independents, and the master was taken on board.

The foremast was there repaired and the schooner sailed again for St. Ander for the purpose of delivering the cargo to General Mina according to contract, and on her arrival on 22 June, the place was found to be in possession of the royalists, who occupied it with a military force.

In consequence of this, the schooner did not approach the shore, but proceeded along the coast northward to a place called Pass Cavellos, about 270 miles from St. Ander, where information was received that St. Ander and the coast were completely in possession of the Royalists.

S. 184</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STORY delivered the opinion of the Court, and, after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p>Upon these facts, the circuit court directed the jury that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, and the propriety of this direction is the question before us upon this writ of error.</p>\n<p>Two points have been argued at the bar:  1. that there was no actual restraint of persons acting under the authority of Spain, whereby the voyage was defeated; 2. that if a technical total loss took place by the loss of the voyage, it was a loss occasioned by engaging in an illicit and prohibited trade, for which, by the memorandum in the policy, the underwriters are not liable.</p>\n<p>The declaration and the abandonment both tie up the case to a total loss of the voyage by the restraint of Spanish authorities.  If this case be not made out in proof, there is an end of the controversy. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 19 U. S. 185</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In cases of this sort, where a technical total loss is asserted as a ground of recovery, it is not sufficient that the voyage has been entirely frustrated and lost, but the loss must be occasioned by some peril actually insured against.  The peril must act directly, and not circuitously, upon the subject of the insurance.  It must be an immediate peril, and the loss the proper consequence of it, and it is not sufficient that the voyage be abandoned for fear of the operation of the peril.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs rely upon the fact of the <em>Ellen Tooker\'s</em> being chased away from St. Ander and being prevented for several days from returning to that place by the presence of Spanish armed ships as decisive proof of actual restraint.  But the voyage was delayed only, and not broken up by this occurrence, for the vessel afterwards returned in safety to St. Ander.  The insurers do not undertake that the voyage shall be performed without delay or that the perils insured against shall not occur; they undertake only for losses sustained by those perils, and if any peril does act upon the subject, yet if it be removed before any loss takes place, and the voyage be not thereby broken up, but is or may be resumed, the insured cannot abandon for a total loss.  If a vessel be captured during a voyage and afterwards be recaptured, and performs or may perform it, there can be no abandonment after the recapture for a technical total loss.  In the present case, the vessel actually did resume her voyage after the restraint ceased, and there is no evidence to show that any object of the voyage was defeated by this temporary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="186">Page 19 U. S. 186</a></p><p> restraint and delay to avoid capture.</p>\n<p>Then what was the real cause of the final destruction of the voyage?  It was that St. Ander, which but for a short time was in the possession of the troops of General Mina, was, <em>in transitu,</em> again occupied by the royalists, and the colonial government resumed its functions.  A trade was inhibited with that place by the ordinary colonial laws of Spain, and the voyage itself, in which the <em>Ellen Tooker</em> was engaged, placed her and her cargo also in the character of an enemy.  It was clear, therefore, that a proceeding into St. Ander, would have subjected the <em>Ellen Tooker</em> to confiscation for a double cause -- for breach of the ordinary laws of trade and for a violation of neutral duties.  The voyage then was broken up from fear of loss by reason of the seizure and confiscation of the property.  It was abandoned by the master <em>quia timebat,</em> and not because there was any actual direct restraint which prevented the vessel from proceeding to the port of destination.  The case therefore falls directly within the authority of the cases of <em>Hadkinson v. Robinson,</em> 3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 388, and <em>Lubbock v. Rowcroft,</em> 5 Esp. 50, which have never been shaken.  In the former case, Lord Alvanley said</p>\n<p>"any loss which necessarily arises from capture or detention of princes is a loss within the policy, but here the captain, learning that if he entered the port of destination the vessel would be liable to confiscation, avoided that port, whereby the object of the voyage is defeated.  This does not operate to the total destruction of the thing insured."</p>\n<p>There are precisely the same circumstances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 19 U. S. 187</a></p><p> in the case now at bar.  The underwriter does not warrant that the vessel shall have a right to trade at the port of destination, but only that notwithstanding the perils insured against, the vessel shall proceed to such port.  If the plaintiffs, in the events which have occurred, were entitled to abandon and recover as for a technical total loss, they would have been entitled to abandon for the same cause at the time of the vessel\'s sailing from New York on the voyage, for St. Ander was at that time just as much shut against the vessel, and she was just as liable to confiscation for illegal traffic with that place, as she was at the time the voyage was broken up.</p>\n<p><em>It is the unanimous opinion of the Court that the judgment of the circuit court be affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
