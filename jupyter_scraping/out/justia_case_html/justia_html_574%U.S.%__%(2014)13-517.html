After the jury returned a verdict for Shauers, one of the jurors contacted Warger\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, claiming that Regina Whipple, the jury foreperson, had revealed during deliberations that her daughter had been at fault in a fatal motor vehicle accident, and that a lawsuit would have ruined her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s life.  Armed with an affidavit from the juror, Warger moved for a new trial, arguing that Whipple had deliberately lied during voir\xc2\xa0dire about her impartiality and ability to award damages.  The District Court denied Warger\xe2\x80\x99s motion, holding that Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which bars evidence \xe2\x80\x9cabout any statement made .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. during the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations,\xe2\x80\x9d barred the affidavit, and that none of the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s three exceptions, see Rule 606(b)(2), were applicable.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir\xc2\xa0dire.

The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfederal rule\xe2\x80\x9d made jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if used to demonstrate dishonesty during voir\xc2\xa0dire.  Both the majority of courts and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Rule606(b) cases, see McDonald v. Pless, \n\n238 U.\xc2\xa0S. 264\n; Clark v. United States, \n\n289 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, favored this rule over the \xe2\x80\x9cIowa rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which permitted the use of such jury deliberations evidence.  The federal approach is clearly reflected in the language Congress chose when it enacted Rule 606(b), and legislative history confirms that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice was no accident.  See Tanner v.

It simply applies during a proceeding in which a verdict may be rendered invalid.

But that canon has no application here, where there is no ambiguity.  See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483\n.  Moreover, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Tanner decision forecloses any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional.  Similar to the right at issue in that case, Warger\xe2\x80\x99s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x99s removal of one means of ensuring unbiased jurors.  Even if a juror lies to conceal bias, parties may bring to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered and use nonjuror evidence after the verdict is rendered.

See Tanner, 483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 117.  Here, the excluded affidavit falls on the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d side.  Warger contends that any information Whipple shared with the other jurors was extraneous because she would have been disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s accident.  However, such an exception would swallow up much of the rest of the restrictive version of the common-law rule that Congress adopted in enacting Rule 606(b).

We hold that it does.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Gregory Warger was riding his motorcycle on a highway outside Rapid City, South Dakota, when a truck driven by respondent Randy Shauers struck him from behind.  Warger claims he was stopped at the time of the accident, while Shauers claims that Warger suddenly pulled out in front of him.  Regardless of the cause of the accident, no one disputes its tragic result: Warger sustained serious injuries that ultimately required the amputation of his left leg.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWarger sued Shauers for negligence in Federal District Court.  During jury selection, counsel for both parties conducted lengthy voir dire of the prospective jurors.  Warger\xe2\x80\x99s counsel asked whether any jurors would be unable to award damages for pain and suffering or for future medical expenses, or whether there was any juror who thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could be a fair and impartial juror on this kind of case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 105.  Prospective juror Regina Whipple, who was later selected as the jury foreperson, answered no to each of these questions.  See id., at 83, 89, 105.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tTrial commenced, and the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of Shauers.  Shortly thereafter, one of the jurors contacted Warger\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to express concern over juror Whipple\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The complaining juror subsequently signed an affidavit claiming that Whipple had spoken during deliberations about \xe2\x80\x9ca motor vehicle collision in which her daughter was at fault for the collision and a man died,\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9crelated that if her daughter had been sued, it would have ruined her life.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a\xe2\x80\x9341a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tRelying on this affidavit, Warger moved for a new trial.  He contended that Whipple had deliberately lied during voir dire about her impartiality and ability to award damages.  Thus, he asserted, he had satisfied the requirements of McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, \n\n464 U. S. 548 (1984)\n, which holds that a party may \xe2\x80\x9cobtain a new trial\xe2\x80\x9d if he \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[s] that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\xc2\xa0dire, and . . . that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 556.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe District Court refused to grant a new trial, holding that the only evidence that supported Warger\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the complaining juror\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit, was barred by Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b).  As relevant here, that Rule provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d evidence \xe2\x80\x9cabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations\xe2\x80\x9d is inadmissible.  Rule 606(b)(1).  The Rule contains three specific exceptions\xe2\x80\x94allowing testimony \xe2\x80\x9cabout whether (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form,\xe2\x80\x9d Rule 606(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x94but the District Court found none of these exceptions to be applicable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThe Eighth Circuit affirmed.  721 F. 3d 606 (2013).  It first held that Warger\xe2\x80\x99s proffered evidence did not fall within the \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous prejudicial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d exception set forth in Rule 606(b)(2)(A).  The court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[j]urors\xe2\x80\x99 personal experiences do not constitute extraneous information; it is unavoidable they will bring such innate experiences into the jury room.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 611.  Next, the court rejected Warger\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that Rule 606(b) is wholly inapplicable when a litigant offers evidence to show that a juror was dishonest during voir dire.  Acknowledging that there was a split among the Federal Courts of Appeals on this question, the Eighth Circuit joined those Circuits that had held that Rule 606(b) applies to any proceeding in which the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict might be invalidated, including efforts to demonstrate that a juror lied during voir dire.  Compare id., at 611\xe2\x80\x93612 (citing Williams v. Price, 343 F. 3d 223, 235\xe2\x80\x93237 (CA3 2003), and United States v. Benally, 546 F. 3d 1230, 1235 (CA10 2008)), with Hard v. Burlington N. R. Co., 812 F. 2d 482, 485 (CA9 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cStatements which tend to show deceit during voir dire are not barred by [Rule 606(b)]\xe2\x80\x9d), and Maldonado v. Missouri P.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co., 798 F.\xc2\xa02d 764, 770 (CA5 1986) (same).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now affirm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWe hold that Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.  In doing so, we simply accord Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x99s terms their plain meaning.  The Rule, after all, applies \xe2\x80\x9c[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 606(b)(1).  A postverdict motion for a new trial on the ground of voir\xc2\xa0dire dishonesty plainly entails \xe2\x80\x9can inquiry into the validity of [the] verdict\xe2\x80\x9d: If a juror was dishonest during voir\xc2\xa0dire and an honest response would have provided a valid basis to challenge that juror for cause, the verdict must be invalidated.  See McDonough, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 556.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tThis understanding of the text of Rule 606(b) is consistent with the underlying common-law rule on which it was based.  Although some common-law courts would have permitted evidence of jury deliberations to be introduced to demonstrate juror dishonesty during voir dire, the majority would not, and the language of Rule 606(b) reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of the more restrictive version of the common-law rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tRule 606(b) had its genesis in Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785), in which Lord Mansfield held inadmissible an affidavit from two jurors claiming that the jury had decided the case through a game of chance.  See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa72352, p. 696 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961).  The rule soon took root in the United States, id., at 696\xe2\x80\x93697, where it was viewed as both promoting the finality of verdicts and insulating the jury from outside influences, see McDonald v. Pless, \n\n238 U. S. 264\n\xe2\x80\x93268 (1915).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tSome versions of the rule were narrower than others.  Under what was sometimes known as the \xe2\x80\x9cIowa\xe2\x80\x9d approach, juror testimony regarding deliberations was excluded only to the extent that it related to matters that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inhere[d] in the verdict,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which generally consisted of evidence of the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 subjective intentions and thought processes in reaching a verdict.  3 C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \xc2\xa76:16, p. 70 (4th ed. 2013); 8 Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72353, 2354, at 699\xe2\x80\x93702.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  A number of courts adhering to the Iowa rule held that testimony regarding jury deliberations is admissible when used to challenge juror conduct during voir dire.  See, e.g., Mathi- sen v. Norton, 187 Wash. 240, 244\xe2\x80\x93246, 60 P. 2d 1, 3\xe2\x80\x934 (1936); Williams v. Bridges, 140 Cal. App. 537, 538\xe2\x80\x93541, 35 P. 2d 407, 408\xe2\x80\x93409 (1934).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tBut other courts applied a broader version of the anti-impeachment rule.  Under this version, sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d approach, litigants were prohibited from using evidence of jury deliberations unless it was offered to show that an \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous matter\xe2\x80\x9d had influenced the jury.  See 3 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \xc2\xa76:16, at 71; Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates, 56 F. R. D. 183, 265 (1973).  The \xe2\x80\x9cgreat majority\xe2\x80\x9d of appellate courts applying this version of the rule held jury deliberations evidence inadmissible even if used to demonstrate dishonesty during voir dire.  Wilson v. Wiggins, 54 Ariz. 240, 246, 94 P. 2d 870, 872 (1939); see, e.g., Willis v. Davis, 333 P. 2d 311, 314 (Okla. 1958); Turner v. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s Adm\xe2\x80\x99x, 252 S.

United States, \n\n225 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347\n\xe2\x80\x93384 (1912) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e think the rule expressed in Wright v. Illinois &amp; Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195 [1866], . . . should apply, that the testimony of jurors should not be received to show matters which essentially inhere in the verdict itself and necessarily depend upon the testimony of the jurors and can receive no corroboration\xe2\x80\x9d); Mattox v. United States, \n\n146 U.\xc2\xa0S. 140\n\xe2\x80\x93149 (1892) (quoting at length a Kansas Supreme Court decision setting out the Iowa test).  But to the extent that these decisions created any question as to which approach this Court followed, McDonald v. Pless largely settled matters.  There, we held that juror affidavits were not admissible to show that jurors had entered a \xe2\x80\x9cquotient\xe2\x80\x9d verdict, precisely the opposite of the result reached by the Iowa Supreme Court in its decision establishing the Iowa approach.  Compare 238 U. S., at 265, 268, with Wright v. Illinois &amp; Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195, 211\xe2\x80\x93212 (1866).  In doing so, we observed that although decisions in a few States made admissible a \xe2\x80\x9cjuror\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit as to an overt act of misconduct, which was capable of being controverted by other jurors,\xe2\x80\x9d the argument in favor of that approach (i.e., the Iowa rule) had not been generally accepted, because permitting such evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould open the door to the most pernicious arts and tampering with jurors.\xe2\x80\x9d  238 U.

S. 1 (1933)\n, was consistent with our apparent rejection of the Iowa approach.  In Clark, the Government had prosecuted for contempt a juror who, during voir\xc2\xa0dire in a prior case, had falsely denied knowing the defendant.  Id., at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  We held that the prosecution could introduce evidence of what had occurred during deliberations in the prior case, rejecting the juror\xe2\x80\x99s argument that these communications were privileged.  We were careful to explain, however, that nothing in our decision was \xe2\x80\x9cat variance with the rule . . . that the testimony of a juror is not admissible for the impeachment of his verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 18.  This was because the verdict in the original case was not at issue, and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule against impeachment [was] wholly unrelated to the problem . . . before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; accord, McDonald, 238 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 269.  Clark thus clarified that the rule against jurors\xe2\x80\x99 impeaching their verdicts applies only in a proceeding actually impeaching that verdict\xe2\x80\x94precisely the line Rule 606(b) draws when it refers to an \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry into the validity of a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tIn any event, these decisions predated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of Rule 606(b), and Congress was undoubtedly free to prescribe a broader version of the anti-impeachment rule than we had previously applied.  The language of the Rule it adopted clearly reflects the federal approach: As enacted, Rule 606(b) prohibited the use of any evidence of juror deliberations, subject only to the express exceptions for extraneous information and outside influences.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tFor those who consider legislative history relevant, here it confirms that this choice of language was no accident.  Congress rejected a prior version of the Rule that, in accordance with the Iowa approach, would have prohibited juror testimony only as to the \xe2\x80\x9ceffect of anything upon . . . [any] juror\xe2\x80\x99s mind or emotions . . . or concerning his mental processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Revised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates, 51 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 315, 387 (1971); see Tanner v. United States, \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107\n\xe2\x80\x93125 (1987) (detailing the legislative history of the Rule).  Thus Congress \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically understood, considered, and rejected a version of Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x9d that would have likely permitted the introduction of evidence of deliberations to show dishonesty during voir\xc2\xa0dire.  Id., at 125.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tSeeking to rebut this straightforward understanding of Rule 606(b), Warger first insists that the proceedings that follow a motion for new trial based on dishonesty during voir\xc2\xa0dire do not involve an \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry into the validity of the verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  His argument is as follows: Under McDonough, a party moving for a new trial on the basis of voir dire dishonesty need not show that this dishonesty had an effect on the verdict.  See 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 556.  Although a successful claim will result in vacatur of the judgment, vacatur is simply the remedy for the McDonough error, just as it may be the remedy for a variety of errors that have nothing to do with the manner in which the jury reached its verdict.  See, e.g., United States v. Davila, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12) (listing certain \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98structural\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d errors warranting \xe2\x80\x9cautomatic reversal\xe2\x80\x9d of a criminal conviction).  Therefore, Warger asserts, the \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry begins and ends with what happened during voir dire.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWe are not persuaded.  Warger, it seems, would restrict Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x99s application to those claims of error for which a court must examine the manner in which the jury reached its verdict\xe2\x80\x94claims, one might say, involving an inquiry into the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Rule refers is one into the \xe2\x80\x9cvalidity of the verdict,\xe2\x80\x9d not into the verdict itself.  The Rule does not focus on the means by which deliberations evidence might be used to invalidate a verdict.  It does not say \xe2\x80\x9cduring an inquiry into jury deliberations,\xe2\x80\x9d or prohibit the introduction of evidence of deliberations \xe2\x80\x9cfor use in determining whether an asserted error affected the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  It simply applies \xe2\x80\x9c[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of the verdict\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, during a proceeding in which the verdict may be rendered invalid.  Whether or not a juror\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct during voir dire had a direct effect on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, the motion for a new trial requires a court to determine whether the verdict can stand.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tNext, Warger contends that excluding jury deliberations evidence tending to show that a juror lied during voir\xc2\xa0dire is unnecessary to fulfill Congress\xe2\x80\x99 apparent objectives of encouraging full and open debate in the jury room and preventing the harassment of former jurors.  He observes that jurors remain free to, and may sometimes be forced to, disclose what happened in the jury room, and that ethical rules limit the ability of parties to harass jurors following trial.  But these are arguments against Rule 606(b) generally, not arguments for the particular exception to the Rule that Warger seeks.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of Rule 606(b) was premised on the concerns that the use of deliberations evidence to challenge verdicts would represent a threat to both jurors and finality in those circumstances not covered by the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s express exceptions.  Warger cannot escape the scope of the Rule Congress adopted simply by asserting that its concerns were misplaced.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tNor do we accept Warger\xe2\x80\x99s contention that we must adopt his interpretation of Rule 606(b) so as to avoid constitutional concerns.  The Constitution guarantees both criminal and civil litigants a right to an impartial jury.  See, e.g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, \n\n384 U. S. 333, \n362 (1966)\n; Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., \n\n328 U. S. 217, \n220 (1946)\n.  And we have made clear that voir dire can be an essential means of protecting this right.  See, e.g., Turner v. Murray, \n\n476 U. S. 28, \n36 (1986)\n (plurality opinion); Ham v. South Carolina, \n\n409 U. S. 524, \n527 (1973)\n.  These principles, Warger asserts, require that parties be allowed to use evidence of deliberations to demonstrate that a juror lied during voir dire.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tGiven the clarity of both the text and history of Rule 606(b), however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no role to play here.  The canon \xe2\x80\x9cis a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations\xe2\x80\x9d of a provision.  Clark v. Suarez-Martinez, \n\n543 U. S. 371, \n381 (2005)\n.  It \xe2\x80\x9chas no application in the absence of .\xc2\xa0. . ambiguity.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Cooperative, \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483, \n494 (2001)\n.  We see none here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tMoreover, any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional in circumstances such as these is foreclosed by our decision in Tanner.  In Tanner, we concluded that Rule 606(b) precluded a criminal defendant from introducing evidence that multiple jurors had been intoxicated during trial, rejecting the contention that this exclusion violated the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment right to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a tribunal both impartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U. S., at 126 (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, \n\n225 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, \n176 (1912)\n).  We reasoned that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to an unimpaired jury was sufficiently protected by voir\xc2\xa0dire, the observations of court and counsel during trial, and the potential use of \xe2\x80\x9cnonjuror evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of misconduct.  483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 127.  Similarly here, a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x99s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are unbiased.  Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured by the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ability to bring to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention any evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered, and to employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict is rendered.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWe further hold, consonant with the Eighth Circuit, that the affidavit Warger sought to introduce was not admissible under Rule 606(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s exception for evidence as to whether \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tGenerally speaking, information is deemed \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d if it derives from a source \xe2\x80\x9cexternal\xe2\x80\x9d to the jury.  See Tanner, 483 U. S., at 117.  \xe2\x80\x9cExternal\xe2\x80\x9d matters include publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide, while \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d matters include the general body of experiences that jurors are understood to bring with them to the jury room.  See id., at 117\xe2\x80\x93119; 27 C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \xc2\xa76075, pp. 520\xe2\x80\x93521 (2d ed. 2007).  Here, the excluded affidavit falls on the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d side of the line: Whipple\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x99s accident may well have informed her general views about negligence liability for car crashes, but it did not provide either her or the rest of the jury with any specific knowledge regarding Shauers\xe2\x80\x99 collision with Warger.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tIndeed, Warger does not argue that Whipple\xe2\x80\x99s statements related to \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d information in this sense.  Instead, he contends that because Whipple would have been disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s accident, any information she shared with the other jurors was extraneous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tWe cannot agree that whenever a juror should have been excluded from the jury, anything that juror says is necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Rule 606(b)(2)(A).  Were that correct, parties would find it quite easy to avoid Rule 606(b)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.  As discussed above, Congress adopted the restrictive version of the anti-impeachment rule, one that common-law courts had concluded precludes parties from using deliberations evidence to prove juror dishonesty during voir dire.  But if Warger\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d information exception were accepted, then any time a party could use such evidence to show that a juror\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect response [during voir\xc2\xa0dire] would have provided a valid basis for a challenge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a prerequisite for relief under McDonough, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 556\xe2\x80\x94all evidence of what that juror said during deliberations would be admissible.  The \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d information exception would swallow much of the rest of Rule 606(b).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tEven if such a result were not precluded by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 apparent intent to adopt the restrictive federal approach, it is foreclosed by Tanner, which relied upon the doctrine that \xe2\x80\x9ctreat[s] allegations of the physical or mental incompetence of a juror as \xe2\x80\x98internal\xe2\x80\x99 rather than \xe2\x80\x98external\xe2\x80\x99 matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U. S., at 118.  Tanner cited, in particular, cases holding that evidence of jurors\xe2\x80\x99 insanity, inability to understand English, and hearing impairments are all \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d matters subject to exclusion under Rule 606(b).  Id., at 119.  Were we to follow Warger\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous information\xe2\x80\x9d exception, all these cases, including Tanner, would have been wrongly decided: If the jurors were not able to serve on the jury in the first place, or should have been dismissed for their misconduct during the trial, then what they said or did during deliberations would necessarily be \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous\xe2\x80\x9d and admissible.  Tanner\xe2\x80\x99s implicit rejection of this view easily extends from the sort of juror incompetence considered in that case to the alleged bias considered here.  Whether a juror would have been struck from the jury because of incompetence or bias, the mere fact that a juror would have been struck does not make admissible evidence regarding that juror\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and statements during deliberations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\tFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0The Iowa rule derived from Wright v.
