On the occasion of the first of these transfers on short notice (apparently on October 8, 1970, from the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange to the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville), officers allegedly refused to give petitioner time to recover two books on auto mechanics which he had been compiling for two years. On the occasion of the second of these transfers ( apparently on August 14, 1972, back to the Reformatory), prison officials did not allow petitioner to recover a book in which he had alphabetized legal cases, laboring on weekends for a year.

This case may to some seem picayune. But basically it presents the substantial question of whether senseless, medieval practices of state officials can be \'immunized\' from the reach of the Civil Rights Act simply because they occur within the walls of prisons. See Sostre v. McGinnis, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/442/178/">442 F.2d 178</a> (CA2 1971). I would grant certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Since there is no jurisdiction for an appeal, this action should be treated as a petition for certiorari. 28 U.S.C. 2103. </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Apparently also on the occasion of the second transfer, petitioner was required by prison regulations to mail his personal belongings to somebody on the outside, who could then mail the items back to him after his transfer to the new institution. Coupled with a prison regulation which permits inmates to receive books only from publishing houses, this served to work a particular hardship on petitioner. He was forced to mail a book, which he had purchased from a publishing house while at the penitentiary, to a friend on the outside, but the friend was not able to mail it back to him at the Reformatory. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
