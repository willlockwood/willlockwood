At no time was Fields given Miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies.  As relevant here:  Fields was questioned for between five and seven hours; Fields was told more than once that he was free to leave and return to his cell; the deputies were armed, but Fields remained free of restraints; the conference room door was sometimes open and sometimes shut; several times during the interview Fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he did not ask to go back to his cell; after Fields confessed and the interview concluded, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for an escort and returned to his cell well after the hour when he generally retired.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court denied Fields\xe2\x80\x99 motion to suppress his confession under Miranda v. Arizona, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436\n, and he was convicted.  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Fields\xe2\x80\x99 contention that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without a Miranda warning.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan subsequently granted Fields habeas relief under 28  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the interview was a custodial interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, reasoning that Mathis v. United States, \n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), that isolation from the general prison population, combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such interrogation custodial per se.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld: \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the Sixth Circuit relied.  The Court has repeatedly declined to adopt any such rule.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Perkins, \n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 292\n.  The Sixth Circuit misread Mathis, which simply held, as relevant here, that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda because he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense.  It did not hold that imprisonment alone constitutes Miranda custody.  Nor does the statement in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o one questions that [inmate] Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purposes\xe2\x80\x9d support a per se rule.  It means only that the issue of custody was not contested in that case.  Finally, contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, Miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.

Stansbury v. California, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 318\n.  However, not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to Miranda custody.  See, e.g., Berkemer v. McCarty, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420\n.  Shatzer, distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and Miranda custody, held that a break in Miranda custody between a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment.  If a break in custody can occur, it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of Miranda. At least three strong grounds support this conclusion: Questioning a person who is already in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest; a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release; and a prisoner knows that his questioners probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence.  Thus, service of a prison term, without more, is not enough to constitute Miranda custody.

Taking a prisoner aside for questioning may necessitate some additional limitations on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of movement, but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into Miranda custody.  Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere and may be in his best interest.  Neither does questioning a prisoner about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls.  The coercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are asked.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t3.\xc2\xa0When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation.  The record in this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Miranda purposes.  While some of the facts lend support to his argument that Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s custody requirement was met, they are offset by others.  Most important, he was told at the outset of the interrogation, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go back to his cell whenever he wanted.  Moreover, he was not physically restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, average-sized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and was offered food and water.  These facts are consistent with an environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life behind bars.

Arizona, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966)\n, if the prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events that occurred outside the prison walls.  Our decisions, however, do not clearly establish such a rule, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in holding that this rule provides a permissible basis for federal habeas relief under the relevant provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),  \n28 U.

In order to get to the conference room, Fields had to go down one floor and pass through a locked door that separated two sections of the facility.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a, 69a.  Fields arrived at the conference room between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and was questioned for between five and seven hours.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the beginning of the interview, Fields was told that he was free to leave and return to his cell.  See id., at 70a.  Later, he was again told that he could leave whenever he wanted.  See id., at 90a.  The two interviewing deputies were armed during the interview, but Fields remained free of handcuffs and other restraints.  The door to the conference room was sometimes open and sometimes shut.  See id., at 70a\xe2\x80\x9375a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAbout halfway through the interview, after Fields had been confronted with the allegations of abuse, he became agitated and began to yell.  See id., at 80a, 125a.  Fields testified that one of the deputies, using an expletive, told him to sit down and said that \xe2\x80\x9cif [he] didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to cooperate, [he] could leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 89a; see also id., at 70a\xe2\x80\x9371a.  Fields eventually confessed to engaging in sex acts with the boy.  According to Fields\xe2\x80\x99 testimony at a suppression hearing, he said several times during the interview that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he did not ask to go back to his cell prior to the end of the interview.  See id., at 92a\xe2\x80\x9393a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen he was eventually ready to leave, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes or so because a corrections officer had to be summoned to escort him back to his cell, and he did not return to his cell until well after the hour when he generally retired.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  At no time was Fields given Miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State of Michigan charged Fields with criminal sexual conduct.  Relying on Miranda, Fields moved to suppress his confession, but the trial court denied his motion.  Over the renewed objection of defense counsel, one of the interviewing deputies testified at trial about Fields\xe2\x80\x99 admissions.  The jury convicted Fields of two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the judge sentenced him to a term of 10 to 15 years of imprisonment.  On direct appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Fields\xe2\x80\x99 contention that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without a Miranda warning.  The court ruled that Fields had not been in custody for pur- poses of Miranda during the interview, so no Miranda warnings were required.  The court emphasized that Fields was told that he was free to leave and return to his cell but that he never asked to do so.  The Michigan Supreme Court denied discretionary review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFields then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, and the court granted relief.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the interview in the conference room was a \xe2\x80\x9ccustodial interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Miranda because isolation from the general prison population combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison makes any such interrogation custodial per se.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that this Court clearly established in Mathis v. United States, \n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1968)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9cMiranda warnings must be administered when law enforcement officers remove an inmate from the general prison population and interrogate him regarding criminal conduct that took place outside the jail or prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  617 F.\xc2\xa03d 813, 820 (CA6 2010); see also id., at 818 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated, i.e.[,] questioned in a manner likely to lead to self-incrimination, about conduct occurring outside of the prison\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because Fields was isolated from the general prison population and interrogated about conduct occurring in the outside world, the Court of Appeals found that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by this Court in Mathis.  617 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 823.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari.  562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder AEDPA, a federal court may grant a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s application for a writ of habeas corpus if the state-court adjudication pursuant to which the prisoner is held \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).

On the contrary, we have repeatedly declined to adopt any categorical rule with respect to whether the questioning of a prison inmate is custodial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Illinois v.

Instead, we simply \xe2\x80\x9creject[ed] the argument that Miranda warnings are required whenever a suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses with someone who happens to be a government agent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 297.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMost recently, in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010), we expressly declined to adopt a bright-line rule for determining the applicability of Miranda in prisons.  Shatzer considered whether a break in custody ends the presumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v. Arizona, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477 (1981)\n, and, if so, whether a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s return to the general prison population after a custodial interrogation constitutes a break in Miranda custody.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934).

In Mathis, an inmate in a state prison was questioned by an Internal Revenue agent and was subsequently convicted for federal offenses.  The Court of Appeals held that Miranda did not apply to this interview for two reasons: A criminal investigation had not been commenced at the time of the interview, and the prisoner was incarcerated for an \xe2\x80\x9cunconnected offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mathis v. United States, 376 F.\xc2\xa02d 595, 597 (CA5 1967).  This Court rejected both of those grounds for distinguishing Miranda, 391 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 4, and thus the holding in Mathis is simply that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda by either of the two factors on which the Court of Appeals had relied.  Mathis did not hold that imprisonment, in and of itself, is enough to constitute Miranda custody.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Nor, contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s submission, see Brief for Respondent 14, did Oregon v.

Indeed, Miranda did not even establish that police questioning of a suspect at the station house is always custodial.  See Mathiason, supra, at 495 (declining to find that Miranda warnings are required \xe2\x80\x9csimply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, our decisions do not clearly establish that a prisoner is always in custody for purposes of Miranda whenever a prisoner is isolated from the general prison population and questioned about conduct outside the prison.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNot only does the categorical rule applied below go well beyond anything that is clearly established in our prior decisions, it is simply wrong.  The three elements of that rule\xe2\x80\x94(1) imprisonment, (2) questioning in private, and (3) questioning about events in the outside world\xe2\x80\x94are not necessarily enough to create a custodial situation for Miranda purposes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs used in our Miranda case law, \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art that specifies circumstances that are thought generally to present a serious danger of coercion.  In determining whether a person is in custody in this sense, the initial step is to ascertain whether, in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe objective cir- cumstances of the interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d Stansbury v. Califor- nia, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 318\n\xe2\x80\x93323, 325 (1994) (per\xc2\xa0curiam), a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thompson v.

Relevant factors include the location of the questioning, see Shatzer, supra, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9316), its duration, see Berkemer v.

Not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of Miranda.  We have \xe2\x80\x9cdecline[d] to accord talismanic power\xe2\x80\x9d to the freedom-of-movement inquiry, Berkemer, supra, at 437, and have instead asked the additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in Miranda.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur cases make clear .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the freedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for Miranda custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shatzer, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis important point is illustrated by our decision in Berkemer v. McCarty, supra.  In that case, we held that the roadside questioning of a motorist who was pulled over in a routine traffic stop did not constitute custodial interrogation.  Id., at 423, 441\xe2\x80\x93442.  We acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9ca traffic stop significantly curtails the \xe2\x80\x98freedom of action\xe2\x80\x99 of the driver and the passengers,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it is generally \xe2\x80\x9ca crime either to ignore a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s signal to stop one\xe2\x80\x99s car or, once having stopped, to drive away without permission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 436.  \xe2\x80\x9c[F]ew motorists,\xe2\x80\x9d we noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwould feel free either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the scene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Nevertheless, we held that a person detained as a result of a traffic stop is not in Miranda custody because such detention does not \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently impair [the detained person\xe2\x80\x99s] free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his consti- tutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 437.  As we later put it, the \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in- volved in a traffic stop or Terry stop does not constitute Miranda custody,\xe2\x80\x9d Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (citation omitted).  See Terry v. Ohio, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1968)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt may be thought that the situation in Berkemer\xe2\x80\x94the questioning of a motorist subjected to a brief traffic stop\xe2\x80\x94is worlds away from those present when an inmate is questioned in a prison, but the same cannot be said of Shatzer, where we again distinguished between restraints on freedom of movement and Miranda custody.  Shatzer, as noted, concerned the Edwards prophylactic rule, which limits the ability of the police to initiate further questioning of a suspect in Miranda custody once the suspect invokes the right to counsel.  We held in Shatzer that this rule does not apply when there is a sufficient break in custody between the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning.  See 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13-16).  And, what is significant for present purposes, we further held that a break in custody may occur while a suspect is serving a term in prison.  If a break in custody can occur while a prisoner is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment, it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of Miranda.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are at least three strong grounds for this conclusion.  First, questioning a person who is already serving a prison term does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest.  In the paradigmatic Miranda situation\xe2\x80\x94a person is arrested in his home or on the street and whisked to a police station for questioning\xe2\x80\x94detention represents a sharp and ominous change, and the shock may give rise to coercive pressures.  A person who is \xe2\x80\x9ccut off from his normal life and companions,\xe2\x80\x9d Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7), and abruptly transported from the street into a \xe2\x80\x9cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d Miranda, 384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456, may feel coerced into answering questions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, when a person who is already serving a term of imprisonment is questioned, there is usually no such change.  \xe2\x80\x9cInterrogated suspects who have previously been convicted of crime live in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shatzer, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  For a person serving a term of incarceration, we reasoned in Shatzer, the ordinary restrictions of prison life, while no doubt unpleasant, are expected and familiar and thus do not involve the same \xe2\x80\x9cinherently compelling pressures\xe2\x80\x9d that are often present when a suspect is yanked from familiar surroundings in the outside world and subjected to interrogation in a police station.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been sentenced to a term of incarceration, is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release.  When a person is arrested and taken to a station house for interrogation, the person who is questioned may be pressured to speak by the hope that, after doing so, he will be allowed to leave and go home.  On the other hand, when a prisoner is questioned, he knows that when the questioning ceases, he will remain under confinement.  Id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93 ___, n.\xc2\xa08 (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa08).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been convicted and sentenced, knows that the law enforcement officers who question him probably lack the authority to affect the duration of his sentence.  Id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315).  And \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the possibility of parole exists,\xe2\x80\x9d the interrogating officers probably also lack the power to bring about an early release.  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him, it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perkins, 496 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 297.  Under such circumstances, there is little \xe2\x80\x9cbasis for the assumption that a suspect . . . will feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of [a] more lenient treatment should he confess.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 296\xe2\x80\x93297.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, standard conditions of confinement and associated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate the same interests that the Court sought to protect when it afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to custodial interrogation.  Thus, service of a term of imprisonment, without more, is not enough to constitute Miranda custody.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe two other elements included in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule\xe2\x80\x94questioning in private and questioning about events that took place outside the prison\xe2\x80\x94are likewise insufficient.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaking a prisoner aside for questioning\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to questioning the prisoner in the presence of fellow inmates\xe2\x80\x94does not necessarily convert a \xe2\x80\x9cnoncustodial situation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to one in which Miranda applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mathiason, 429 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 495.  When a person who is not serving a prison term is questioned, isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere by preventing family members, friends, and others who may be sympathetic from providing either advice or emotional support.  And without any such assistance, the person who is questioned may feel overwhelming pressure to speak and to refrain from asking that the interview be terminated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove the prisoner from a supportive atmosphere.  Fellow inmates are by no means necessarily friends.  On the contrary, they may be hostile and, for a variety of reasons, may react negatively to what the questioning reveals.  In the present case, for example, would respondent have felt more at ease if he had been questioned in the presence of other inmates about the sexual abuse of an adolescent boy?  Isolation from the general prison population is often in the best interest of the interviewee and, in any event, does not suggest on its own the atmosphere of coercion that concerned the Court in Miranda.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true that taking a prisoner aside for questioning may necessitate some additional limitations on his freedom of movement.  A prisoner may, for example, be removed from an exercise yard and taken, under close guard, to the room where the interview is to be held.  But such procedures are an ordinary and familiar attribute of life behind bars.  Escorts and special security precautions may be standard procedures regardless of the purpose for which an inmate is removed from his regular routine and taken to a special location.  For example, ordinary prison procedure may require such measures when a prisoner is led to a meeting with an attorney.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, we fail to see why questioning about criminal activity outside the prison should be regarded as having a significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls.  In both instances, there is the potential for additional criminal liability and punishment.  If anything, the distinction would seem to cut the other way, as an inmate who confesses to misconduct that occurred within the prison may also incur administrative penalties, but even this is not enough to tip the scale in the direction of custody.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe threat to a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFifth Amendment rights that Miranda was designed to neutralize\xe2\x80\x9d is neither mitigated nor magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are asked.

These include the language that is used in summoning the prisoner to the interview and the manner in which the interrogation is conducted.  See Yarborough, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 665.

The following facts also lend some support to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s custody requirement was met: The interview lasted for between five and seven hours in the evening and continued well past the hour when respondent generally went to bed; the deputies who questioned respondent were armed; and one of the deputies, according to respondent, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]sed a very sharp tone,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and, on one occasion, profanity, see id., at 77a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese circumstances, however, were offset by others.  Most important, respondent was told at the outset of the interrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he could leave and go back to his cell whenever he wanted.

The court first observed: \xe2\x80\x9cThat a defendant is in prison for an unrelated offense when being questioned does not, without more, mean that he was in custody for the purpose of determining whether Miranda warnings were required.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added).  In this case, the court noted, the \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant was unquestionably in custody, but on a matter unrelated to the interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit concluded that the state court thereby limited Miranda in a way rejected by Mathis v. United States, \n, and \xe2\x80\x9ccurtail[ed] the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the person is in custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  We think the better reading is that the state court merely meant to draw a distinction between incarceration and Miranda custody.

But I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s further determination that Fields was not in custody under Miranda.  Were the case here on direct review, I would vote to hold that Miranda precludes the State\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of Fields\xe2\x80\x99s confession as evidence against him.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMiranda v. Arizona, \n\n384 U. S. 436 (1966)\n, reacted to police interrogation tactics that eroded the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on compulsory self-incrimination.  The opinion did so by requiring interrogators to convey to suspects the now-familiar warnings: The suspect is to be informed, prior to interrogation, that he \xe2\x80\x9chas a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 444.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder what circumstances are Miranda warnings required?

Given the reality that police interrogators \xe2\x80\x9ctrad[e] on the weakness of individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., their \xe2\x80\x9cinsecurity about [themselves] or [their] surroundings,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 455, the Court found the preinterrogation warnings set out in the opinion \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 469.  Those warnings, the Court elaborated, are \xe2\x80\x9can absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 468; they \xe2\x80\x9cinsure\xe2\x80\x9d that the suspect is timely told of his \n \nFifth Amendment privilege, and his freedom to exercise it, id., at 469.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFields, serving time for disorderly conduct, was, of course, \xe2\x80\x9ci[n] custody,\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of Miranda,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concludes.  Ante, at 14.  I would not train, as the Court does, on the question whether there can be custody within custody.  Instead, I would ask, as Miranda put it, whether Fields was subjected to \xe2\x80\x9cincommunicado interrogation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in a police-dominated atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d 384 U. S., at 445, whether he was placed, against his will, in an inherently stressful situation, see id., at 468, and whether his \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of action [was] curtailed in any significant way,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 467.  Those should be the key questions, and to each I would answer \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court acknowledges, Fields did not invite or consent to the interview.  Ante, at 14.  He was removed from his cell in the evening, taken to a conference room in the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s quarters, and questioned by two armed deputies long into the night and early morning.  Ibid.  He was not told at the outset that he had the right to decline to speak with the deputies.  Ibid.  Shut in with the armed officers, Fields felt \xe2\x80\x9ctrapped.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a.  Although told he could return to his cell if he did not want to cooperate, id., at 71a\xe2\x80\x9372a, Fields believed the deputies \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have allowed [him] to leave the room,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 72a.  And with good reason.  More than once, \xe2\x80\x9che told the officers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. he did not want to speak with them anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d  617 F.\xc2\xa03d 813, 815 (CA6 2010).  He was given water, App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a, but not his evening medications, id., at 79a.*  Yet the Court concludes that Fields was in \xe2\x80\x9can interrogation environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, \n\n541 U.

Never mind the facts suggesting that Fields\xe2\x80\x99s submission to the overnight interview was anything but voluntary.  Was Fields \xe2\x80\x9cheld for interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d?  See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471.  Brought to, and left alone with, the gun-bearing deputies, he surely was in my judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMiranda instructed that such a person \xe2\x80\x9cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Those warnings, along with \xe2\x80\x9cwarnings of the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against [the speaker],\xe2\x80\x9d Miranda explained, are necessary \xe2\x80\x9cprerequisite[s] to [an] interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d compatible with the \n \nFifth Amendment.  Ibid.  Today, for people already in prison, the Court finds it adequate for the police to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are free to terminate this interrogation and return to your cell.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a statement is no substitute for one ensuring that an individual is aware of his rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, I would hold that the \xe2\x80\x9cincommunicado interrogation [of Fields] in a police-dominated atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 445, without informing him of his rights, dishonored the \n \nFifth Amendment privilege Miranda was designed to safeguard.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Each night, Fields took an antidepressant and, due to his kidney transplant surgery, two antirejection medications.
