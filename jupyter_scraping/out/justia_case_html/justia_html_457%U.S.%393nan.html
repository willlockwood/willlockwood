The Act requires employers to pay an excise tax on wages paid to employees in "covered" employment, but entitles them to a credit on the federal tax for contributions paid into federally approved state unemployment compensation programs.  The Act, in 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3309(b), exempts from mandatory state coverage employees of, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<p>"an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches."</p>\n<p>A number of California churches and religious schools, including religious schools unaffiliated with any church, brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the Secretary of Labor from conditioning his approval of the California unemployment insurance program on its coverage of plaintiffs\' employees, and to enjoin the State from collecting both tax information and the state unemployment compensation tax.  The District Court conducted various proceedings and issued several opinions and orders extending over almost a year and a half, in one of which proceedings it rejected the Federal Government\'s argument that the court was barred from granting injunctive relief by the Tax Injunction Act, which provides that district courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain" the assessment or collection of any state tax where "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy" may be had in the courts of such State.  Ultimately, as pertinent here, on the ground that the benefit entitlement decisions for employees of the religious schools unaffiliated with churches risked excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the court permanently enjoined the state defendants from collecting unemployment taxes from such schools, but did not issue an injunction against the federal defendants as to the schools, because it had no information as to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 457 U. S. 394</a></p><p> what response the Secretary of Labor would make to the court\'s conclusion that the state defendants could not constitutionally impose state unemployment taxes on the employees of such schools.  The court said that, if the Secretary instituted decertification proceedings against California for failing to collect the taxes on behalf of such employees, the parties could apply to the court for further relief.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear these appeals under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1252, which permits appeals to this Court from a federal court judgment holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which the United States or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, is a party.  While the District Court did not expressly hold \xc2\xa7 3309(b) unconstitutional as applied to religious schools unaffiliated with churches, the effect of its several opinions and orders was to make "the United States or its officers . . . bound by a holding of unconstitutionality."  <em>McLucas v.

We do not reach this substantive question, however, holding instead that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to hear these challenges.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Last Term, in <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html">451 U. S. 772</a></span> (1981), this Court considered statutory and constitutional challenges to provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3301-3311 (1976 ed. and Supp. IV).  Because the present claims involve the same provisions that we interpreted in <em>St. Martin,</em> we recount only briefly the substance and legislative history of the relevant statutes before turning to the facts in the present cases.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In FUTA, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] Congress has authorized a cooperative federal-state scheme to provide benefits to unemployed workers.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 457 U. S. 397</a></p><p> The Act requires employers to pay an excise tax on wages paid to employees in "covered" employment, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] but entitles them to a credit of up to 90% of the federal tax for contributions they have paid into federally approved state unemployment compensation programs. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  One of the requirements for federal approval is that state programs "cover" certain broad categories of employment.</p>\n<p>Until 1970, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3306(c)(8) excluded from the definition of covered employment "service performed in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational, or other [tax exempt] organization."  Pub.L. 86-778, \xc2\xa7 533, 74 Stat. 984.  As a consequence, such organizations were not required to pay either federal excise taxes or state unemployment compensation taxes.  In 1970, Congress amended FUTA to require state plans to cover employees of nonprofit organizations, state hospitals, and state institutions of higher education, thus eliminating the broad exemption available to nonprofit organizations. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 3309(a)(1).  At the same time, Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 3309(b) to exempt from mandatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 457 U. S. 398</a></p><p> state coverage a narrow class of religious and educational employees, <em>i.e.,</em> Congress exempted services performed</p>\n<p>"(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or association of churches, or (B) an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches;"</p>\n<p>"(2) by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order;"</p>\n<p>"(3) in the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education."</p>\n<p>Pub.L. 91-373, \xc2\xa7 104(b)(1), 84 Stat. 698.</p>\n<p>In 1976, Congress again amended FUTA, this time eliminating the substance of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), thereby removing the blanket exemption for school employees.  <em>See</em> Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. 94-566, \xc2\xa7 115(b)(1), 90 Stat. 2670. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In order to maintain compliance with FUTA, the States promptly amended their corresponding state programs.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 634.5(a), (b) (West Supp.1982).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in these cases, a number of California churches and religious schools, sought to enjoin the Secretary of Labor from conditioning his approval of the California unemployment insurance program on its coverage of the plaintiffs\' employees, and to enjoin the State from collecting both tax information and the state tax. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  For the purposes of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 457 U. S. 399</a></p><p> evaluating their statutory and constitutional claims, the District Court divided the plaintiffs into three classes of employers:  Category I represents those schools that are part of the corporate structure of a church or association of churches; Category II includes schools that are separate corporations formed by a church or association of churches; and Category III includes schools that are</p>\n<p>"operated primarily for religious purposes, but which [are] not operated, supervised, controlled or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches, <em>i.e.,</em> an independent, non-church affiliated religious school."</p>\n<p>Supplemental Opinion, reprinted in App. to Juris.Statement in No. 81-31, p. 71 (J. S.  App.). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>On September 21, 1979, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the State, restraining it from collecting the state unemployment tax from the Category I plaintiffs.  <em>See id.</em> at 51.  The basis for the court\'s order was its conclusion that the plaintiffs were exempt from mandatory state coverage under \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1), and alternatively, that, if they were not exempt under the terms of FUTA, collection of the tax from the plaintiffs would involve excessive governmental entanglement with religion, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  <em>See</em> J.S.App. 58-65.</p>\n<p>In the same opinion, the District Court rejected the Federal Government\'s argument that, because the state remedy was "plain, speedy and efficient," the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, barred the court from granting injunctive relief.  Considering first the availability of injunctive relief </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 457 U. S. 400</a></p><p> from the state courts, the court concluded that state statutory and constitutional provisions [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] made such relief "at best, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 457 U. S. 401</a></p><p> uncertain."  J.S.App. 66.  The court then concluded that a state suit for a refund was an inadequate remedy because the plaintiffs claimed not only that their property had been taken unlawfully, but also that the "very process of determining whether any tax is due at all results in a violation of their First Amendment rights."  <em>Id.</em> at 67.  Because this First Amendment injury was "irreparable" once the taxes had been collected, only an injunction against collection of the tax could remedy the plaintiffs\' claims.  Accordingly, because there existed no "plain, speedy and efficient" remedy in the state courts, the District Court concluded that it had jurisdiction to grant injunctive and declaratory relief</p>\n<p>In a supplemental opinion filed June 2, 1980, the court clarified its earlier opinion, stating expressly that the preliminary injunction covered only Category I plaintiffs.  <em>See id.</em> at 71.  For the same reasons that it had granted the initial preliminary injunction, however, the court extended the preliminary injunction to Category II plaintiffs.  The court continued to deny relief to the Category III plaintiffs after concluding that they were not covered by the statutory exemptions in \xc2\xa7 3309(b) and that the risk of excessive governmental entanglement with religion was too small to violate the Establishment Clause.  J.S.App. 77-79. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 457 U. S. 402</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, on April 3, 1981, the court filed a second supplemental opinion ruling on all of the plaintiffs\' motions for permanent injunctions enjoining the State from collecting unemployment compensation taxes and the Federal Government from conditioning approval of the state unemployment compensation programs on their inclusion of the plaintiffs\' employees.  <em>See id.</em> at 1.  Considering first the statutory claims, the court concluded that Category I and Category II schools, but not Category III schools, are exempt from coverage under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3309(b) and the corresponding state provision, Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 634.5(a) (West Supp.1982).  J.S.App. 3-15. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The court also found that the benefit entitlement decisions for employees of Category III schools risk excessive governmental entanglement with religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  <em>Id.</em> at 25-33. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Consequently, the court held that "constitutional considerations bar the application of the scheme" to the Category III plaintiffs.  <em>Id.</em> at 33.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, the court issued orders permanently enjoining the federal defendants from requiring state unemployment insurance programs to cover Category I and Category II schools as a precondition for federal approval of the state programs, <em>id.</em> at 47, 51, and permanently enjoining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 457 U. S. 403</a></p><p> the state defendants from "collecting, or attempting to collect, unemployment compensation . . . taxes" from the Category I, II, or III schools.  <em>Id.</em> at 47, 50.  The court expressly held Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 634.5(a) (West Supp.1982) unconstitutional.  <em>See</em> J.S.App. 45, 46.  The court did not issue an injunction against the federal defendants as to Category III schools because it</p>\n<p>"has no information indicating what response, if any, the Secretary will make to the Court\'s conclusion that the state defendants may not constitutionally impose the state unemployment compensation tax scheme on the Category 3 employees of non-church affiliated schools. . . .

Consequently, the federal defendants, as well as the State defendants, have not appealed the District Court\'s injunction involving Category I and Category II schools, but only that part of the District Court order involving the Category III schools.

For example, while discussing the Establishment Clause claim of the Category III schools, the District Court held:</p>\n<p>"Since such entanglement [involving the resolution of questions of faith and doctrine by secular tribunals] is inevitable during the benefit eligibility determination process if religious schools are brought within the scope of the unemployment compensation tax <em>scheme,</em> constitutional considerations bar the <em>application</em> of the scheme to them."</p>\n<p>Second Supplemental Opinion, reprinted in J.S.App. 33 (emphasis added).  Examination of other portions of the court\'s opinion makes clear that the court\'s use of the word "scheme" refers to the combined federal and state provisions.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/21/case.html#26">421 U. S. 26</a></span> (expressly referring to both federal and state statutory provisions in discussing the "unemployment compensation scheme"); <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/21/case.html#25">421 U. S. 25</a></span> (referring to the intent of Congress and the California Legislature in discussing the "unemployment compensation tax scheme").  Moreover, the District Court\'s analysis leading to its order holding the California provision unconstitutional is based solely on its understanding of the operation and effect of FUTA, which, of course, prompted the passage of the corresponding state statute in the first place. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 457 U. S. 407</a></p><p> <em>Cf. St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church v.

S. 780</a></span>, n. 9 (holding that the Court could review the South Dakota Supreme Court\'s interpretation of its unemployment compensation tax statute because its "analysis depended entirely on its understanding of the meaning of FUTA and the First Amendment").  Finally, in its second supplemental opinion, the court made clear that, if the Secretary "institutes decertification proceedings against the State of California" for failing to collect unemployment compensation taxes on behalf of Category III employees, "the parties may apply to this Court for further relief," which can only mean injunctive relief against the Secretary.  J.S.App. 44, n. 39.  Under these circumstances, it is clear that the Secretary is "bound by a holding of unconstitutionality," and that this Court has jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1252 to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>As we noted above, the District Court declared Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 634.5(a) (West Supp.1982) unconstitutional and enjoined the state defendants from collecting state unemployment compensation taxes from the Category III schools. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  In the course of granting this declaratory and injunctive relief, the court expressly rejected the Federal Government\'s argument that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, deprived the court of jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> J.S.App. 65-69.  Consequently, before reaching the merits of the appellees\' claim, we must decide whether the District Court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction under the Tax Injunction Act to issue declaratory and injunctive relief</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Tax Injunction Act states simply that the district courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the . . . collection </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 457 U. S. 408</a></p><p> of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."</p>\n<p>It is plain from this language that the Tax Injunction Act prohibits a federal district court, in most circumstances, from issuing an injunction enjoining the collection of state taxes.  Although this Court once reserved the question, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] we now conclude that the Act also prohibits a district court from issuing a declaratory judgment holding state tax laws unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Initially, we observe that the Act divests the district court not only of jurisdiction to issue an injunction enjoining state officials, but also of jurisdiction to take actions that "suspend or restrain" the assessment and collection of state taxes.  Because the declaratory judgment "procedure may in every practical sense operate to suspend collection of the state taxes until the litigation is ended," <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/293/case.html">319 U.

S. 299</a></span> (1943), the very language of the Act suggests that a federal court is prohibited from issuing declaratory relief in state tax cases. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Additionally, because there is little practical difference between injunctive and declaratory relief, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that Congress intended to prohibit taxpayers from seeking one form of anticipatory relief against state tax officials in federal court while permitting them to seek another, thereby defeating the principal purpose of the Tax Injunction Act:  "to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 457 U. S. 409</a></p><p> as the collection of taxes."  <em>Rosewell v. LaSalle National Balk,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html">450 U.

After reviewing previous decisions [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] and the legislative history of the Act, [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] the Court concluded that the "plain, speedy and efficient" exception requires the "state court remedy [to meet] certain minimal <em>procedural</em> criteria."  450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html#512">450 U.

S. 412</a></p><p> (1974)). [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Applying these considerations, the <em>Rosewell</em> Court held that an Illinois tax scheme, requiring the taxpayer to pay an allegedly unconstitutional tax [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] and seek a refund through state administrative and judicial procedures, was a "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act.  In reaching this holding, the Court specifically relied on legislative Reports demonstrating congressional awareness that refunds were the exclusive remedy in many state tax systems. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The holding in <em>Rosewell</em> reflects not only Congress\' express command in the Tax Injunction Act, but also the historical reluctance of the federal courts to interfere with the operation of state tax systems if the taxpayer had available an adequate remedy in the state courts.  As this Court stated in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/108/case.html">Dows v. City of Chicago,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 108,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/108/case.html#110">78 U.

It must appear that the enforcement of the tax would lead to a multiplicity of suits, or produce irreparable injury, . . . before the aid of a court of equity can be invoked. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 457 U. S. 413</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In order to accommodate these concerns and be faithful to the congressional intent "to limit drastically" federal court interference with state tax systems, we must construe narrowly the "plain, speedy and efficient" exception to the Tax Injunction Act.</p>\n<p>With these cases and principles in mind, we turn to the California provisions to determine whether there exists a "plain, speedy and efficient" state remedy for the appellees\' claim.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>There is no dispute that appellees in the present cases can seek a refund of the California unemployment tax through state administrative and judicial procedures.  Once a taxpayer has sought from, and been denied a refund by, the appropriate state agency, <em>see</em> Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1176-1185 (West 1972 and Supp.1982), [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] he may file an action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 457 U. S. 414</a></p><p> in Superior Court for a refund of the taxes paid, raising all arguments against the validity of the tax.  Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 1241 (West Supp.1982).  If the taxpayer is unsuccessful at trial, he may appeal the decision to higher state courts and ultimately seek review in this Court.  Nothing in this scheme prevents the taxpayer from "rais[ing] any and all constitutional objections to the tax" in the state courts.  <em>Rosewell v. LaSalle National Bank,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html#514">450 U. S. 514</a></span>.  As the Court in <em>Rosewell</em> noted, the "Act contemplates nothing more."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html#516">450 U. S. 516</a></span>, n.19. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Moreover, assuming that the appellees\' constitutional claims are meritorious, an issue on which we express no view, there is every reason to believe that, once a state appellate court has declared the tax unconstitutional, the appropriate state agencies will respect that declaration.  <em>See Pacific Motor Transport Co. v. State Board of Equalization,</em> 28 Cal.App.3d 230, 236, 104 Cal.Rptr. 558, 562 (1972) (noting that while the "relief afforded may not <em>prevent or enjoin\' or otherwise hamper present or future tax assessment or collection effort . . . [i]t will be presumed that </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 457 U. S. 415</a></em></p><p><em> the governmental agency will respect a judicial declaration concerning a regulation\'s validity").  Accordingly, it appears that <em>Rosewell</em> is directly applicable to the present cases, and that the District Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appellees\' claims.\n</em></p>\n<p>The appellees contend, however, that the California refund procedures do not constitute a "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" because their claims can be remedied only by injunctive relief, and that such relief is unavailable in California courts to restrain the collection of state taxes.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  Injunctive relief is necessary, the appellees claim, because, prior to state judicial review, the employer must meet certain recordkeeping, registration, and reporting requirements, <em>see</em> Cal.Un.Ins.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1085, 1086, 1088, 1092 (West 1972 and Supp.1982), and potentially is subject to administrative benefit eligibility hearings [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] in violation of the appellees\' First Amendment rights.  The appellees thus fear that their constitutional rights will be violated before they have an opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of the unemployment tax scheme in state court.</p>\n<p>This argument is unpersuasive.  First, nothing in the California scheme precludes the appellees from challenging the unemployment tax before a benefit eligibility hearing is held for one of their former employees.  As soon as an employer makes its first payment to the state unemployment insurance fund, it may file for a refund and, after exhausting state administrative remedies, seek a judicial determination of the constitutionality of the tax. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  If the employer ultimately prevails </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 457 U. S. 416</a></p><p> on his constitutional argument, the state taxing authorities can be expected to respect that court\'s holding in future administrative proceedings.  <em>See Pacific Motor Transport Co. v. State Board of Equalization, supra,</em> at 236, 104 Cal.Rptr. at 562.  Thus, before any entanglement from the benefit eligibility hearings occurs, the appellees should be able to challenge the constitutionality of the state unemployment insurance taxes.</p>\n<p>Second, while an employer may be subject to some recordkeeping and reporting requirements, or even a benefit eligibility hearing, pending the resolution of its constitutional claims in state court, it will be subject to the same burdens even if it seeks relief from the federal courts.  Thus, whatever harm the appellees may suffer pending resolution of their constitutional claims, that harm is not reduced by seeking relief in federal court.  Stated differently, there are no apparent advantages to federal court relief that make state court remedies less than "plain, speedy and efficient." [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, we must keep in mind that, at the time that it passed the Tax Injunction Act, Congress was well aware that refund procedures were the sole remedy in many States for unlawfully collected taxes.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937); H.R.Rep. No. 1503, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).

[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Because we do not believe that Congress intended federal injunctions and declaratory judgments to disrupt state tax administration when state refund procedures are available, we decline to find an exception in the Tax Injunction Act for the appellees\' claims.

Thus, while Congress perceived declaratory judgments as a device to reduce federal court abuses associated with injunctions, Congress also recognized that declaratory relief would "settle controversies," S.Rep. No. 1005, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934), and permit the federal courts "the power to exercise in some instances preventive relief."  H.R.Rep. No. 1264, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>To be sure, in enacting the Tax Injunction Act, Congress considered primarily injunctions against state officials because that form of anticipatory relief was the principal weapon used by businesses to delay or avoid paying state taxes.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1937); 81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937) (remarks of Sen. Bone).  Moreover, it is arguable that Congress\' failure to mention the Declaratory Judgment Act, enacted only three years earlier, indicates that Congress intended the Tax Injunction Act to prohibit only federal injunctive relief.  Nevertheless, the legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act demonstrates that Congress worried not so much about the form of relief available in the federal courts as about divesting the federal courts of jurisdiction to interfere with state tax administration.</p>\n<p>Both the Senate and House Reports, as well as the congressional debates of the Act, expressly rely on the congressional purpose underlying the Johnson Act of 1934, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342, which divests the district courts of jurisdiction of any suit to "enjoin, suspend, or restrain the operation" of any public utility commission order.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, <em>supra,</em> at 2; H.R.Rep. No. 1503, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937); 81 Cong.Rec. 1415-1417 (1937) (remarks of Sen. Bone).  The legislative history of the Johnson Act, in turn, makes clear that its purpose was to prevent public utilities from going to federal district court to challenge state administrative orders or avoid state administrative and judicial proceedings.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Rep. No. 125, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1933) (in support of the Johnson bill, declaring that a utility "will be required, in all cases where a State has set up a public utility commission, to proceed before that commission if it has any complaint.  It can appeal from this State board to the State courts and, if it is dissatisfied with the final judgment of the supreme court of the State, it can take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States"); <em>id.</em> at 33 ("It is the jurisdiction which Congress has given to Federal courts to pass on matters of State regulation which holds up the laws of the States, prevents the officials of the States from doing their duty, and robs the people of the benefit which would accrue to them, if the commissions which they have set up by law in the various States were permitted to perform their duty"); H.R.Rep.

The nonprofit organizations are not required to choose the reimbursement method, however, and can make regular payments to the fund in advance of any employee\'s being discharged.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T34" name="F34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the state court remedy is plain, speedy and efficient is reenforced by our observation that it took the appellees in these cases over two years to obtain injunctive relief in federal court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent errs when it states, without authority, that the Tax Injunction Act is not applicable to these cases because of the "layers of review that must be exhausted in the California system."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/393/case.html#422">457 U. S. 422</a></span>, n. 4.  Certainly, nothing in the legislative history of the Act suggests that requiring a taxpayer to seek a refund first through administrative procedures makes the state remedy less than "plain, speedy and efficient."  Moreover, the legislative history of the Johnson Act, after which the Tax Injunction Act was modeled, <em>see</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22, <em>supra,</em> makes clear congressional intent that a state remedy is "plain, speedy and efficient" even though a utility must proceed first through administrative and then judicial proceedings in order to challenge the constitutionality of utility rates.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

Any employer required to pay state taxes in a manner allegedly violating the Equal Protection Clause, for example, might argue that the absence of state injunctive relief permitted the infliction of an irreparable injury that could be remedied only by a federal injunction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T37" name="F37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>We also reject the appellees\' argument to the extent that it assumes that the state courts will not protect their constitutional rights.  As we stated in another context:</p>\n<p>"[W]e are unwilling to assume that there now exists a general lack of appropriate sensitivity to constitutional rights in the trial and appellate courts of the several States.  State courts, like federal courts, have a constitutional obligation to safeguard personal liberties and to uphold federal law."</p>\n<p><em>Stone v.

Consequently, the state defendants reason, the Tax Injunction Act does not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellants State of California <em>et al.</em> 35.  The error in this argument is its premise; as <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html">451 U. S. 772</a></span> (1981), demonstrates, the Federal Government need not be a party in order for the appellees to litigate their statutory and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>Finally, none of the parties suggests that we avoid the jurisdictional bar of the Tax Injunction Act by restricting our review to the appellees\' challenge to 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3309(b), and disregarding their challenge to the corresponding state provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 634.5(a), (b).  Such a suggestion would be untenable since, after all, the state provisions were enacted in order to comply with federal statutory requirements, and consequently are identically worded to the federal provisions.  Thus, a challenge to FUTA would be a direct effort to "enjoin, suspend or restrain" state tax officials from collecting unemployment taxes from the appellees.  Alternatively, if the challenge to FUTA would not affect the actions of state officials, there would be serious doubts whether the appellees were injured by FUTA\'s provisions.  Accordingly, we vacate not only the District Court\'s judgment with respect to the appellees\' state claims, but also its judgment regarding the constitutionality of FUTA.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T39" name="F39">Footnote 39</a>]</p>\n<p>In both of those cases, the question was whether a single district judge or a three-judge district court had jurisdiction.  In the present cases, by contrast, the issue is whether the federal courts or the state courts have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T40" name="F40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, the state defendants\' reliance on <em>Williams v. Zbaraz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/358/case.html">448 U. S. 358</a></span> (1980), is misplaced.  In that case, the District Court had held unconstitutional a federal statute that the parties had not challenged.  We held that, because there was no case or controversy on that issue, the District Court had exceeded its jurisdiction for that issue.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/358/case.html#367">448 U.

Nevertheless, because of the holding of unconstitutionality, we concluded that we had jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1252 to "review the <em>whole case.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/358/case.html#368">448 U. S. 368</a></span>.  That review, however, was restricted to those issues over which the District Court had had jurisdiction, and we vacated that portion of the judgment holding the federal statute unconstitutional.  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Appellee Grace Brethren Church filed suit against the United States Secretary of Labor and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Central District of California claiming that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act violates the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  The District Court held the Act unconstitutional.  Pursuant to a federal statute providing for expedited review in cases of this kind, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] the defendants appealed directly to this Court, bypassing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 457 U. S. 420</a></p><p> the Court of Appeals precisely as Congress intended.  Recognizing the need for prompt review of a constitutional question affecting the nationwide operation of a federal statute, the Court holds that this special jurisdiction was properly invoked.  It then reaches the curious conclusion that, because some of the defendants are California taxing authorities that administer this cooperative federal-state program in that State, Congress intended that only state courts could pass on the constitutional validity of this federal statute. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Neither the language nor the legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act requires such a strange result.</p>\n<p>The Tax Injunction Act provides that federal district courts "shall not enjoin, suspend, or restrain" the activities of state taxing authorities.  The preclusion of federal injunctive relief was a response to a specific problem that concerned Congress in 1937.  In the States in which taxpayers were required to challenge a tax assessment in a refund suit, only taxpayers that could sue state taxing authorities in federal court could obtain injunctive relief.  The privileged taxpayers were primarily the foreign corporations that could invoke federal diversity jurisdiction.  These federal suits were objectionable not only because of this discrimination but also because state treasuries often were deprived of tax revenues while the federal suits were adjudicated and because the federal suits involved only state law questions that were more appropriate for state court resolution.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1937); 81 Cong.Rec. 1416-1417 (1937) (Sen. Bone); <em><span class="l-seealso">See also <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html">Rosewell v.

A literal reading of the Tax Injunction Act manifestly does not preclude the declaratory judgment entered in this litigation.  Nor do the concerns that gave rise to its enactment require such a bar.  Appellees\' challenge is based on the Federal Constitution, and is directed at a federal-state program administered according to federal requirements.  Only federal questions are involved.</p>\n<p>In <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/293/case.html">319 U. S. 293</a></span>, the Court recognized that equitable considerations can in some cases provide adequate justification for federal courts to withhold declaratory relief when the Tax Injunction Act precluded injunctive relief.  In the intervening 40 years, this equitable doctrine has been sufficient to protect state tax laws from unnecessary federal interference.  Today, however, the Court confronts a situation in which the challenge to a state tax does not implicate these concerns. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Ironically, the absence in these unusual cases of the traditional justification for a ban on declaratory relief seems to spur the Court to revise the Tax Injunction Act to preclude declaratory as well as injunctive relief.  To accomplish this revision, the Court must ignore the plain meaning of the statute and the limited concerns that gave rise to its enactment.  The Court instead relies upon the legislative history of the Johnson Act, ch. 283, 48 Stat. 775, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/393/case.html#409">457 U. S. 409</a></span>-410, n. 22, even though that statute was enacted before the Declaratory Judgment Act, ch. 512, 48 Stat. 955.  Even if that suspect analysis could be overlooked, the fact remains that, after the Declaratory Judgment Act was on the books for three years, Congress did not see fit to bar declaratory relief when it expressly precluded injunctive relief in the Tax Injunction Act.  The avoidance of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 457 U. S. 422</a></p><p> a decision on the merits in this litigation hardly seems worth the Court\'s nimble exercise in lawmaking. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has both the power and the duty to decide the merits.  I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1252 provides:</p>\n<p>"Any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory or final judgment, decree or order of any court of the United States . . . holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action, suit, or proceeding to which the United States or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is a party."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>A further irony is that the Secretary of Labor, who is certainly the principal defendant even if not an indispensable party, could remove such an action if it were filed in state court.  Indeed, with respect to one of the actions consolidated in the District Court, the Secretary did just that.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, to the extent that equitable considerations are implicated, they favor the procedure followed in these cases whereby expedited review in this Court is available.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>There is an independent reason why the Tax Injunction Act does not preclude federal declaratory relief in this litigation.  When one compares the layers of review that must be exhausted in the California system with the direct appeal to this Court provided by 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1252, one surely cannot conclude that the state system provides the "plain, speedy and efficient" remedy that Congress intended for the resolution of the federal questions these cases present.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
