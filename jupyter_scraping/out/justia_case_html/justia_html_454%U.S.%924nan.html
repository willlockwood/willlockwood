Because it remains apparent that this difficult issue of everyday importance to law enforcement officials and citizens on the street alike requires resolution here, I am again moved to note my dissent. The District of Columbia Police received an anonymous telephone call informing them that a young black man known as "Nicky" and wearing a blue jumpsuit had parked his 1971 Ford at No. 1 15th Street, N. E., entered a 1974 Oldsmobile, and driven away. The caller, who further identified the cars by color and license number, said that "Nicky" and the unidentified driver of the Oldsmobile were involved in narcotics traffic and would be " dirty" with drugs when they returned. The caller refused to identify himself or how he obtained this information. Upon receipt of the tip, two police officers, working out of uniform, established surveillance at the address given. They observed the Oldsmobile returning with a black male passenger in a blue sweatsuit, but saw no suspicious activity. The officers pulled their unmarked cruiser alongside the Oldsmobile partially blocking its access, displayed police identification, approached the car with guns drawn, and ordered the men, the petitioners in these cases, out of their automobile. Heroin and narcotics paraphernalia were subsequently discovered, leading to the men\'s arrest and conviction for possession of and intent to distribute heroin. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="925">Page 454 U.S. 924 , 925</a></p><p> A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the trial court\'s denial of petitioners\' motion to suppress the evidence seized from the Oldsmobile as the fruit of an invalid investigatory stop. 208 U.S.App.D.C. 289, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/648/29/">648 F.2d 29</a> (1981).

[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] It then concluded that the stop was valid because of the specificity of the descriptions provided and the verification of that information by the police.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="927">Page 454 U.S. 924 , 927</a></p><p> While I find the conflict in the federal and state courts sufficient reason to grant certiorari, the argument for doing so is especially strong when such uncertainty involves a fundamental aspect of law enforcement operations. Similar investigatory stops are conducted daily on the Nation\'s streets. Moreover, because of the lesser quantum of evidence required, Terry stops are likely to involve innocent citizens. Here, where not only is the detention on the "outermost perimeters of the Terry doctrine," 208 U.S.App.D.C., at 303, 648 F.2d, at 43, but also at the very intersection between brief stops and full-scale arrests, the overall judgment of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is very seriously drawn into question. Conversely, the "Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape." Adams v. Williams, supra, 407 U.S., at 145. Because clarification of the boundaries of legitimate police activity under the Constitution is ultimately this Court\'s responsibility, I would grant certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> The Government concedes that the tip did not provide probable cause for arrest at the time the officers approached the car. 208 U.S.App. D.C., at 292, 648 F.2d, at 32.
