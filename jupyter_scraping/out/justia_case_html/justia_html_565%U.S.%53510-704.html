She therefore requested police protection.  Two officers arrived, but they were called away to an emergency.  As soon as the officers left, Bowen showed up at the apartment, yelled \xe2\x80\x9cI told you never to call the cops on me bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a second-story landing.  After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave.  Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the car, blowing out one of its tires.   \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the incident.  She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former foster mother, Augusta Millender.  Following this conversation, Messerschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he confirmed Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s connection to the Millenders\xe2\x80\x99 home, verified his membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders\xe2\x80\x99 home for all firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang membership.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMesserschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his specialized training in gang-related crimes.  The second, expressly incorporated into the search warrant, described the incident and explained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the search.  It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night service because of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s gang ties.  Before submitting the application to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant and a deputy district attorney.  Messerschmidt then submitted the application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant.  The ensuing search uncovered only Millender\xe2\x80\x99s shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Millenders filed an action under \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 against petitioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the \n \nFourth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity from damages.  The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity.  The court held that the warrant\xe2\x80\x99s authorization was unconstitutionally overbroad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime, and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrant\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The officers are entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp. 8\xe2\x88\x9219.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0Qualified immunity \xe2\x80\x9cprotects government officials \xe2\x80\x98from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pearson v. Callahan, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223\n.  Where the alleged \n \nFourth Amendment violation involves a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner, or in \xe2\x80\x9cobjective good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Leon, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 897\n\xe2\x80\x93923.  Nonetheless, that fact does not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness.  The Court has recognized an exception allowing suit when \xe2\x80\x9cit is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Malley v. Briggs, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335\n.  The \xe2\x80\x9cshield of immunity\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where the warrant was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Leon, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 923.  The threshold for establishing this exception is high.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s probable-cause determination\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to determine whether the officer\xe2\x80\x99s allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the \n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Leon, supra, at 921.  Pp. 8\xe2\x88\x9210.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0This case does not fall within that narrow exception.  It would not be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was probable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.  Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer could reasonably conclude that there was a \xe2\x80\x9cfair probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v. Gates, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n, and that Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s sawed-off shotgun was illegal.  Cf. 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5845(a), 5861(d).  Given Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s possession of one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to kill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreasonable for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.  An officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly.  California law allows a magistrate to issue a search warrant for items \xe2\x80\x9cin the possession of any person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a public offense,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71524(a)(3), and the warrant application submitted by the officers specifically referenced this provision as a basis for the search.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Regarding the warrant\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to search for gang-related materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s attack as motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly but by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police.  It would therefore not be unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94based on the facts set out in the affidavit\xe2\x80\x94for an officer to believe that evidence of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges against Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting his defenses.  Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders\xe2\x80\x99 residence could demonstrate Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s control over the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.  Pp. 12\xe2\x88\x9216.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the warrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for the conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.  A contrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence were \xe2\x80\x9cplainly incompetent\xe2\x80\x9d in concluding that the warrant was supported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.  Pp. 16\xe2\x88\x9218.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(e)\xc2\xa0In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551\n.  There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe any of the items to be seized and \xe2\x80\x9ceven a cursory reading of the warrant\xe2\x80\x9d would have revealed this defect.  Id., at 557.  Here, in contrast, any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the supporting affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in the warrant.  Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that \xe2\x80\x9cjust a simple glance\xe2\x80\x9d would have revealed.  Id. at 564.

The warrant authorized a search for all guns and gang-related material, in connection with the investigation of a known gang member for shooting at his ex-girlfriend with a pistol-gripped sawed-off shotgun, because she had \xe2\x80\x9ccall[ed] the cops\xe2\x80\x9d on him.  App. 56.  Respondents brought an action seeking to hold the officers personally liable under \n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, alleging that the search violated their \n \nFourth Amendment rights because there was not sufficient probable cause to believe the items sought were evidence of a crime.  In particular, respondents argued that there was no basis to search for all  guns simply because the suspect owned and had used a sawed-off shotgun, and no reason to search for gang material because the shooting at the ex-girlfriend for \xe2\x80\x9ccall[ing] the cops\xe2\x80\x9d was solely a domestic dispute.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the warrant was invalid, and that the officers were not entitled to immu- nity from personal liability because this invalidity was so obvious that any reasonable officer would have recognized it, despite the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s approval.

Kelly feared an attack from Bowen, who had previously assaulted her and had been convicted of multiple violent felonies.  She therefore asked officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department to accompany her while she gathered her things.  Deputies from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department came to assist Kelly but were called away to respond to an emergency before the move was complete.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs soon as the officers left, an enraged Bowen appeared at the bottom of the stairs to the apartment, yelling \xe2\x80\x9cI told you never to call the cops on me bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 39, 56.  Bowen then ran up the stairs to Kelly, grabbed her by her shirt, and tried to throw her over the railing of the second-story landing.  When Kelly successfully resisted, Bowen bit her on the shoulder and attempted to drag her inside the apartment by her hair.  Kelly again managed to escape Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, and ran to her car.  By that time, Bowen had retrieved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.  He ran in front of Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s car, pointed the shotgun at her, and told Kelly that if she tried to leave he would kill her.  Kelly leaned over, fully depressed the gas pedal, and sped away.  Bowen fired at the car a total of five times, blowing out the car\xe2\x80\x99s left front tire in the process, but Kelly managed to escape.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKelly quickly located police officers and reported the assault.

Indeed, at the time of the investigation, Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crapsheet\xe2\x80\x9d spanned over 17 printed pages, and indicated that he had been arrested at least 31 times.

That affidavit described the facts of the incident involving Kelly and Bowen in great detail, including the weapon used in the assault.  The affidavit recounted that Kelly had identified Bowen as the assailant and that she thought Bowen might be found at 2234 East 120th Street.  It also reported that Messerschmidt had \xe2\x80\x9cconducted an extensive background search on the suspect by utilizing departmental records, state computer records, and other police agency records,\xe2\x80\x9d and that from that information he had concluded that Bowen resided at 2234 East 120th Street.

The affidavit concluded by noting that Messerschmidt \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve[d] that the items sought\xe2\x80\x9d would be in Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s possession and that \xe2\x80\x9crecovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and the curtailment of further crimes being committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMesserschmidt submitted the warrants to his super- visors\xe2\x80\x94Sergeant Lawrence and Lieutenant Ornales\xe2\x80\x94for review.  Deputy District Attorney Janet Wilson also reviewed the materials and initialed the search warrant, indicating that she agreed with Messerschmidt\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of probable cause.

As instructed by the police, the Millenders went outside while the residence was secured but remained in the living room while the search was conducted.  Bowen was not found in the residence.  The search did, however, result in the seizure of Augusta Millender\xe2\x80\x99s shotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBowen was arrested two weeks later after Messerschmidt found him hiding under a bed in a motel room.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Millenders filed suit in Federal District Court against the County of Los Angeles, the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department, the sheriff, and a number of individual officers, including Messerschmidt and Lawrence.

The District Court found the warrant defective in two respects.  The District Court concluded that the warrant\xe2\x80\x99s authorization to search for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime specified here was a physical assault with a very specific weapon\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip\xe2\x80\x94negating any need to \xe2\x80\x9csearch for all firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Millender v.

The court also found the warrant overbroad with respect to the search for gang-related materials, because there \xe2\x80\x9cwas no evidence that the crime at issue was gang-related.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 157.  As a result, the District Court granted summary judgment to the Millenders on their constitutional challenges to the firearm and gang material aspects of the search warrant.  Id., at 160.  The District Court also rejected the officers\xe2\x80\x99 claim that they were entitled to qualified immunity from damages.

The en banc court concluded that the warrant\xe2\x80\x99s authorization was unconstitutionally overbroad because the affidavit and the warrant failed to \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ ] probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material described in the warrant were contraband or evidence of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1033.  In the en banc court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cthe deputies had probable cause to search for a single, identified weapon . . . .  They had no probable cause to search for the broad class of firearms and firearm-related materials described in the warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1027.  In addition, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause the deputies failed to establish any link between gang-related materials and a crime, the warrant authorizing the search and seizure of all gang-related evidence [was] likewise invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1031.  Concluding that \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable officer in the deputies\xe2\x80\x99 position would have been well aware of this deficiency,\xe2\x80\x9d the en banc court held that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity.

She also concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers reasonably relied on their superiors, the district attorney, and the magistrate to correct\xe2\x80\x9d any overbreadth in the warrant, and that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because their actions were not objectively unreasonable.

Evidence of one crime is not always evidence of several, but given Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s possession of one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness to use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about the police, a reasonable officer could conclude that there would be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen owned.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the firearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly.

Cf. post, at 5 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Messerschmidt began his affidavit in support of the warrant by explaining that he \xe2\x80\x9chas been investigating an assault with a deadly weapon incident\xe2\x80\x9d and elaborated that the crime was a \xe2\x80\x9cspousal assault and an assault with a deadly weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 55 (emphasis added).  The affidavit also stated that Bowen was \xe2\x80\x9ca known Mona Park Crip gang member\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbased on information provided by the victim and the cal-gang database,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and that he had attempted to murder Kelly after becoming enraged that she had \xe2\x80\x9ccall[ed] the cops on [him].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 56, 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  A reasonable officer could certainly view Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s attack as motivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly but instead by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police.  She was, after all, no longer linked with him as a girlfriend; he had assaulted her in the past; and she had indeed called the cops on him.  And, as the affidavit supporting the warrant made clear, Kelly had in fact given the police information about Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s gang ties.

Hayden, \n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 294, \n307 (1967)\n (holding that the \n \nFourth Amendment allows a search for evidence when there is \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause . . . to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Not only would such evidence help to establish motive, either apart from or in addition to any domestic dispute, it would also support the bringing of additional, related charges against Bowen for the assault.  See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7136.1(b)(1) (West 1999) (It is a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cattempt[ ] to prevent or dissuade another person who has been the victim of a crime or who is witness to a crime from . . .

For example, evidence that Bowen had ties to a gang that uses guns such as the one he used to assault Kelly would certainly be relevant to establish that he had familiarity with or access to this type of weapon.   \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders\xe2\x80\x99 residence would aid in the prosecution of Bowen by, for example, demonstrating Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s connection to other evidence found there.  The warrant authorized a search for \xe2\x80\x9cany gang indicia that would establish the persons being sought in this warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[a]rticles of personal property tending to establish the identity of [the] person in control of the premise or premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 52.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 158\xe2\x80\x93159 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s known gang affiliation, a reasonable officer could conclude that gang paraphernalia found at the residence would be an effective means of demonstrating Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s control over the premises or his connection to evidence found there.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhatever the use to which evidence of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s gang involvement might ultimately have been put, it would not have been \xe2\x80\x9centirely unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d for an officer to believe that the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair probability that such evidence would aid the prosecution of Bowen for the criminal acts at issue.

Ibid.  Before seeking to have the warrant issued by a magistrate, Messerschmidt conducted an extensive investigation into Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s background and the facts of the crime.  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt prepared a detailed warrant application that truthfully laid out the pertinent facts.  The only facts omitted\xe2\x80\x94the offi- cers\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and conviction records, see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x94would only have strengthened the warrant.  Messerschmidt then submitted the warrant application for review by Lawrence, another superior officer, and a deputy district attorney, all of whom approved the application without any apparent misgivings.  Only after this did Messerschmidt seek the approval of a neutral magistrate, who issued the requested warrant.  The officers thus \xe2\x80\x9ctook every step that could reasonably be expected of them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Massachusetts v. Sheppard, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 981, \n989 (1984)\n.  In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that \xe2\x80\x9cno officer of reasonable competence would have requested the warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Malley, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 346, n.\xc2\xa09.  Indeed, a contrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence were \xe2\x80\x9cplainly incompetent,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 341, but that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.        \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals, however, gave no weight to the fact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved by the officers\xe2\x80\x99 superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral magistrate.  Relying on Malley, the court held that the officers had an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent responsibility to ensure there [was] at least a colorable argument for probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  620 F. 3d, at 1034.  It explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he deputies here had a responsibility to exercise their reasonable professional judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cin circumstances such as these a neutral magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s approval (and, a\xc2\xa0fortiori, a non-neutral prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s) cannot absolve an officer of liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe rejected in Malley the contention that an officer is automatically entitled to qualified immunity for seeking a warrant unsupported by probable cause, simply because a magistrate had approved the application.  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 345.  And because the officers\xe2\x80\x99 superior and the deputy district attorney are part of the prosecution team, their review also cannot be regarded as dispositive.  But by holding in Malley that a magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s approval does not automatically render an officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct reasonable, we did not suggest that approval by a magistrate or review by others is irrelevant to the objective reasonableness of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the warrant was valid.  Indeed, we expressly noted that we were not deciding \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [the officer\xe2\x80\x99s] conduct in [that] case was in fact objectively reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 345, n.\xc2\xa08.  The fact that the officers secured these approvals is certainly pertinent in assessing whether they could have held a reasonable belief that the warrant was supported by probable cause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defective that no reasonable officer could have believed it was valid, the court below relied heavily on our decision in Groh v. Ramirez, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551 (2004)\n, but that precedent is far afield.  There, we held that officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant in question failed to describe the items to be seized at all.  Id., at 557.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the portion of the form that called for a description of the \xe2\x80\x98person or property\xe2\x80\x99 to be seized, [the applicant] typed a description of [the target\xe2\x80\x99s] two-story blue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 554.  Thus, the warrant stated nonsensically that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there is now concealed [on the specified premises] a certain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling residence two story in height which is blue in color and has two additions attached to the east.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 554\xe2\x80\x93555, n.\xc2\xa02 (bracketed material in original).  Because \xe2\x80\x9ceven a cursory reading of the warrant in [that] case\xe2\x80\x94perhaps just a simple glance\xe2\x80\x94would have revealed a glaring de-ficiency that any reasonable police officer would have known was constitutionally fatal,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 564, we held that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe instant case is not remotely similar.  In contrast to Groh, any defect here would not have been obvious from the face of the warrant.  Rather, any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in the warrant.  This is not an error that \xe2\x80\x9cjust a simple glance\xe2\x80\x9d would have revealed.  Ibid.  Indeed, unlike in Groh, the officers here did not merely submit their application to a magistrate.  They also presented it for review by a superior officer, and a deputy district attorney, before submitting it to the magistrate.  The fact that none of the officials who reviewed the application expressed concern about its validity demonstrates that any error was not obvious.  Groh plainly does not control the result here.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question in this case is not whether the magistrate erred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to support the scope of the warrant he issued.  It is instead whether the magistrate so obviously erred that any reasonable officer would have recognized the error.  The occasions on which this standard will be met may be rare, but so too are the circumstances in which it will be appropriate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the face of judicial approval of his actions.  Even if the warrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously lacking in probable cause that the officers can be con- sidered \xe2\x80\x9cplainly incompetent\xe2\x80\x9d for concluding otherwise.  Malley, supra, at 341.

See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The warrant application recounted that a known gang member had used a sawed-off shotgun\xe2\x80\x94an illegal weapon under California law, see Cal.

Perhaps gang ties plus possession of an unlawful gun plus use of that gun to commit a violent assault do not add up to what was needed for this search: probable cause to believe that Bowen had additional illegal firearms (or legal firearms that he intended to use to violate the law) at the place he was staying.  But because our and the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decisions leave that conclusion debatable, a reasonable police officer could have found the warrant adequately supported by \xe2\x80\x9cindicia of probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Malley v. Briggs, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, \n345 (1986)\n.  So Messerschmidt and his fellow officers should receive qualified immunity for their search for firearms.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court, however, goes astray when it holds that a reasonable officer could have thought the warrant valid in approving a search for evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cstreet gang membership,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 52.  Membership in even the worst gang does not violate California law, so the officers could not search for gang paraphernalia just to establish Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s ties to the Crips.  Instead, the police needed probable cause to believe that such items would provide evidence of an actual crime\xe2\x80\x94and as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314, the only crime mentioned in the warrant application was the assault on Kelly.  The problem for the Court is that nothing in the application supports a link between Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s gang membership and that shooting.  Contra the Court\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate theory-spinning, see ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9316, Messerschmidt\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit in fact characterized the violent assault only as a domestic dispute, not as a gang-related one, see App. 55 (describing the crime as a \xe2\x80\x9cspousal assault and an assault with a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that description is consistent with the most natural understanding of the events.  The warrant application thus had a hole at its very center: It lacked any explanation of how gang items would (or even might) provide evidence of the domestic assault the police were investigating.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo fill this vacuum, the Court proposes an alternative, but similarly inadequate justification\xe2\x80\x94that gang paraphernalia could have demonstrated Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s connection to the Millender residence and to any evidence of the assault found there.  The dissent rightly notes one difficulty with this argument: The discovery of gang items would not have established that Bowen was staying at the house, given that several other gang members regularly did so.  See post, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  And even setting that issue aside, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning proves far too much: It would sanction equally well a search for any of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s possessions on the premises\xe2\x80\x94a result impos- sible to square with the \n \nFourth Amendment.  See, e.g., Andresen v. Maryland, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 463, \n480 (1976)\n (disapproving \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a general, exploratory rummaging in a person\xe2\x80\x99s belongings\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Coolidge v. New Hampshire, \n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 443, \n467 (1971)\n)).  In authorizing a search for all gang-related items, the warrant far outstripped the officers\xe2\x80\x99 probable cause.  Because a reasonable officer would have recognized that defect, I would not award qualified immunity to Messerschmidt and his colleagues for this aspect of their search.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill more fundamentally, the Court errs in scolding the Court of Appeals for failing to give \xe2\x80\x9cweight to the fact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved by the officers\xe2\x80\x99 superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral magistrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 17.  As the dissent points out, see post, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in Malley is to the opposite effect: An officer is not \xe2\x80\x9centitled to rely on the judgment of a judicial officer in finding that probable cause exists and hence issuing the warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 345.  Malley made clear that qualified immunity turned on the officer\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d considered separately from the mistake of the magistrate.  Id., at 346; see ibid., n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe officer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot excuse his own default by pointing to the greater incompetence of the magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (objecting to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to \xe2\x80\x9cgive little evidentiary weight to the finding of probable cause by a magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d).  And what we said in Malley about a magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s authorization applies still more strongly to the approval of other police officers or state attorneys.  All those individuals, as the Court puts it, are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the prosecution team.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  To make their views relevant is to enable those teammates (whether acting in good or bad faith) to confer immunity on each other for unreasonable conduct\xe2\x80\x94like applying for a warrant without anything resembling probable cause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I would reverse in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would remand this case for further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963718">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x93704\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tCURT MESSERSCHMIDT, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

First, the majority suggests that such evidence hypothetically \xe2\x80\x9cmight prove helpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting various de- fenses he could raise at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  That is a non-starter.  The \n \nFourth Amendment does not permit the police to search for evidence solely because it could be admissible for impeachment or rebuttal purposes.  If it did, the police would be equally entitled to obtain warrants to rifle through the papers of anyone reasonably suspected of a crime for all evidence of his bad character, Fed. Rule Evid. 404(a)(2)(B)(i), or any evidence of any \xe2\x80\x9ccrime, wrong, or other act\xe2\x80\x9d that might prove the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b)(2).  Indeed, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rationale presumably would authorize the police to search the residence of every member of Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s street gang for similar weapons\xe2\x80\x94which likewise \xe2\x80\x9cmight [have] prove[d] helpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting various defenses he could raise at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  It has long been the case, however, that such general searches, detached from probable cause, are impermissible.  See, e.g., Go-Bart Importing Co., 282 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 357.  By their own admission, however, the officers were not searching for gang-related indicia to bolster some hypothetical impeachment theory, but for other reasons: because \xe2\x80\x9cphotos sought re gang membership could be linked with other gang members, evidencing criminal activity as gang affiliation is an enhancement to criminal charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 181; see also id., at 145.

Giving weight to that fact would turn the \n \nFourth Amendment on its head.  This Court made clear in Malley that a police officer acting unreasonably cannot obtain qualified immunity on the basis of a neutral magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s approval.

The police cannot rationalize a search post hoc on the basis of information they failed to set forth in their warrant application to a neutral magistrate.
