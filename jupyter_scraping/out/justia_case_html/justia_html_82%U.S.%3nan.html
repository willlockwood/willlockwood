On this road quantities of grain are carried from the West to Chicago and other eastern towns.  Arriving at Dubuque, the grain, bound eastward, or as it was called "through grain," was formerly taken from the railcars, put on a ferry boat, carried thus across the Mississippi to Dunlieth (a town in Illinois directly opposite Dubuque), and there put upon cars of the Illinois Central Railroad and sent forward, east.  Dubuque was thus a point for transshipment.  In this state of things, the Sioux City &amp; Dubuque Railroad made a contract with Richmond and another, owners of an elevator at Dubuque beside the road and near the river, that they, the owners of this elevator, should have the handling of all the "through grain" and that the railroad company would pay them a certain price per bushel for receiving and discharging it and would pay also for storage of it when exceeding ten days.</p>\n<p>With this contract in force, Congress in 1866 passed two acts, one of June 15th, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] entitled "An act to facilitate commercial, postal, and military communications among the several states," which enacted:</p>\n<p>"That every railroad company in the United States &amp;c., be, and is hereby, authorized to carry upon and over its road, boats, bridges, and ferries, all passengers, troops, government supplies, freight, and property on their way from any state to another state, and to receive compensation therefor, <em>and to connect with roads of other states so as to form continuous lines for the transportation of the same to the place of destination.</em>"</p>\n<p>The other, an Act of July 25 [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] -- entitled "An act to authorize the construction of certain bridges, and establish them as post roads."  This act provided for the construction of certain bridges across the Mississippi River, including one at Dubuque, and declared that they shall be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 82 U.

The grain passed continuously on.  Thereupon, Richmond, and the other owners of the elevator, brought suit against the companies, alleging that they, the companies, were</p>\n<p>"Daily receiving through grain as aforesaid, and passing the same through Dubuque without permitting the plaintiffs to have the handling of the same at their elevator as aforesaid and without paying the plaintiffs therefor."</p>\n<p>The petition asked for damages and prayed for an injunction to restrain the companies from delivering grain otherwise than through their elevator.</p>\n<p>The defendants denied every allegation in the petition, and averred that the plaintiffs had been paid in full for all of the grain which they were entitled to handle under and by virtue of the said contract.  They did not, however, plead specially the Constitution of the United States, nor the acts of Congress hereinbefore named, as a defense to the demand.</p>\n<p>The case was heard in the Supreme Court of Iowa, where a final decree was rendered giving the plaintiffs in the case $73,186 damages and concluding thus:</p>\n<p>"And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the claim of the said defendants that the Constitution of the United States and certain acts of the Congress of the United States, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 82 U.
