The key claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a simple mathematical formula.  The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand.  The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical problem.  The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and affirmed.  The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed.  The en banc court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under Patent Act, 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> whether the invention produced a \xe2\x80\x9cuseful, concrete, and tangible result,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc.</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa03d 1368, 1373\xe2\x80\x94holding instead that a claimed process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.  Concluding that this \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation test\xe2\x80\x9d is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not patent eligible.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left">545 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932 and II\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x932, concluding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claimed invention is not patent eligible.

S. 303</a>, 308, in order to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 308\xe2\x80\x93309.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents provide three specific exceptions to \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s broad principles: \xe2\x80\x9claws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 309.  While not required by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the notion that a patentable process must be \xe2\x80\x9cnew and useful.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, in any case, the exceptions have defined the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach as a matter of statutory <em>stare decisis</em> going back 150 years.  See <em>Le Roy</em> v. <em>Tatham</em>, 14 How. 156, 174.  The \xc2\xa7101 eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test.  Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the four categories, it must also satisfy \xe2\x80\x9cthe conditions and requirements of this title,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(a), including novelty, see \xc2\xa7102, nonobviousness, see \xc2\xa7103, and a full and particular description, see \xc2\xa7112.  The invention at issue is claimed to be a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xc2\xa7100(b) defines as a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for patent eligibility under \xc2\xa7101.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish that although that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  In holding to the contrary, the Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation: Courts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Diehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/175/index.html">450 U. S. 175</a>, 182, and, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless otherwise defined, \xe2\x80\x98words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d that would require it to be tied to a machine or the transformation of an article.  Respondent Patent Director urges the Court to read \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s other three patentable categories as confining \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d to a machine or transformation.  However, the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>is inapplicable here, for \xc2\xa7100(b) already explicitly defines \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Burgess</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/124/index.html">553 U. S. 124</a>, 130, and nothing about the section\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of those other categories suggests that a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d must be tied to one of them.  Finally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.  Recent authorities show that the test was never intended to be exhaustive or exclusive.  See, <em>e.g., Parker</em> v. <em>Flook</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/584/index.html">437 U. S. 584</a>, 588, n.\xc2\xa09.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d that would categorically exclude business methods.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa7100(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d definition, at least as a textual matter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business.  The Court is unaware of any argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 182, of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d excludes business methods.  Nor is it clear what a business method exception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently.  The categorical exclusion argument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents: Under \xc2\xa7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on \xe2\x80\x9ca method in [a] patent,\xe2\x80\x9d the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use.  By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents.  Section 273 thus clarifies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under \xc2\xa7101.  A contrary conclusion would violate the canon against interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous.  See <em>Corley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  Finally, while \xc2\xa7273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9311.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Even though petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application is not categorically outside of \xc2\xa7101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets.  Under <em>Benson</em>, <em>Flook</em>, and <em>Diehr</em>, however, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent abstract ideas.  Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and reduce that concept to a mathematical formula.  This is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in <em>Benson</em> and <em>Flook</em>.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent the use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation.  They add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention held patent ineligible in <em>Flook.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 patent application can be rejected under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in \xc2\xa7100(b) and looking to the guideposts in <em>Benson</em>, <em>Flook</em>, and <em>Diehr</em>.  Nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s past interpretations of \xc2\xa7101.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State Street</em>, 49 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1373.  The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents.  In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s development of other limiting criteria that further the Patent Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.

The patent application claims a procedure for instructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the risk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the economy.  Three arguments are advanced for the proposition that the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent law: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform an article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business; and (3) it is merely an abstract idea.  The Court of Appeals ruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called machine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used for determining the patentability of a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under the Patent Act, 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application seeks patent protection for a claimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of commodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes.  The key claims are claims 1 and 4.  Claim 1 describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk.  Claim 4 puts the concept articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.  Claim 1 consists of the following steps:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumers;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b)\xe2\x80\x82identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(c)\xe2\x80\x82initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand for energy.  For example, claim 2 claims \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he method of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and said market participants are transmission distributors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 20.  Some of these claims also suggest familiar statistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in claim 4\xe2\x80\x99s equation.  For example, claim 7 advises using well-known random analysis techniques to determine how much a seller will gain \xe2\x80\x9cfrom each transaction under each historical weather pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The patent examiner rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application, explaining that it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application, therefore, the invention is not directed to the technological arts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.  The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed, concluding that the application involved only mental steps that do not transform physical matter and was directed to an abstract idea.  <em>Id.,</em> at 181a\xe2\x80\x93186a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the case en banc and affirmed.  The case produced five different opinions.  Students of patent law would be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court.  The court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x94whether it produces a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98useful, concrete, and tangible result\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as articulated in <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc.</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa03d 1368, 1373 (1998), and <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em> v. <em>Excel Communications, Inc., </em>172 F.\xc2\xa03d 1352, 1357 (1999).  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bilski, </em>545 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, 959\xe2\x80\x93960, and n.\xc2\xa019 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).  The court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] claimed process is surely patent-eligible under \xc2\xa7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 954.  The court concluded this \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation test\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole test governing \xc2\xa7101 analyses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 955, and thus the \xe2\x80\x9ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under \xc2\xa7101,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 956.  Applying the machine-or-transformation test, the court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application was not patent eligible.  <em>Id.</em>, at 963\xe2\x80\x93966.  Judge Dyk wrote a separate concurring opinion, providing historical support for the court\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  <em>Id.,</em> at 966\xe2\x80\x93976.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three judges wrote dissenting opinions.  Judge Mayer argued that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application was \xe2\x80\x9cnot eligible for patent protection because it is directed to a method of conducting business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 998.  He urged the adoption of a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological standard for patentability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1010.  Judge Rader would have found petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims were an unpatentable abstract idea.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1011.  Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application was outside of the reach of \xc2\xa7101.  She did not say that the application should have been granted but only that the issue should be remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the application qualified as patentable under other provisions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 997.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court granted certiorari.  556 U.

This Court has not indicated that the existence of these well-established exceptions gives the Judiciary <em>carte blanche</em> to impose other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and design.  Concerns about attempts to call any form of human activity a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d can be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements of \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test for what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d (as opposed to just an important and useful clue) violates these statutory interpretation principles.  Section 100(b) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98process\xe2\x80\x99 means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court is unaware of any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 182, of the definitional terms \xe2\x80\x9cprocess, art or method\xe2\x80\x9d that would require these terms to be tied to a machine or to transform an article.  Respondent urges the Court to look to the other patentable categories in \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x94machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter\xe2\x80\x94to confine the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d to a machine or transformation, under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis</em>.

This canon is inapplicable here, for \xc2\xa7100(b) already explicitly defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Burgess</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/124/index.html">553 U.

It is true that <em>Cochrane</em> v. <em>Deener,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/94/780/index.html">94 U. S. 780</a>, 788 (1877), explained that a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9can act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  More recent cases, however, have rejected the broad implications of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority shows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive test.  <em>Gottschalk</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/index.html">409 U. S. 63</a>, 70 (1972), noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ransformation and reduction of an article \xe2\x80\x98to a different state or thing\xe2\x80\x99 is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the same time, it explicitly declined to \xe2\x80\x9chold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet [machine or transformation] requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 71.  <em>Flook</em> took a similar approach, \xe2\x80\x9cassum[ing] that a valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet [the machine-or-transformation test].\xe2\x80\x9d  437 U. S., at 588, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish that the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under \xc2\xa7101.  The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in earlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained by Judge Dyk\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful historical review.  See 545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 966\xe2\x80\x93976 (concurring opinion).  But times change.  Technology and other innovations progress in unexpected ways.  For example, it was once forcefully argued that until recent times, \xe2\x80\x9cwell-established principles of patent law probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid patent on almost any conceivable computer program.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diehr</em>, 450 U. S., at 195 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But this fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such as computer programs are always unpatentable.  See <em>id.,</em> at 192\xe2\x80\x93193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for molding rubber that included a computer program is within patentable subject matter).  Section 101 is a \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0Ag Supply, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/124/index.html">534 U. S. 124</a>, 135 (2001).  A categorical rule denying patent protection for \xe2\x80\x9cinventions in areas not contemplated by Congress . . . would frustrate the purposes of the patent law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chakrabarty</em>, 447 U. S., at 315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a sufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in the Industrial Age\xe2\x80\x94for example, inventions grounded in a physical or other tangible form.  But there are reasons to doubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for determining the patentability of inventions in the Information Age.  As numerous <em>amicus</em> briefs argue, the machine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as to the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medicine techniques, and inventions based on linear programming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital signals.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Business Software Alliance 24\xe2\x80\x9325; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et\xc2\xa0al. 14\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8\xe2\x80\x9315; Brief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association 17\xe2\x80\x9322; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation test to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions of such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring the larger object of securing patents for valuable inventions without transgressing the public domain.  The dissent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.  545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1015.  As a result, in deciding whether previously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess[es],\xe2\x80\x9d it may not make sense to require courts to confine themselves to asking the questions posed by the machine-or-transformation test.  Section 101\xe2\x80\x99s terms suggest that new technologies may call for new inquiries.  See <em>Benson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 71 (to \xe2\x80\x9cfreeze process patents to old technologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing technology[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 is not our purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not commenting on the patentability of any particular invention, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned technologies from the Information Age should or should not receive patent protection.  This Age puts the possibility of innovation in the hands of more people and raises new difficulties for the patent law.  With ever more people trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in striking the balance between protecting inventors and not granting monopolies over procedures that others would discover by independent, creative application of general principles.  Nothing in this opinion should be read to take a position on where that balance ought to be struck.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d categorically excludes business methods.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cmethod,\xe2\x80\x9d which is within \xc2\xa7100(b)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d at least as a textual matter and before consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n orderly procedure or process \xe2\x80\xa6 regular way or manner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure adopted in investigation or instruction\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court is unaware of any argument that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 182, of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d excludes business methods.  Nor is it clear how far a prohibition on business method patents would reach, and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Hall, Business and Financial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56 Scottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009)  (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no precise definition of . . .  business method patents\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument that business methods are categorically outside of \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s scope is further undermined by the fact that federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents.  Under 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on \xe2\x80\x9ca method in [a] patent,\xe2\x80\x9d the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use.  For purposes of this defense alone, \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9ca method of doing or conducting business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7273(a)(3).  In other words, by allowing this defense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents.  Section 273\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod,\xe2\x80\x9d to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a prior-enacted statute.  But what \xc2\xa7273 does is clarify the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A conclusion that business methods are not patentable in any circumstances would render \xc2\xa7273 meaningless.    This would violate the canon against interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous.  See <em>Corley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9).  This principle, of course, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the U. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at different times.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hague</em> v. <em>Committee for Industrial Organization</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/index.html">307 U. S. 496</a>, 529\xe2\x80\x93530 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.).  This established rule of statutory interpretation cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of various legislators in enacting the subsequent provision.  Finally, while \xc2\xa7273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreting \xc2\xa7101 to exclude all business methods simply because business method patents were rarely issued until modern times revives many of the previously discussed difficulties.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  At the same time, some business method patents raise special problems in terms of vagueness and suspect validity.  See <em>eBay Inc. </em>v.<em> MercExchange, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/388/index.html">547 U. S. 388</a>, 397 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The Information Age empowers people with new capacities to perform statistical analyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and sophistication that enable the design of protocols for more efficient performance of a vast number of business tasks.  If a high enough bar is not set when considering patent applications of this sort, patent examiners and courts could be flooded with claims that would put a chill on creative endeavor and dynamic change.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In searching for a limiting principle, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide useful tools.  See <em>infra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  Indeed, if the Court of Appeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category or class of patent applications that claim to instruct how business should be conducted, and then rule that the category is unpatentable because, for instance, it represents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion might well be in accord with controlling precedent.  See <em>ibid.</em>  But beyond this or some other limitation consistent with the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the possibility that there are at least some processes that can be fairly described as business methods that are within patentable subject matter under \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, even if a particular business method fits into the statutory definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d that does not mean that the application claiming that method should be granted.  In order to receive patent protection, any claimed invention must be novel, \xc2\xa7102, nonobvious, \xc2\xa7103, and fully and particularly described, \xc2\xa7112.  These limitations serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever present in patent law, between stimulating innovation by protecting inventors and impeding progress by granting patents when not justified by the statutory design.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application is not categorically outside of \xc2\xa7101 under the two broad and atextual approaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets.  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  Rather than adopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case narrowly on the basis of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Benson</em>, <em>Flook</em>, and <em>Diehr</em>, which show that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are not patentable processes because they are attempts to patent abstract ideas.  Indeed, all members of the Court agree that the patent application at issue here falls outside of \xc2\xa7101 because it claims an abstract idea.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Benson</em>, the Court considered whether a patent application for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary code was a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  409 U. S., at 64\xe2\x80\x9367.  The Court first explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 67 (quoting <em>Le Roy</em>, 14 How., at 175).  The Court then held the application at issue was not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d but an unpatentable abstract idea.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is conceded that one may not patent an idea.  But in practical effect that would be the result if the formula for converting\xe2\x80\x82.\xe2\x80\x82.\xc2\xa0. numerals to pure binary numerals were patented in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  409 U. S., at 71.  A contrary holding \xe2\x80\x9cwould wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 72.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Flook</em>, the Court considered the next logical step after <em>Benson</em>.  The applicant there attempted to patent a procedure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic conversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining industries.  The application\xe2\x80\x99s only innovation was reliance on a mathematical algorithm.  437 U. S., at 585\xe2\x80\x93586.  <em>Flook</em> held the invention was not a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the algorithm in <em>Benson</em>, had been limited so that it could still be freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining industries.  437 U. S., at 589\xe2\x80\x93590<em>.</em>  Nevertheless, <em>Flook</em> rejected \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 590.  The Court concluded that the process at issue there was \xe2\x80\x9cunpatentable under \xc2\xa7101, not because it contain[ed] a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no patentable invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 594.  As the Court later explained, <em>Flook</em> stands for the proposition that the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment\xe2\x80\x9d or adding \xe2\x80\x9cinsignificant postsolution activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diehr</em>, 450 U. S., at 191\xe2\x80\x93192.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in <em>Diehr</em>, the Court established a limitation on the principles articulated in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Flook</em>.  The application in <em>Diehr</em> claimed a previously unknown method for \xe2\x80\x9cmolding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products,\xe2\x80\x9d using a mathematical formula to complete some of its several steps by way of a computer.  450 U. S., at 177.  <em>Diehr</em> explained that while an abstract idea, law of nature, or mathematical formula could not be patented, \xe2\x80\x9can <em>application</em> of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 187.  <em>Diehr</em> emphasized the need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and then \xe2\x80\xa6 ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 188.  Finally, the Court concluded that because the claim was not \xe2\x80\x9can attempt to patent a mathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial process for the molding of rubber products,\xe2\x80\x9d it fell within \xc2\xa7101\xe2\x80\x99s patentable subject matter.  <em>Id.,</em> at 192\xe2\x80\x93193.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application is not a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  Claims 1 and 4 in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application explain the basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk: \xe2\x80\x9cHedging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, <em>e.g., </em>D.

Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses 581\xe2\x80\x93582 (13th ed. 2010); S. Ross, R. Westerfield, &amp; B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Corporate Finance 743\xe2\x80\x93744 (8th ed. 2008).  The concept of hedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathematical formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in <em>Benson</em> and <em>Flook</em>.  Allowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 remaining claims are broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.  <em>Flook</em> established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable.  That is exactly what the remaining claims in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application do.  These claims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of hedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation.  Indeed, these claims add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention in <em>Flook</em> did, for the <em>Flook</em> invention was at least directed to the narrower domain of signaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, the Court once again declines to impose limitations on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The patent application here can be rejected under our precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.  The Court, therefore, need not define further what constitutes a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in \xc2\xa7100(b) and looking to the guideposts in <em>Benson</em>, <em>Flook</em>, and <em>Diehr</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should be read as endorsing interpretations of \xc2\xa7101 that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has used in the past.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State Street</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1373; <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 172 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1357.  It may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents, including (but not limited to) application of our opinions in <em>Benson, Flook</em>, and <em>Diehr</em>.  In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means foreclose the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s development of other limiting criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act and are not inconsistent with its text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia does not join Parts II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x932 and II\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x932.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963381">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nBILSKI V.

The only question presented in this case is whether the so-called machine-or-transformation test is the exclusive test for what constitutes a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101.  It would be possible to answer that question simply by holding, as the entire Court agrees, that although the machine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is not the <em>exclusive</em> test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty that currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide further guidance.  But I would take a different approach.  Rather than making any broad statements about how to define the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101 or tinkering with the bounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I would restore patent law to its historical and constitutional moorings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For centuries, it was considered well established that a series of steps for conducting business was not, in itself, patentable.  In the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the Federal Circuit and others called this proposition into question.  Congress quickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a stopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant new problem for the business community.  It passed the First Inventors Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat. 1501A\xe2\x80\x93555 (codified at 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7273), which provides a limited defense to claims of patent infringement, see \xc2\xa7273(b), for \xe2\x80\x9cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7273(a)(3).  Following several more years of confusion, the Federal Circuit changed course, overruling recent decisions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a patentable process only if it is tied to a machine or transforms an article into a different state or thing.  This \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation test\xe2\x80\x9d excluded general methods of doing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other subjects that could be called processes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court correctly holds that the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes a patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But the Court is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any series of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of nature may constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7101.  The language in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to this effect can only cause mischief.  The wiser course would have been to hold that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 method is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d because it describes only a general method of engaging in business transactions\xe2\x80\x94and business methods are not patentable.   More precisely, although a process is not patent-ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting business, a claim that merely describes a method of doing business does not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court provides a brief statement of facts, <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934, a more complete explication may be useful for those unfamiliar with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 patent application and this case\xe2\x80\x99s procedural history.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 patent application describes a series of steps for managing risk amongst buyers and sellers of commodities.  The general method, described in Claim 1, entails \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider at a fixed price,\xe2\x80\x9d and consists of the following steps:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at\na fixed rate based upon historical averages, said\nfixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said\nconsumers;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b)\xe2\x80\x82identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(c)\xe2\x80\x82initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the patent application makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cmethod can be used for any commodity to manage consumption risk in a fixed bill price product,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 11, it includes specific applications of the method, particularly in the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in demand during specified time periods.  See <em>id.</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  Energy suppliers and consumers may use that method to hedge their risks by agreeing upon a fixed series of payments at regular intervals throughout the year instead of charging or paying prices that fluctuate in response to changing weather conditions.  The patent application describes a series of steps, including the evaluation of historical costs and weather variables and the use of economic and statistical formulas, to analyze these data and to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes.  See <em>id.</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The patent examiner rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9cis not directed to the technological arts,\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it \xe2\x80\x9cis not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) affirmed the examiner\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but it rejected the position that a patentable process must relate to \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological arts\xe2\x80\x9d or be performed on a machine.  <em>Id.</em>, at 180a\xe2\x80\x93181a.  Instead, the Board denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 patent on two alternative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent involves only mental steps that do not transform physical subject matter, <em>id.</em>, at 181a\xe2\x80\x93184a; and, second, that it is directed to an \xe2\x80\x9cabstract idea,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 184a\xe2\x80\x93187a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  After briefing and argument before a three-judge panel, the court <em>sua sponte</em> decided to hear the case en banc<em> </em>and ordered the parties to address: (1) whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cclaim 1 \xe2\x80\xa6 claims patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.

Eleven of the twelve judges agreed that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims do not describe a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101.  Chief Judge Michel\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, joined by eight other judges, rejected several possible tests for what is a patent-eligible process, including whether the patent produces a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98useful, concrete and tangible result,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d whether the process relates to \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological arts,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical exclusions\xe2\x80\x9d for certain processes such as business methods.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bilski, </em>545 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, 959\xe2\x80\x93960 (2008).  Relying on several of our cases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim on a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle\xe2\x80\x9d from a claim on a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaimed process is surely patent-eligible under \xc2\xa7101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 954\xe2\x80\x93955.  The court further concluded that this \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation test\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>sole</em> test governing \xc2\xa7101 analyses,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the \xe2\x80\x9ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under \xc2\xa7101,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 956.  Applying that test, the court held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not a patent-eligible process.  <em>Id.</em>, at 963\xe2\x80\x93966.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a separate opinion reaching the same conclusion, Judge Dyk carefully reviewed the history of American patent law and English precedents upon which our law is based, and found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe unpatentability of processes not involving manufactures, machines, or compositions of matter has been firmly embedded \xe2\x80\xa6 since the time of the Patent Act of 1793.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 966.  Judge Dyk observed, moreover, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no suggestion in any of this early consideration of process patents that processes for organizing human activity were or ever had been patentable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 972.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three judges wrote dissenting opinions, although two of those judges agreed that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not patent eligible.  Judge Mayer would have held that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim \xe2\x80\x9cis not eligible for patent protection because it is directed to a method of conducting business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 998.  He submitted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he patent system is intended to protect and promote advances in science and technology, not ideas about how to structure commercial transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cAffording patent protection to business methods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves to hinder rather than promote innovation[,] and usurps that which rightfully belongs in the public domain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Rader would have rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim on the ground that it seeks to patent merely an abstract idea.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1011.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim seeks a patent on ineligible subject matter.  Judge Newman urged that the en banc court\xe2\x80\x99s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text and history of \xc2\xa7101, <em>id.</em>, at 977\xe2\x80\x93978, 985\xe2\x80\x93990, is in tension with several of decisions by this Court, <em>id.</em>, at 978\xe2\x80\x93985, and the Federal Circuit, <em>id.</em>, at 990\xe2\x80\x93992, and will invalidate thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on those decisions, <em>id.</em>, at 992\xe2\x80\x93994.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this case, I will comment briefly on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The opinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and, if misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled areas of the law.  Three preliminary observations may be clarifying.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent Act must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not as they have traditionally been understood in the context of patent law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6 (terms in \xc2\xa7101 must be viewed in light of their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 10 (patentable \xe2\x80\x9cmethod\xe2\x80\x9d is any \xe2\x80\x9corderly procedure or process,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregular way or manner of doing anything,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cset form of procedure adopted in investigation or instruction\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As I will explain at more length in Part III, <em>infra</em>, if this portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion were taken literally, the results would be absurd: Anything that constitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it is novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity.  But the opinion cannot be taken literally on this point.  The Court makes this clear when it accepts that the \xe2\x80\x9catextual\xe2\x80\x9d machine-or-transformation test, <em>ante</em>, at 12, is \xe2\x80\x9cuseful and important,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, even though it \xe2\x80\x9cviolates\xe2\x80\x9d the stated \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory interpretation principles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6; and when the Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt commonly used ideas, see <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue\npresented to us, the opinion uses some language that seems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the machine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentability.  Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests\nthat these criteria may operate differently when addressing technologies of a recent vintage.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (machine-or-transformation test is useful \xe2\x80\x9cfor evaluating processes similar to those in the Industrial Age,\xe2\x80\x9d but is less useful \xe2\x80\x9cfor determining the patentability of inventions in the Information Age\xe2\x80\x9d).  In moments of caution, however, the opinion for the Court explains\xe2\x80\x94correctly\xe2\x80\x94that the Court is merely restoring the law to its historical state of rest.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents establish that the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under \xc2\xa7101\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notwithstanding this internal tension, I understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to hold only that the machine-or-transformation test remains an important test for patentability.  Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be evaluated using these criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the questions presented\xe2\x80\x94whether the particular series of steps in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application is an abstract idea\xe2\x80\x94the Court uses language that could suggest a shift in our approach to that issue.  Although I happen to agree that petitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does not show how this conclusion follows \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ly],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, from our case law.  The patent now before us is not for \xe2\x80\x9c[a] principle, in the abstract,\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Flook</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/584/index.html"></a><a href="/us/437/584/index.html">437 U. S. 584</a>, 589 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor does it claim the sort of phenomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by the mathematical formula at issue in <em>Gottschalk</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/index.html">409 U. S. 63</a>, 67 (1972), and in <em>Flook.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court construes petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims on processes for pricing as claims on \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, and thus discounts the application\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of what sorts of data to use, and how to analyze those data, as mere \xe2\x80\x9ctoken postsolution components,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15.  In other words, the Court artificially limits petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims to hedging, and then concludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a term that describes a category of processes including petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Why the Court does this is never made clear.  One might think that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis means that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is <em>itself</em> an unpatentable, abstract idea.  But we have never suggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of patentable processes.  It is true, as the Court observes, that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application is phrased broadly.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  But claim specification is covered by \xc2\xa7112, not \xc2\xa7101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable idea merely because it was described without sufficient specificity, the Court could be calling into question some of our own prior decisions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  At points, the opinion suggests that novelty is the clue.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  But the fact that hedging is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98long prevalent in our system of commerce,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, cannot justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe proper construction of \xc2\xa7101 \xe2\x80\xa6 does not involve the familiar issu[e] of novelty\xe2\x80\x9d that arises under \xc2\xa7102.  <em>Flook</em>, 437 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 12 (courts should use the abstract-idea rule as a \xe2\x80\x9ctoo[l]\xe2\x80\x9d to set \xe2\x80\x9ca high enough bar\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhen considering patent applications of this sort\xe2\x80\x9d).

Indeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the machine-or-transformation criteria.  The Court essentially asserts its conclusion that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 application claims an abstract idea.  This mode of analysis (or lack thereof) may have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it also means that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s musings on this issue stand for very little.  </p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that the text of \xc2\xa7101 must be the starting point of our analysis.

S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08, Congress has passed a series of patent laws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain inventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging innovation.  In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952 (1952 Act), Congress has provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title,\xe2\x80\x9d 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101, which include that the patent also be novel, \xc2\xa7102, and nonobvious, \xc2\xa7103.  The statute thus authorizes four categories of subject matter that may be patented: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter.  Section 101 imposes a threshold condition.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o patent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel, and nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kewanee Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Bicron Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/470/index.html">416 U.

S. 141</a>, 151 (1989).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text of the Patent Act does not on its face give much guidance about what constitutes a patentable process.  The statute defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess, art or method [that] includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7100(b).  But, this definition is not especially helpful, given that it also uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d and is therefore somewhat circular.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As lay speakers use the word \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d it constitutes any series of steps.  But it has always been clear that, as used in \xc2\xa7101, the term does not refer to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98process\xe2\x80\x99 in the ordinary sense of the word,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 588; see also <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Burden</em>, 15 How. 252, 268 (1854) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term process is often used in a more vague sense, in which it cannot be the subject of a patent\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, as discussed in some detail in Part IV, <em>infra</em>, the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d (along with the definitions given to that term) has long accumulated a distinctive meaning in patent law.  When the term was used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended nor understood to encompass <em>any</em> series of steps or any <em>way </em>to do any <em>thing</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that understanding in mind, the Government has argued that because \xe2\x80\x9ca word\xe2\x80\x9d in a statute \xe2\x80\x9cis given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it\xe2\x80\x9d associates, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U. S. 285</a>, 294 (2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he other three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject matter identified in Section 101\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94all \xe2\x80\x98are things made by man, and involve technology.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 26.  Specifically, the Government submits, we may infer \xe2\x80\x9cthat the term \xe2\x80\x98process\xe2\x80\x99 is limited to technological and industrial methods.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court rejects this submission categorically, on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7100(b) already explicitly defines the term \xe2\x80\x98process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  But \xc2\xa7100(b) defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d by using the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as several other general terms.  This is not a case, then, in which we must <em>either </em>\xe2\x80\x9cfollow\xe2\x80\x9d a definition, <em>ante</em>, at 7, <em>or</em> rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of an ambiguous term.  The definition itself contains the very ambiguous term that we must define.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the answer lies in between the Government\xe2\x80\x99s and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s positions: The terms adjacent to \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101 provide a clue as to its meaning, although not a very strong clue.  Section 101\xe2\x80\x99s list of categories of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunctive, suggesting that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d has content distinct from the other items in the list.  It would therefore be illogical to \xe2\x80\x9crob\xe2\x80\x9d the word \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d of all independent meaning.  <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Sonotone Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/index.html">442 U. S. 330</a>, 338 (1979).  Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences about what is a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d from common attributes in \xc2\xa7101, it is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a perceived overarching theme.  Given the many moving parts at work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely confirming our preconceived notions of what should be patentable or of seeing common attributes that track \xe2\x80\x9cthe familiar issues of novelty and obviousness\xe2\x80\x9d that arise under other sections of the statute but are not relevant to \xc2\xa7101, <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 588.  The placement of \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d next to other items thus cannot prove that the term is limited to any particular categories; it does, however, give reason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d extends to cover any series of steps at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes a more serious interpretive error.  As briefly discussed in Part II, <em>supra</em>, the Court at points appears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101 is not a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98process\xe2\x80\x99 in the ordinary sense of the word,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 588.  Instead, the Court posits that the word \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d must be understood in light of its \xe2\x80\x9cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although this is a fine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a deeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex terms of art developed against a particular historical background.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Indeed, the approach would render \xc2\xa7101 almost comical.  A process for training a dog, a series of dance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe even words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of typing letters or uttering sounds\xe2\x80\x94all would be patent-eligible.  I am confident that the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101 is not nearly so capacious.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So is the Court, perhaps.  What is particularly incredible about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s stated method of interpreting \xc2\xa7101 (other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory of \xc2\xa7101) is that the Court deviates from its own professed commitment to \xe2\x80\x9cordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  As noted earlier, the Court accepts a role for the \xe2\x80\x9catextual\xe2\x80\x9d machine-or-transformation \xe2\x80\x9cclue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, 7.  The Court also accepts that we have \xe2\x80\x9cforeclose[d] a purely literal reading of \xc2\xa7101,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims that are close to \xe2\x80\x9claws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Diehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/175/index.html"></a><a href="/us/450/175/index.html">450 U. S. 175</a>, 185 (1981), do not count as \xe2\x80\x9cprocesses\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101, even if they can be colloquially described as such.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court attempts to justify this latter exception to \xc2\xa7101 as \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of statutory <em>stare decisis</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  But it is strange to think that the very same term must be interpreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its historical usage on others.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa7101 is even more remarkable because its willingness to <em>exclude</em> general principles from the provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach is in tension with its apparent willingness to <em>include </em>steps for conducting business.  The history of patent law contains strong norms against patenting these two categories of subject matter.  Both norms were presumably incorporated by Congress into the Patent Act in 1952.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the text of \xc2\xa7101 does not on its face convey the scope of patentable processes, it is necessary, in my view, to review the history of our patent law in some detail.  This approach yields a much more straightforward answer to this case than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  As I read the history, it strongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing business is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am, of course, mindful of the fact that \xc2\xa7101 \xe2\x80\x9cis a dynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions,\xe2\x80\x9d and that one must therefore view historical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an appropriately high level of generality.  <em>J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0Ag Supply, </em>534 U. S., at 135; see also <em>Chakrabarty</em>, 447 U. S., at 315\xe2\x80\x93316.  But it is nonetheless significant that while people have long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing business fall outside of the subject matter that has \xe2\x80\x9chistorically been eligible to receive the protection of our patent laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diehr</em>, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond what the modern patent \xe2\x80\x9cstatute was enacted to protect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 593.  It is also significant that when Congress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against the background of a well-settled understanding that a series of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.  These considerations ought to guide our analysis.  As Justice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, \xe2\x80\x9ca page of history is worth a volume of logic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>New York Trust Co.</em> v. <em>Eisner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/256/345/index.html">256 U.

The statute generally prohibited the Crown from granting such exclusive rights, 21 Jam. 1, c.\xc2\xa03, \xc2\xa71 (1623), in 4 Statutes of the Realm 1213 (reprint 1963), but it contained exceptions that, <em>inter alia</em>, permitted grants of exclusive rights to the \xe2\x80\x9cworking or making of any manner of new Manufacture.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to that provision, patents issued for the \xe2\x80\x9cmode, method, or way of manufacturing,\xe2\x80\x9d F. Campin, Law of Patents for Inventions 11 (1869) (emphasis deleted), and English courts construed the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cworking or making of any manner of new manufactures\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass manufacturing processes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Boulton</em> v. <em>Bull</em>, 2 H.

Thus, English courts upheld James Watt\xe2\x80\x99s famous patent on a method for reducing the consumption of fuel in steam engines,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] as well as a variety of patents issued for methods of synthesizing substances or building mechanical devices.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although it is difficult to derive a precise understanding of what sorts of methods were patentable under English law, there is no basis in the text of the Statute of Monopolies, nor in pre-1790 English precedent, to infer that business methods could qualify.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  There was some debate throughout the relevant time period about what processes could be patented.

Such patents were exceedingly rare, and some of them probably were viewed not as inventions or discoveries but rather as special state privileges[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] that until the mid-1800\xe2\x80\x99s were recorded alongside inventions in the patent records, see MacLeod 1\xe2\x80\x932 (explaining that various types of patents were listed together).

There is room on the margins to debate exactly what qualifies as either.  There is room, moreover, to debate at what level of generality we should understand these broad and historical terms, given that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] rule that unanticipated inventions are without protection would conflict with the core concept of the patent law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chakrabarty</em>, 447 U.

It appears, however, that regardless of how one construes the term \xe2\x80\x9cuseful arts,\xe2\x80\x9d business methods are not included.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Noah Webster\xe2\x80\x99s first American dictionary[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cdisposition or modification of <em>things</em> by human skill, to answer the purpose intended,\xe2\x80\x9d and differentiated between \xe2\x80\x9cuseful or mechanic\xe2\x80\x9d arts, on the one hand, and \xe2\x80\x9cliberal or polite\xe2\x80\x9d arts, on the other.  1 An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (facsimile edition) (emphasis added).  Although other dictionaries defined the word \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d more broadly,[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] Webster\xe2\x80\x99s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactures\xe2\x80\x9d in the earlier English statute.  And we know that the term \xe2\x80\x9cuseful arts\xe2\x80\x9d was used in the founding era to refer to manufacturing and similar applied trades.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  See Coulter, The Field of the Statutory Useful Arts, 34 J.

Indeed, just days before the Constitutional Convention, one delegate listed examples of American progress in \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactures and the useful arts,\xe2\x80\x9d all of which involved the creation or transformation of physical substances.  See T. Coxe, An Address to an Assembly of the Friends of American Manufactures 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (1787) (listing, <em>inter alia</em>, meal, ships, liquors, potash, gunpowder, paper, starch, articles of iron, stone work, carriages, and harnesses).  Numerous scholars have suggested that the term \xe2\x80\x9cuseful arts\xe2\x80\x9d was widely understood to encompass the fields that we would now describe as relating to technology or \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological arts.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, fields such as business and finance were not generally considered part of the \xe2\x80\x9cuseful arts\xe2\x80\x9d in the founding Era.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, The Federalist No. 8, p. 69 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (distinguishing between \xe2\x80\x9cthe arts of industry, and the science of finance\xe2\x80\x9d); 30 The Writings of George Washington 1745\xe2\x80\x931799, p.\xe2\x80\x82186  (J.

Indeed, the same delegate to the Constitutional Convention who gave an address in which he listed triumphs in the useful arts distinguished between those arts and the conduct of business.  He explained that investors were now attracted to the \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactures and the useful arts,\xe2\x80\x9d much as they had long invested in \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce, navigation, stocks, banks, and insurance companies.\xe2\x80\x9d  T.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Graham</em>, 383 U. S., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (discussing Thomas Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s observations).  It has been suggested, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]erhaps this was in part a function of an understanding\xe2\x80\x94shared widely among legislators, courts, patent office officials, and inventors\xe2\x80\x94about what patents were meant to protect.  Everyone knew that manufactures and machines were at the core of the patent system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Merges, Property Rights for Business Concepts and Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech. L.\xc2\xa0J. 577, 585 (1999) (hereinafter Merges).  Thus, although certain processes, such as those related to the technology of the time, might have been considered patentable, it is possible that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]gainst this background, it would have been seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent\xe2\x80\x9d on methods of conducting business.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p>\n\nDevelopment of American Patent Law</p>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the first years of the patent system, no patents were issued on methods of doing business.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] Indeed, for some time, there were serious doubts as to \xe2\x80\x9cthe patentability of processes per se,\xe2\x80\x9d as distinct from the physical end product or the tools used to perform a process.  <em>Id.,</em> at 581\xe2\x80\x93582.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thomas Jefferson was the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98first administrator of our patent system\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe author of the 1793 Patent Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham</em>, 383 U.

He drafted the 1793 Act, <em>id.</em>, at 7, and, years later, explained that in that Act \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into a system, under which every one might know when his actions were safe and lawful,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 10 (quoting Letter to Issac McPherson, in VI Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181\xe2\x80\x93182 (H.

As the Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress agreed with Jefferson \xe2\x80\xa6 that the courts should develop additional conditions for patentability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham,</em> 383 U.

Thus \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough the Patent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50 times between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear\xe2\x80\x9d of adding statutory requirements of patentability.  <em>Ibid</em>.  For nearly 160 years, Congress retained the term \xe2\x80\x9cuseful arts,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.</em>, Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving \xe2\x80\x9cwide latitude for judicial construction \xe2\x80\xa6 to keep pace with industrial development,\xe2\x80\x9d Berman, Method Claims, 17 J.

The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied.  But there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta: Business methods are not patentable arts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States Credit Sys. Co. </em>v. <em>American Credit Indem.

Between 1790 and 1952, this Court never addressed the patentability of business methods.  But we consistently focused the inquiry on whether an \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d was connected to a machine or physical transformation,[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] an inquiry that would have excluded methods of doing business.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the early 20th century, it was widely understood that a series of steps for conducting business could not be patented.

S., at 309.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Reports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of \xc2\xa7101, it did not purport to define the term \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  The language refers only to \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacture[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmachine[s],\xe2\x80\x9d tangible objects \xe2\x80\x9cmade by man.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not reference the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d category of subject matter (nor could a process be comfortably described as something \xe2\x80\x9c<em>made</em> by man\xe2\x80\x9d).  The language may also be understood merely as defining the term \xe2\x80\x9cinvents\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101.  As Judge Dyk explained in his opinion below, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmade by man\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis reminiscent\xe2\x80\x9d of a 1790\xe2\x80\x99s description of the limits of English patent law, that an \xe2\x80\x9cinvention must be \xe2\x80\x98made by man\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and cannot be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a philosophical principle only, neither organized or capable of being organized\xe2\x80\x99 from a patentable manufacture.\xe2\x80\x9d  545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 976 (quoting <em>Hornblower</em> v. <em>Boulton,</em> 8 T. R. 95, 98 (K.\xe2\x80\x82B. 1799)).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expanding the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting that any series of steps may be patented as a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  If anything, the Act appears to have codified the conclusion that subject matter which was understood not to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of steps for conducting business is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.  Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never ruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business methods.  But we have cast significant doubt on that proposition by giving substantial weight to the machine-or-transformation test, as general methods of doing business do not pass that test.  And more recently, Members of this Court have noted that patents on business methods are of \xe2\x80\x9csuspect validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>eBay Inc.</em> v. <em>MercExchange, L. L.

Although it may be difficult to define with precision what is a patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101, the historical clues converge on one conclusion: A business method is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  And to the extent that there is ambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend patent rights\xe2\x80\x9d into an area that the Patent Act likely was not \xe2\x80\x9cenacted to protect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, 437 U.

Brief for Petitioners 29.  This argument utilizes a flawed method of statutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the 1999 Act.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that intimated business methods could be patented, see <em>State Street</em>,<em> </em>149 F.\xc2\xa03d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit the potential fallout.  Congress passed the 1999 Act, codified at 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7273, which provides a limited defense to claims of patent infringement, see \xc2\xa7273(b), regarding certain \xe2\x80\x9cmethod[s] of doing or conducting business,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7273(a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is apparent, both from the content and history of the Act, that Congress did not in any way ratify <em>State Street </em>(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading of <em>State Street</em>).  The Act merely limited one potential effect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find themselves liable for innocently using methods they assumed could not be patented.  The Act did not purport to amend the limitations in \xc2\xa7101 on eligible subject matter.  Indeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35, which addresses \xe2\x80\x9cPatents and Protection of Patent Rights,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than in Part II, which contains \xc2\xa7101 and addresses \xe2\x80\x9cPatentability of Inventions and Grant of Patents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Particularly because petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the 1999 Act would expand \xc2\xa7101 to cover a category of processes that have not \xe2\x80\x9chistorically been eligible\xe2\x80\x9d for patents, <em>Diehr</em>, 450 U. S., at 184, we should be loathe to conclude that Congress effectively amended \xc2\xa7101 without saying so clearly.  We generally presume that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 468 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999 legislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Price</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/361/304/index.html">361 U. S. 304</a>, 313 (1960).  When a later statute is offered as \xe2\x80\x9can expression of how the \xe2\x80\xa6 Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Congress \xe2\x80\xa6 a half century before,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuch interpretation has very little, if any, significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rainwater</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/590/index.html">356 U.

If anything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Circuit understood \xc2\xa7101 in that manner and that Congress understood what those judges had done.  The Act appears to reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business methods might be patented.  Thus, in the months following <em>State Street</em>, congressional authorities lamented that \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness methods and processes \xe2\x80\xa6 until recently were thought not to be patentable,\xe2\x80\x9d H.\xc2\xa0R.

More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to interpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cwould render \xc2\xa7273 meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>I agree that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Corley</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But it is a different matter altogether when the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to give effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act.  The canon on which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] statute is passed as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa746:5, p. 189 (7th ed. 2007).  But the two statutes in question were not passed as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly, that Congress would not in one statute include two provisions that are at odds with each other.  But as this case shows, that sensible reasoning can break down when applied to different statutes.[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  The 1999 Act was passed to limit the impact of the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s then-recent statements on the 1952 Act.  Although repudiating that judicial dictum (as we should) might effectively render the 1999 Act a nullity going forward, such a holding would not mean that it was a nullity when Congress enacted it.  Section 273 may have been a technically unnecessary response to confusion about patentable subject matter, but it appeared necessary in 1999 in light of what was being discussed in legal circles at the time.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  Consider the logical implications of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this question: If, tomorrow, Congress were to conclude that patents on business methods are so <em>important </em>that the special infringement defense in \xc2\xa7273 ought to be abolished, and thus repealed that provision, this could paradoxically strengthen<em> </em>the case <em>against</em> such patents because there would no longer be a \xc2\xa7273 that \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledges \xe2\x80\xa6 business method patents,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> ante</em>, at 11.  That is not a sound method of statutory interpretation.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of its history and purpose, I think it obvious that the 1999 Congress would never have enacted \xc2\xa7273 if it had foreseen that this Court would rely on the provision as a basis for concluding that business methods are patentable.  Section 273 is a red herring; we should be focusing our attention on \xc2\xa7101 itself.  </p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constitutionally mandated purpose and function of the patent laws bolster the conclusion that methods of doing business are not \xe2\x80\x9cprocesses\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution allows Congress to issue patents \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o promote the Progress of \xe2\x80\xa6 useful Arts,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08.

Although there is certainly disagreement about the need for patents, scholars generally agree that when innovation is expensive, risky, and easily copied, inventors are less likely to undertake the guaranteed costs of innovation in order to obtain the mere possibility of an invention that others can copy.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  Both common sense and recent economic scholarship suggest that these dynamics of cost, risk, and reward vary by the type of thing being patented.[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  And the functional case that patents promote progress generally is stronger for subject matter that has \xe2\x80\x9chistorically been eligible to receive the protection of our patent laws,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Diehr</em>, 450 U.

It generally does not require the same \xe2\x80\x9cenormous costs in terms of time, research, and development,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bicron</em>, 416 U.

Many business methods are practiced in public, and therefore a patent does not necessarily encourage the dissemination of anything not already known.  And for the methods practiced in private, the benefits of disclosure may be small: Many such methods are distributive, not productive\xe2\x80\x94that is, they do not generate any efficiency but only provide a means for competitors to one-up each other in a battle for pieces of the pie.  And as the Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cit is hard to see how the public would be benefited by disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of certain business tools, since the nondisclosure of these tools \xe2\x80\x9cencourages businesses to initiate new and individualized plans of operation,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cin turn, leads to a greater variety of business methods.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bicron</em>, 416 U.

For even when patents encourage innovation and disclosure, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>too much</em> patent protection can impede rather than \xe2\x80\x98promote the Progress of \xe2\x80\xa6 useful Arts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings </em>v. <em>Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/548/124/index.html">548 U. S. 124</a>, 126\xe2\x80\x93127 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari).  Patents \xe2\x80\x9ccan discourage research by impeding the free exchange of information,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, by forcing people to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid the use of potentially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing or pending patents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by raising the costs of using the patented\xe2\x80\x9d methods.  <em>Id.</em>, at 127.  Although \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very patent is the grant of a privilege of exacting tolls from the public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Great Atlantic</em>, 340 U. S., at 154 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on business methods may be especially high.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The primary concern is that patents on business methods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition and innovation.  As one scholar explains, \xe2\x80\x9cit is useful to conceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are on top; specific applications are at the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d Dreyfuss 275.  The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the greater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to further innovation.[<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  Thus, this Court stated in <em>Benson</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]henomena of nature \xe2\x80\xa6 , mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work,\xe2\x80\x9d 409 U.\xe2\x80\x82S., at 67; see also, <em>Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, 180 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 28 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo give appellant a monopoly, through the issuance of a patent, upon so great an area \xe2\x80\xa6 would in our view impose without warrant of law a serious restraint upon the advance of science and industry\xe2\x80\x9d).  Business methods are similarly often closer to \xe2\x80\x9cbig ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are the basic tools of <em>commercial </em>work.  They are also, in many cases, the basic tools of further business innovation: Innovation in business methods is often a sequential and complementary process in which imitation may be a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>spur</em> to innovation\xe2\x80\x9d and patents may \xe2\x80\x9cbecome an <em>impediment</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bessen &amp; Maskin, Sequential Innovation, Patents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J.

Businesses would either live in constant fear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of searching through patents that describe methods of doing business, attempting to decide whether their innovation is one that remains in the public domain.  See Long, Information Costs in Patent and Copyright, 90 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 465, 487\xe2\x80\x93488 (2004) (hereinafter Long).  But as we have long explained, patents should not \xe2\x80\x9cembaras[s] the honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of concealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexatious accountings for profits made in good faith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Works</em> v. <em>Brady</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/192/index.html">107 U.

Yet patents on methods of conducting business generally are composed largely or entirely of intangible steps.  Compared to \xe2\x80\x9cthe kinds of goods\xe2\x80\x82\xe2\x80\xa6 around which patent rules historically developed,\xe2\x80\x9d it thus tends to be more costly and time consuming to search through, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business methods.  See Long 539, 470.[<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in our society, and their potential vagueness also invite a particularly pernicious use of patents that we have long criticized.  As early as the 19th century, we explained that the patent laws are not intended to \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] a class of speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real advancement of the arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atlantic Works</em>, 107 U. S., at 200.  Yet business method patents may have begun to do exactly that.  See <em>eBay Inc.</em>, 547 U. S., at 396\xe2\x80\x93397 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These many costs of business method patents not only may stifle innovation, but they are also likely to \xe2\x80\x9cstifle competition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bonito Boats, </em>489 U. S., at 146.  Even if a business method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent holders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to bully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the costs of a drawn out, fact-intensive patent litigation.[<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>]  That can take a particular toll on small and upstart businesses.[<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to competition for the type of subject matter that is patented.  But patents on business methods are patents on business itself.  Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of patents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the dynamism of the marketplace.[<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constitutional standard for patentability is difficult to apply with any precision, and Congress has significant discretion to \xe2\x80\x9cimplement the stated purpose of the Framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Graham</em>, 383 U.

And as I understand their practical consequences, it is hard to see how they would.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Constitution grants to Congress an important power to promote innovation.  In its exercise of that power, Congress has established an intricate system of intellectual property.  The scope of patentable subject matter under that system is broad.  But it is not endless.  In the absence of any clear guidance from Congress, we have only limited textual, historical, and functional clues on which to rely.  Those clues all point toward the same conclusion: that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7101 because methods of doing business are not, in themselves, covered by the statute.  In my view, acknowledging as much would be a far more sensible and restrained way to resolve this case.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101.  <em>Ante, </em>at 2 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  This Court has never before held that so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness methods\xe2\x80\x9d are patentable, and, in my view, the text, history, and purposes of the Patent Act make clear that they are not.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9347.  I would therefore decide this case on that ground, and I join Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion in full.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I write separately, however, in order to highlight the substantial <em>agreement</em> among many Members<em> </em>of the Court on many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by this case.  In light of the need for clarity and settled law in this highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous agreement that the claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it is my view that the following four points are consistent with both the opinion of the Court and Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion concurring in the judgment:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First, </em>although the text of \xc2\xa7101 is broad, it is not without limit.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion of the Court); <em>ante, </em>at 10 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he underlying policy of the patent system [is] that \xe2\x80\x98the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent,\xe2\x80\x99 . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the limited patent monopoly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Graham</em> v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/1/index.html">383 U. S. 1</a>, 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (1966) (quoting Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washington ed.)).  The Court has thus been careful in interpreting the Patent Act to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine not only what is protected, but also what is free for all to use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bonito Boats, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/141/index.html">489 U. S. 141</a>, 151 (1989).  In particular, the Court has long held that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7101, since allowing individuals to patent these fundamental principles would \xe2\x80\x9cwholly pre-empt\xe2\x80\x9d the public\xe2\x80\x99s access to the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic tools of scientific and technological work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottschalk</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/index.html">409 U. S. 63</a>, 67, 72 (1972); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Diehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/175/index.html">450 U. S. 175</a>, 185 (1981); <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Chakrabarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/303/index.html">447 U. S. 303</a>, 309 (1980).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, in a series of cases that extend back over a century, the Court has stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ransformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is <em>the clue</em> to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 184 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Benson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 70; <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Flook</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/584/index.html">437 U. S. 584</a>, 588, n.\xc2\xa09 (1978); <em>Cochrane</em> v. <em>Deener</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/94/780/index.html">94 U. S. 780</a>, 788 (1877).  Application of this test, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation test,\xe2\x80\x9d has thus repeatedly helped the Court to determine what is \xe2\x80\x9ca patentable \xe2\x80\x98process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Flook</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 589.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, while the machine-or-transformation test has always been a \xe2\x80\x9cuseful and important clue,\xe2\x80\x9d it has never been the \xe2\x80\x9csole test\xe2\x80\x9d for determining patentability.  <em>Ante, </em>at 8; see also <em>ante, </em>at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Benson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 71 (rejecting the argument that \xe2\x80\x9cno process patent could ever qualify\xe2\x80\x9d for protection under \xc2\xa7101 \xe2\x80\x9cif it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation] requirements\xe2\x80\x9d).  Rather, the Court has emphasized that a process claim meets the requirements of \xc2\xa7101 when, \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cis performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect (<em>e.g.</em>, transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 192.  The machine-or-transformation test is thus an <em>important</em> <em>example</em> of how a court can determine patentability under \xc2\xa7101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this case by treating it as the <em>exclusive test</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth</em>, although the machine-or-transformation test is not the only test for patentability, this by no means indicates that anything which produces a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98useful, concrete, and tangible result,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc., </em>149 F.\xc2\xa03d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed. 1998), is patentable.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings</em> v. <em>Metabolite Laboratories</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/124/index.html">548 U. S. 124</a>, 136 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly</em> v. <em>Morse</em>, 15 How. 62, 117 (1854); <em>Flook</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 590.  Indeed, the introduction of the \xe2\x80\x9cuseful, concrete, and tangible result\xe2\x80\x9d approach to patentability, associated with the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>State Street</em> decision, preceded the granting of patents that \xe2\x80\x9cranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Bilski</em>, 545 F.\xc2\xa03d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008) (Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, <em>inter alia</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of training janitors to dust and vacuum using video displays,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9csystem for toilet reservations,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating status in order to limit \xe2\x80\x98the embarrassment of rejection\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9341, and n.\xc2\xa020 (listing dubious patents).  To the extent that the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision should be taken as disapproving of that determination.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16; <em>ante</em>, at 2, n.\xc2\xa01 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the \xe2\x80\x9cmachine-or-transformation\xe2\x80\x9d test is not necessarily the <em>sole </em>test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de-emphasize the test\xe2\x80\x99s usefulness nor to suggest that many patentable processes lie beyond its reach.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s\njudgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
