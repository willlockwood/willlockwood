Section 8(d) of this so-called "rails-to-trails" statute provides that a railroad wishing to cease operations along a particular route may negotiate with a State, municipality, or private group prepared to assume financial and managerial responsibility for the right-of-way.  If the parties reach agreement, the land may, subject to ICC-imposed terms and conditions, be transferred to the trail operator for interim trail use notwithstanding whatever reversionary interests may exist in the property under state law.  If no agreement is reached, the railroad may abandon the line entirely, thereby allowing the property to revert to abutting landowners if the terms of applicable easements and state law provide for such reversion.  After Vermont Railway, Inc., stopped using a right-of-way adjacent to petitioners\' land in Vermont, petitioners brought a state court quiet title action, alleging that the railroad\'s easement had been abandoned and thus extinguished, and that the right-of-way had therefore reverted to them under state law.

Even if the rails-to-trails statute gives rise to a taking, compensation is available under the Tucker Act, and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment are therefore satisfied.  Since the Amendments and their legislative history do not mention the Tucker Act -- which provides Claims Court jurisdiction over claims against the Government to recover damages founded on, <em>inter alia,</em> the Constitution -- the Amendments do not exhibit the type of "unambiguous intention" to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy that is necessary to preclude a claim under that Act.  <em>See Ruckelshaus v.

Since \xc2\xa7 8(d) speaks in capacious terms of interim use of <em>any</em> right-of-way, it clearly authorizes conversions giving rise to just compensation claims, and therefore does not support petitioners\' contention.  That there is no explicit promise to pay for any takings is irrelevant, since the Tucker Act constitutes an implied promise to pay just compensation which individual laws need not reiterate.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7 101 speaks only to payments under the Amendments themselves, and not to takings claims that "arise" under the Fifth Amendment and for which payments are made "under" the Tucker Act from the separately appropriated Judgment Fund.  Nor do statements in the legislative history indicating Congress\' desire that the Amendments operate at "low cost" demonstrate an unambiguous intent to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy, since a generalized desire to protect the public fisc is insufficient for that purpose, <em>see, e.g., Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html">419 U.

The stated congressional purposes -- (1) to encourage the development of additional recreational trails on an interim basis and (2) to preserve established railroad rights-of-way for future reactivation of rail service -- are valid objectives to which the Amendments are reasonably adapted.  Even if petitioners were correct that the rail banking purpose is a sham concealing a true purpose of preventing reversion of rights-of-way to property owners after abandonment, the Amendments would still be valid because they are reasonably adapted to the goal of encouraging the development of additional trails.  There is no requirement that a law serve more than one legitimate purpose.  Moreover, this Court is not free under the applicable rational basis standard of review to hold the Amendments invalid simply because the rail banking purpose might be advanced more completely by measures more Draconian than \xc2\xa7 8(d) -- such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of <em>all</em> abandonments.  The long history of congressional attempts to address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason to defer to the legislative judgment that \xc2\xa7 8(d) is an appropriate answer.  Furthermore, in light of that history, Congress was entitled to make the judgment that every line is a potentially valuable national asset meriting preservation even if no future rail use for it is currently foreseeable, so that the fact that the ICC must certify that public convenience and necessity permit abandonment before granting an interim trail use permit does not indicate that the statute fails to promote its purpose of preserving rail corridors.

Petitioners contend that the statute violates both the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause and the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8.  We find it unnecessary to evaluate the merits of the taking claim because we hold that, even if the rails-to-trails statute gives rise to a taking, compensation is available to petitioners under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 494 U. S. 5</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 1491(a)(1) (1982 ed.), and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment are satisfied.  We also hold that the statute is a valid exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The statute at issue in this case, the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983 (Amendments), Pub.L. 98-11, 97 Stat. 48, to the National Trails System Act (Trails Act), Pub.L. 90-543, 82 Stat. 919 (<em>codified, as amended,</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1241 <em>et seq.</em>), is the culmination of congressional efforts to preserve shrinking rail trackage by converting unused rights-of-way to recreational trails. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1920, the Nation\'s railway system reached its peak of 272,000 miles; today only about 141,000 miles are in use, and experts predict that 3,000 miles will be abandoned every year through the end of this century. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Concerned about the loss of trackage, Congress included in the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act), Pub.L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 144, <em>as amended,</em> 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10906 (1982 ed.), several provisions aimed at promoting the conversion of abandoned [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] lines </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 494 U. S. 6</a></p><p> to trails.  Section 809(a) of the 4-R Act required the Secretary of Transportation to prepare a report on alternative uses for abandoned railroad rights-of-way.  Section 809(b) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to encourage conversion of abandoned rights-of-way to recreational and conservational uses through financial, educational, and technical assistance to local, state, and federal agencies.  <em>See</em> note following 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10906 (1982 ed.).  Section 809(c) authorized the ICC to delay the disposition of rail property for up to 180 days after the effective date of an order permitting abandonment, unless the property had first been offered for sale on reasonable terms for public purposes, including recreational use.  <em>See</em> 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10906.</p>\n<p>By 1983, Congress recognized that these measures</p>\n<p>"ha[d] not been successful in establishing a process through which railroad rights-of-way which are not immediately necessary for active service can be utilized for trail purposes."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 98-28, p. 8 (1983) (H.R.Rep.); S.Rep. No. 98-1, p. 9 (1983) (S.Rep.) (same), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1983, pp. 112, 119.  Congress enacted the Amendments to the Trails Act, which authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) to preserve for possible future railroad use rights-of-way not currently in service and to allow interim use of the land as recreational trails.  Section 8(d) provides that a railroad wishing to cease operations along a particular route may negotiate with a State, municipality, or private group that is prepared to assume </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 494 U. S. 7</a></p><p> financial and managerial responsibility for the right-of-way. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  If the parties reach agreement, the land may be transferred to the trail operator for interim trail use, subject to ICC-imposed terms and conditions; if no agreement is reached, the railroad may abandon the line entirely and liquidate its interest. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 494 U. S. 8</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Section 8(d) of the amended Trails Act provides that interim trail use</p>\n<p>"shall not be treated, for any purposes of any law or rule of law, as an abandonment of the use of such rights-of-way for railroad purposes."</p>\n<p>16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1247(d).  This language gives rise to a taking question in the typical rails-to-trails case because many railroads do not own their rights-of-way outright, but rather hold them under easements or similar property interests.  While the terms of these easements and applicable state law vary, frequently the easements provide that the property reverts to the abutting landowner upon abandonment of rail operations.  State law generally governs the disposition of reversionary interests, subject of course to the ICC\'s "exclusive and plenary" jurisdiction to regulate abandonments, <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/311/case.html">450 U.

By deeming interim trail use to be like discontinuance, rather than abandonment, <em>see</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra,</em> Congress prevented property interests from reverting under state law:</p>\n<p>"The key finding of this amendment is that interim use of a railroad right-of-way for trail use, when the route itself remains intact for future railroad purposes, shall not constitute an abandonment of such rights-of-way for railroad purposes.  This finding alone should eliminate many of the problems with this program.  The concept of attempting to establish trails only after the formal abandonment of a railroad right-of-way is self-defeating; once a right-of-way is abandoned for railroad purposes there may be nothing left for trail use.  This amendment would ensure that potential interim trail use will be considered prior to abandonment."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. at 8-9.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 494 U. S. 9</a></p><p> <em>See</em> S.Rep. at 9 (same).  The primary issue in this case is whether Congress has violated the Fifth Amendment by precluding reversion of state property interests.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners claim a reversionary interest in a railroad right-of-way adjacent to their land in Vermont.  In 1962, the State of Vermont acquired the Rutland-Canadian Railway Company\'s interest in the right-of-way and then leased the right-of-way to Vermont Railway, Inc.  Vermont Railway stopped using the route more than a decade ago, and has since removed all railroad equipment, including switches, bridges, and track, from the portion of the right-of-way claimed by petitioners.  In 1981, petitioners brought a quiet-title action in the Superior Court of Chittenden County, alleging that the easement had been abandoned and was thus extinguished, and that the right-of-way had reverted to them by operation of state property law.  In August, 1983, the Superior Court dismissed the action, holding that it lacked jurisdiction because the ICC had not authorized abandonment of the route, and therefore still exercised exclusive jurisdiction over it.  The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  <em>Trustees of the Diocese of Vermont v. State,</em> 145 Vt. 510, 496 A.2d 151 (1985).</p>\n<p>Petitioners then sought a certificate of abandonment of the rail line from the ICC.  The State of Vermont intervened, claiming title in fee simple to the right-of-way and arguing in the alternative that, even if the State\'s interest were an easement, the land could not revert while it was still being used for a public purpose.  Vermont Railway and the State then petitioned the ICC to permit the railroad to discontinue rail service and transfer the right-of-way to the City of Burlington for interim use as a public trail under \xc2\xa7 8(d) of the Trails Act.  By a Notice of Exemption decided January 2, 1986, the ICC allowed the railroad to discontinue service and approved the agreement between the State and the City for interim trail use.  <em>See</em> 51 Fed.Reg. 454-455.  On February 4, 1986, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 494 U. S. 10</a></p><p> ICC Chairman denied petitioners\' application for a stay pending administrative review, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the decision became effective on February 5, 1986.  Petitioners\' motion for reconsideration and/or clarification was denied on July 17. 1987.  The Commission noted that</p>\n<p>"[i]nevitably, interim trail use will conflict with the reversionary rights of adjacent landowners, but that is the very purpose of the Trails Act."</p>\n<p><em>State of Vermont and Vermont Railway, Inc. -- Discontinuance of Service Exemption in Chittenden County,</em> 3 I.C.C.2d 903, 908.</p>\n<p>Petitioners sought review of the ICC\'s order in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, arguing that \xc2\xa7 8(d) of the Trails Act is unconstitutional on its face because it takes private property without just compensation and because it is not a valid exercise of Congress\' Commerce Clause power.  The Court of Appeals rejected both arguments.  853 F.2d 145 (1988).  It reasoned that the ICC has "plenary and exclusive authority" over abandonments, <em>id.</em> at 151, and that federal law must be considered in determining the property right held by petitioners.</p>\n<p>"For as long as it determines that the land will serve a \'railroad purpose,\' the ICC retains jurisdiction over railroad rights-of-way; it does not matter whether that purpose is immediate or in the future."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Because the court believed that no reversionary interest could vest until the ICC determined that abandonment was appropriate, the court concluded that the Trails Act did not result in a taking.  Next, the court found that the Trails Act was reasonably adapted to two legitimate congressional purposes under the commerce Clause:  "preserving rail corridors for future railroad use" and "permitting public recreational use of trails."  <em>Id.</em> at 150.  The Court of Appeals therefore dismissed petitioners\' Commerce Clause challenge.  We granted certiorari.  490 U.S. 1034 (1989). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 494 U.

The proper inquiry is not whether the statute "expresses an affirmative showing of congressional intent to permit recourse to a Tucker Act remedy," but rather</p>\n<p>"whether Congress has in the [statute] <em>withdrawn</em> the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction to the [Claims Court] to hear a suit involving the [statute] \'founded . . . upon the Constitution.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#126">419 U.

Congress did not exhibit the type of "unambiguous intention to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy," <em>Monsanto,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1019">467 U.

As indirect evidence of Congress\' intent to prevent recourse to the Tucker Act, petitioners point to \xc2\xa7 101 of the Amendments, which, although it was not codified into law, provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<p>"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, authority to enter into contracts, and to make payments, under this Act shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 494 U. S. 13</a></p><p> Acts."</p>\n<p>97 Stat. 42, note following 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1249.  Petitioners contend that this section limits the ICC\'s authority for conversions to those not requiring the expenditure of any funds and to those others for which funds had been appropriated in advance.  Thus, any conversion that could result in Claims Court litigation was not authorized by Congress, since payment for such an acquisition would not have been approved by Congress in advance.  Petitioners insist that such <em>unauthorized</em> government actions cannot create Tucker Act liability, citing <em>Hooe v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/218/322/case.html">218 U. S. 322</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/218/322/case.html#335">218 U.

S. 127</a></span>, n. 16.</p>\n<p>We need not decide what types of official authorization, if any, are necessary to create federal liability under the Fifth Amendment, because we find that rail-to-trail conversions giving rise to just compensation claims are clearly authorized by \xc2\xa7 8(d).  That section speaks in capacious terms of trail "interim use of <em>any</em> established railroad rights-of-way" (emphasis added) and does not support petitioners\' proposed distinction between conversions that might result in a taking and those that do not.  Although Congress did not explicitly promise to pay for any takings, we have always assumed that the Tucker Act is an "implie[d] promis[e]" to pay just compensation which individual laws need not reiterate.  <em>Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/18/case.html">309 U.

Petitioners\' argument that specific congressional authorization is required for those conversions that might result in takings is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the established method for determining whether Tucker Act relief is available for claims arising out of takings pursuant to a federal statute.  We reaffirm that a Tucker Act remedy exists unless there are unambiguous indications to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Section 101, moreover, speaks only to appropriations under the Amendments themselves, and not to relief available </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 494 U. S. 14</a></p><p> under the Tucker Act, as evidenced by \xc2\xa7 101\'s opening clause -- "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of <em>this</em> Act" (emphasis added) -- which refers to the 1983 Amendments.  The section means simply that payments made pursuant to the Amendments, such as funding for scenic trails, markers, and similar purposes, <em>see</em> Amendments \xc2\xa7 209(5)(c), 97 Stat. 49 (<em>codified at</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1249(c)(2)) (authorizing appropriations for the development and administration of certain National Scenic and National Historic Trails), are effective only "in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts," a concept that mirrors Art. 1, \xc2\xa7 9, of the Constitution ("No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law").  Payments for takings claims are not affected by this language, because such claims "arise" under the Fifth Amendment, <em>see First English Evangelical Lutheran Church,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html#315">482 U. S. 315</a></span>-316.  Payments for takings would be made "under" the Tucker Act, not the Trails Act, and would be drawn from the Judgment Fund, which is a separate appropriated account, <em>see</em> 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1304(a) (1982 ed.).  Section 101 does not manifest the type of clear and unmistakable congressional intent necessary to withdraw Tucker Act coverage.</p>\n<p>Petitioners next assert that Congress\' desire that the Amendments operate at "low cost," H.R.Rep., at 3, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1983, p. 114, somehow indicates that Congress withdrew the Tucker Act remedy.  There is no doubt that Congress meant to keep the costs of the Amendments to a minimum. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  This intent, however, has little bearing on the Tucker Act question.  We </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 494 U. S. 15</a></p><p> have previously rejected the argument that a generalized desire to protect the public fisc is sufficient to withdraw relief under the Tucker Act.  In the <em>Railroad Reorganization Act Cases,</em> we recognized that the Rail Act established "[m]aximum" funding authorizations, 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#127">419 U. S. 127</a></span>-128, but we nevertheless held that those limits were not an unambiguous repeal of the Tucker Act remedy.  We reasoned that the maximum limits might "support the inference that Congress was so convinced that the huge sums provided would surely equal or exceed the required constitutional minimum that it never focused upon the possible need for a suit in the Court of Claims."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#128">419 U. S. 128</a></span>.  In <em>Monsanto,</em> we stated that:</p>\n<p>"Congress in [the statute] did not address the liability of the Government to pay just compensation should a taking occur.  Congress\' failure specifically to mention or provide for recourse against the Government may reflect a congressional belief that use of data by [the Government] in the ways authorized by [the statute] effects no Fifth Amendment taking or it may reflect Congress\' assumption that the general grant of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act would provide the necessary remedy for any taking that may occur.  In any event, the failure cannot be construed to reflect an unambiguous intention to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy."</p>\n<p>467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1018">467 U. S. 1018</a></span>-1019.  Similar logic applies to the instant case.  The statements made in Congress during the passage of the Trails Act Amendments might reflect merely the decision not to create a program of direct federal purchase, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] construction, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 494 U. S. 16</a></p><p> maintenance of trails, and instead to allow state and local governments and private groups to establish and manage trails.  The alternative chosen by Congress is less costly than a program of direct federal trail acquisition because, under any view of takings law, only some rail-to-trail conversions will amount to takings.  Some rights-of-way are held in fee simple.  <em>See National Wildlife Federation v. ICC,</em> 271 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 10, 850 F.2d 694, 703 (1988).  Others are held as easements that do not even as a matter of state law revert upon interim use as nature trails. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In addition, under \xc2\xa7 8(d) the Federal Government neither incurs the costs of constructing and maintaining the trails nor assumes legal liability for the transfer or use of the right-of-way.  In contrast, the costs of acquiring and administering National Scenic and National Historic Trails are borne directly by the Federal Government.  <em>See</em> n. 1, <em>supra.</em>  Thus, the "low cost" language might reflect Congress\' rejection of a more ambitious program of federally owned and managed trails, rather than withdrawal of a Tucker Act remedy.  The language does not amount to the "unambiguous intention" required by our prior cases. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 494 U. S. 17</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In sum, petitioners\' failure to make use of the available Tucker Act remedy renders their taking challenge to the ICC\'s order premature.  We need not decide whether a taking occurred in this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners also contend that the Amendments to the Trails Act are not a valid exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, because the true purpose of \xc2\xa7 8(d) is to prevent reversion of railroad rights-of-way to property owners after abandonment and to create recreational trails, rather than to preserve rail corridors for future railroad use.  We evaluate this claim under the traditional rationality standard of review:  we must defer to a congressional finding that a regulated activity affects interstate commerce "if there is any rational basis for such a finding," <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html">452 U.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/241/case.html">379 U.

The Amendments clearly pass muster.\n</em></p>\n<p>Two congressional purposes are evident.  First, Congress intended to "encourage the development of additional trails" and to "assist recreation[al] users by providing opportunities for trail use on an interim basis."  H.R.Rep. at 8, 9; S.Rep. at 9, 10 (same), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1983, p. 119; <em>see also</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1241(a) (Trails Act "promote[s] the preservation of, public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, out-door </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 494 U. S. 18</a></p><p> areas and historic resources of the Nation").  Second, Congress intended</p>\n<p>"to preserve established railroad rights-of-way for future reactivation of rail service, to protect rail transportation corridors, and to encourage energy efficient transportation use."</p>\n<p>H.Rep. at 8; S.Rep. at 9, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1983, p. 119; <em>see also</em> 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1247(d).  These are valid congressional objectives to which the Amendments are reasonably adapted.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that the Amendments do not reasonably promote the latter purpose because the ICC cannot authorize trail use until it has found that the right-of-way at issue is not necessary for "present <em>or future</em> public convenience and necessity."  49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10903(a) (1982 ed.) (emphasis added).  The ICC has explained that:</p>\n<p>"In every Trails Act case, we will already have found that the public convenience and necessity permit abandonment (or that regulatory approval is not required under 49 U.S.C. 10505)."</p>\n<p>54 Fed.Reg. 8012, n. 3 (1989).  Thus, trail conversion is permitted only <em>after</em> the Commission determines that rail service will not be not needed in the foreseeable future.  This, according to petitioners, reveals that the rail banking rationale is a sham.  If Congress really wished to address the problem of shrinking trackage, it would not have left conversions to voluntary agreements between railroads and State and local agencies or private groups.  Rather, petitioners suggest, Congress would have created a mandatory program administered directly by the ICC.</p>\n<p>We note at the outset that, even under petitioners\' reading, the Amendments would still be a valid exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause because they are reasonably adapted to the goal of encouraging the development of additional recreational trails.  There is no requirement that a law serve more than one legitimate purpose.  Moreover, we are not at liberty under the rational basis standard of review to hold the Amendments invalid merely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 494 U. S. 19</a></p><p> because more Draconian measures -- such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of all abandonments -- might advance more completely the rail banking purpose.  The process of legislating often involves tradeoffs, compromises, and imperfect solutions, and our ability to imagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of Congress\' ends does not render it irrational.  <em>See, e.g., Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/456/case.html">449 U. S. 456</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/456/case.html#469">449 U. S. 469</a></span> (1981).  The history of congressional attempts to address the problem of rail abandonments, <em>see supra</em> at 918-919, provides sufficient reason to defer to the legislative judgment that \xc2\xa7 8(d) is an appropriate answer.  Here, as in <em>Hodel,</em> "Congress considered the effectiveness of existing,legislation and concluded that additional measures were necessary."  452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/case.html#283">452 U. S. 283</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' argument that \xc2\xa7 8(d) does not serve the rail banking purpose, moreover, is not well taken.  That the ICC must certify that public convenience and necessity permit abandonment before granting a CITU or NITU does not indicate that the statute fails to promote its purpose of preserving rail corridors.  Congress did not distinguish between short-term and long-term rail banking, nor did it require that the Commission develop a specific contingency plan for reactivation of a line before permitting conversion.  To the contrary, Congress apparently believed that every line is a potentially valuable national asset that merits preservation even if no future rail use for it is currently foreseeable.  Given the long tradition of congressional regulation of railroad abandonments, <em>see, e.g., Colorado v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/271/153/case.html">271 U. S. 153</a></span> (1926), that is a judgment that Congress is entitled to make.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 494 U.

Section 7(e) of the Trails Act, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1246(e), provides that the land necessary for a designated scenic or historic trail may be acquired by state or local governments or by federal authorities, either through cooperative agreements with landowners or by purchase.

Today the Court affirms the Second Circuit\'s judgment on quite different grounds.  I join the Court\'s opinion, but write separately to express my view that state law determines what property interest petitioners possess, and that traditional takings doctrine will determine whether the Government must compensate petitioners for the burden imposed on any property interest they possess.</p>\n<p>As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/1/case.html#8">494 U.

As the Vermont Supreme Court recognized, state courts cannot enforce or give effect to asserted reversionary interests when enforcement would interfere with the Commission\'s administration of the Interstate Commerce Act.  <em>See Trustees of the Diocese of Vermont v. State,</em> 145 Vt. 510, 496 A.2d 151 (1985).  These results are simply routine and well established consequences of the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p>The scope of the Commission\'s authority to regulate abandonments, thereby delimiting the ambit of federal power, is an issue quite distinct from whether the Commission\'s exercise of power over matters within its jurisdiction effected a taking of petitioners\' property.  <em>Cf. Kaiser Aetna v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html">444 U. S. 164</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html#174">444 U. S. 174</a></span> (1979) ("[T]here is no question but that Congress could assure the public a free right of access. . . .  Whether a statute or regulation that went so far amounted to a <em>taking,\' however, is an entirely separate question").  Although the Commission\'s actions may preempt the operation and effect of certain state laws, those actions do not displace state law as the traditional source of the real property interests.  <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1003">467 U.

S. 1012</a></span> (state law creates property right in trade secrets for purposes of Fifth Amendment, and regulatory regime does not preempt state property law).  The Commission\'s actions may delay property owners\' enjoyment of their reversionary interests, but that delay burdens and defeats the property interest rather than suspends or defers the vesting of those property rights.   <em>See National Wildlife Federation v. ICC,</em> 271 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 11-12, and n. 16, 850 F.2d 694, 704-705, and n. 16 (1988).  Any other conclusion would convert the ICC\'s power to preempt conflicting state regulation of interstate commerce into the power to preempt the rights guaranteed by state property law, a result incompatible with the Fifth Amendment.  <em>See Ruckelshaus</em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 494 U.

S. 164</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adopted just this unjustified interpretation of the effect of the ICC\'s exercise of federal power.  The court concluded that, even if petitioners held the reversionary interest they claim, no taking occurred because "no reversionary interest can or would vest" until the ICC determines that abandonment is appropriate.  <em>See</em> 853 F.2d 145, 151 (1988).  This view conflates the scope of the ICC\'s power with the existence of a compensable taking and threatens to read the Just Compensation Clause out of the Constitution.  The ICC may possess the power to postpone enjoyment of reversionary interests, but the Fifth Amendment and well established doctrine indicate that, in certain circumstances, the Government must compensate owners of those property interests when it exercises that power.  <em>See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html">482 U. S. 304</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html#314">482 U. S. 314</a></span>-315 (1987) (The Taking Clause "does not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power," and the Clause "is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights <em>per se,</em> but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking").  Nothing in the Court\'s opinion disavows these principles.  The Court\'s conclusion that section 8(d) authorizes rails-to-trails conversions that amount to takings, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/1/case.html#13">494 U. S. 13</a></span>, and its conclusion that "under any view of takings law, only some rail-to-trail conversions will amount to takings," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/1/case.html#16">494 U. S. 16</a></span>, are inconsistent with the Second Circuit\'s view.  Indeed, if the Second Circuit\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 494 U. S. 24</a></p><p> approach were adopted, discussion of the availability of the Tucker Act remedy would be unnecessary.  Even the federal respondent acknowledges that the existence of a taking will rest upon the nature of the state-created property interest that petitioners would have enjoyed absent the federal action and upon the extent that the federal action burdened that interest.  <em>See</em> Brief for Federal Respondents 23-24.</p>\n<p>Well established principles will govern analysis of whether the burden the ICC\'s actions impose upon state-defined real property interests amounts to a compensable taking.  We recently concluded in <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html">483 U. S. 825</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html#831">483 U.

In such a case, a "permanent physical occupation" of the underlying property\n</em></p>\n<p>"has occurred . . . where individuals are given a permanent and continuous right to pass to and fro, so that the real property may continuously be traversed, even though no particular individual is permitted to station himself permanently upon the premises."</p>\n<p><em>Nollan, supra,</em> 483 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/case.html#832">483 U.

The Government\'s appropriation of other, lesser servitudes may also impose a burden requiring payment of just compensation.  <em>See United States v.

And the Court recently concluded that the Government\'s burdening of property for a distinct period, short of a permanent taking, may nevertheless mandate compensation.  <em>See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, supra,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/case.html#318">482 U.
