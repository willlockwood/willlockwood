JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-1 <em>et seq.,</em> was enacted to deal with abuses that Congress had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 444 U. S. 13</a></p><p> found to exist in the investment advisers industry.  The question in this case is whether that Act creates a private cause of action for damages or other relief in favor of persons aggrieved by those who allegedly have violated it.</p>\n<p>The respondent, a shareholder of petitioner Mortgage Trust of America (Trust), brought this suit in a Federal District Court as a derivative action on behalf of the Trust and as a class action on behalf of the Trust\'s shareholders.  Named as defendants were the Trust, several individual trustees, the Trust\'s investment adviser, Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.(TAMA), and two corporations affiliated with TAMA, Land Capital, Inc. (Land Capital), and Transamerica Corp. (Transamerica), all of which are petitioners in this case. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondent\'s complaint alleged that the petitioners, in the course of advising or managing the Trust, had been guilty of various frauds and breaches of fiduciary duty.  The complaint set out three causes of action, each said to arise under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The first alleged that the advisory contract between TAMA and the Trust was unlawful because TAMA and Transamerica were not registered under the Act and because the contract had provided for grossly excessive compensation.  The second alleged that the petitioners breached their fiduciary duty to the Trust by causing it to purchase securities of inferior quality from Land Capital.  The third alleged that the petitioners had misappropriated profitable investment opportunities for the benefit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 444 U. S. 14</a></p><p> of other companies affiliated with Transamerica.  The complaint sought injunctive relief to restrain further performance of the advisory contract, rescission of the contract, restitution of fees and other considerations paid by the Trust, an accounting of illegal profits, and an award of damages.</p>\n<p>The trial court ruled that the Investment Advisers Act confers no private right of action, and accordingly dismissed the complaint. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court of Appeals reversed, <em>Lewis v. Transamerica Corp.,</em> 575 F.2d 237, holding that</p>\n<p>"implication of a private right of action for injunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to achieve the goals of Congress in enacting the legislation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 239. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We granted certiorari to consider the important federal question presented.  439 U.S. 952.</p>\n<p>The Investment Advisers Act nowhere expressly provides for a private cause of action.  The only provision of the Act that authorizes any suits to enforce the duties or obligations created by it is \xc2\xa7 209, which permits the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) to bring suit in a federal district court to enjoin violations of the Act or the rules promulgated under it. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The argument is made, however, that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 444 U. S. 15</a></p><p> clients of investment advisers were the intended beneficiaries of the Act and that courts should therefore imply a private cause of action in their favor.  <em>See Cannon v.

While some opinions of the Court have placed considerable emphasis upon the desirability of implying private rights of action in order to provide remedies thought to effectuate the purposes of a given statute, <em>e.g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, supra,</em> what must ultimately be determined is whether Congress intended to create the private remedy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 444 U. S. 16</a></p><p> asserted, as our recent decisions have made clear.  <em>Touche Ross  Co. v.

We accept this as the appropriate inquiry to be made in resolving the issues presented by the case before us.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we begin with the language of the statute itself.  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

It is asserted that the creation of a private right of action can fairly be inferred from the language of two sections of the Act.  The first is \xc2\xa7 206, which broadly proscribes fraudulent practices by investment advisers, making it unlawful for any investment adviser</p>\n<p>"to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud . . . [or] to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client,"</p>\n<p>or to engage in specified transactions with clients without making required disclosures. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The second is \xc2\xa7 215, which provides that contracts whose formation or performance would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 444 U. S. 17</a></p><p> violate the Act "shall be void . . . as regards the rights of" the violator and knowing successors in interest. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>It is apparent that the two sections were intended to benefit the clients of investment advisers, and, in the case of \xc2\xa7 215, the parties to advisory contracts as well.  As we have previously recognized, \xc2\xa7 206 establishes "federal fiduciary standards" to govern the conduct of investment advisers, <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/462/case.html#471">430 U. S. 471</a></span>, n. 11; <em>Burks v. Lasker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/471/case.html">441 U.

Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/180/case.html">375 U. S. 180</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/180/case.html#191">375 U. S. 191</a></span>-192.  Indeed, the Act\'s legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended to impose enforceable fiduciary obligations.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 2639, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 28 (1940); S.Rep. No. 1775, 76th </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 444 U. S. 18</a></p><p> Cong., 3d Sess., 21 (1940); SEC, Report on Investment Trusts and Investment Companies (Investment Counsel and Investment Advisory Services), H.R. Doc No. 477, 76th Cong., 2d Sess., 27-30 (1939).  But whether Congress intended additionally that these provisions would be enforced through private litigation is a different question.</p>\n<p>On this question, the legislative history of the Act is entirely silent -- a state of affairs not surprising when it is remembered that the Act concededly does not explicitly provide any private remedies whatever.  <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#694">441 U. S. 694</a></span>.  But while the absence of anything in the legislative history that indicates an intention to confer any private right of action is hardly helpful to the respondent, it does not automatically undermine his position.  This Court has held that the failure of Congress expressly to consider a private remedy is not inevitably inconsistent with an intent on its part to make such a remedy available.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Such an intent may appear implicitly in the language or structure of the statute, or in the circumstances of its enactment.</p>\n<p>In the case of \xc2\xa7 215, we conclude that the statutory language itself fairly implies a right to specific and limited relief in a federal court.  By declaring certain contracts void, \xc2\xa7 215, by its terms, necessarily contemplates that the issue of voidness under its criteria may be litigated somewhere.  At the very least, Congress must have assumed that \xc2\xa7 215 could be raised defensively in private litigation to preclude the enforcement of an investment advisers contract.  But the legal consequences of voidness are typically not so limited.  A person with the power to avoid a contract ordinarily may resort to a court to have the contract rescinded and to obtain restitution of consideration paid.  <em>See Deckert v. Independence Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/282/case.html">311 U. S. 282</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/311/282/case.html#289">311 U. S. 289</a></span>; S. Williston, Contracts \xc2\xa7 1525 (3d ed.1970); J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 881 and 1092 (4th ed.1918).  And this Court has previously recognized that a comparable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 444 U. S. 19</a></p><p> provision, \xc2\xa7 29(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78cc(b), confers a "right to rescind" a contract void under the criteria of the statute.  <em>Mills v. Electric Ato-Lite Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html">396 U. S. 375</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/375/case.html#388">396 U. S. 388</a></span>.  Moreover, the federal courts in general have viewed such language as implying an equitable cause of action for rescission or similar relief.  <em>E.g., Kardon v. National Gypsum Co.,</em> 69 F.Supp. 512, 514 (ED Pa.1946); see 3 L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1758-1759 (2d ed.1961).  <em>Cf. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html">421 U. S. 723</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html#735">421 U. S. 735</a></span>.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that, when Congress declared in \xc2\xa7 215 that certain contracts are void, it intended that the customary legal incidents of voidness would follow, including the availability of a suit for rescission or for an injunction against continued operation of the contract, and for restitution. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Accordingly, we hold that the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling that the respondent may maintain an action on behalf of the Trust seeking to void the investment advisers contract. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>We view quite differently, however, the respondent\'s claims for damages and other monetary relief under \xc2\xa7 206.  Unlike \xc2\xa7 215, \xc2\xa7 206 simply proscribes certain conduct, and does not, in terms, create or alter any civil liabilities.  If monetary liability to a private plaintiff is to be found, it must be read into the Act.  Yet it is an elemental canon of statutory construction that, where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 444 U.

Congress expressly provided both judicial and administrative means for enforcing compliance with \xc2\xa7 206.  First, under \xc2\xa7 217, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-17, willful violations of the Act are criminal offenses, punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both.  Second, \xc2\xa7 209 authorizes the Commission to bring civil actions in federal courts to enjoin compliance with the Act, including, of course, \xc2\xa7 206.  Third, the Commission is authorized by \xc2\xa7 203 to impose various administrative sanctions on persons who violate the Act, including \xc2\xa7 20.  In view of these express provisions for enforcing the duties imposed by \xc2\xa7 206, it is highly improbable that "Congress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action."  <em>Cannon v.

But what evidence of intent exists in this case, circumstantial though it be, weighs against the implication of a private right of action for a monetary award in a case such as this.  Under each of the securities laws that preceded the Act here in question, and under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which was enacted as companion legislation, Congress expressly authorized private suits for damages in prescribed circumstances. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  For example, Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 444 U.

The fact that it enacted no analogous provisions in the legislation here at issue strongly suggests that Congress was simply unwilling to impose any potential monetary liability on a private suitor.  <em>See Abrahamson v. Fleschner,</em> 568 F.2d 862, 883 (CA2 1977) (Gurfein, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p>The omission of any such potential remedy from the Act\'s substantive provisions was paralleled in the jurisdictional section, \xc2\xa7 214. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Early drafts of the bill had simply incorporated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 444 U. S. 22</a></p><p> by reference a provision of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which gave the federal courts jurisdiction "of all suits in equity and <em>actions at law</em> brought to enforce any <em>liability</em> or duty created by" the statute (emphasis added).  <em>See</em> S. 3580, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 40(a), 203 (introduced by Sen.

After hearings on the bill in the Senate, representatives of the investment advisers industry and the staff of the Commission met to discuss the bill, and certain changes were made.  The language that was enacted as \xc2\xa7 214 first appeared in this compromise version of the bill.  <em>See</em> Confidential Committee Print, S. 3580, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., \xc2\xa7 213 (1940).  That version, and the version finally enacted into law, S. 4108, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., \xc2\xa7 214 (1940), both omitted any references to "actions at law" or to "liability." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The unexplained deletion of a single phrase from a jurisdictional provision is, of course, not determinative of whether a private remedy exists.  But it is one more piece of evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize a cause of action for anything beyond limited equitable relief.

Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>, the respondent and the Commission, as <em>amicus curiae,</em> argue that our inquiry in this case cannot stop with the intent of Congress, but must consider the utility of a private remedy, and the fact that it may be one not traditionally relegated to state law.  We rejected the same contentions last Term in <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington,</em> where it was argued that these factors, standing alone, justified the implication of a private right of action under \xc2\xa7 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  We said in that case:</p>\n<p>"It is true that, in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> the Court set forth four factors that it considered \'relevant\' in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one.  But the Court did not decide that each of these factors is entitled to equal weight.  The central inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 444 U. S. 24</a></p><p> of action.  Indeed, the first three factors discussed in <em>Cort</em> -- the language and focus of the statute, its legislative history, and its purpose, <em>see</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U.

S. 575</a></span>-576.</p>\n<p>The statute in <em>Touche Ross,</em> by its terms, neither granted private rights to the members of any identifiable class nor proscribed any conduct as unlawful.  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#576">442 U. S. 576</a></span>.  In those circumstances, it was evident to the Court that no private remedy was available.  Section 206 of the Act here involved concededly was intended to protect the victims of the fraudulent practices it prohibited.  But the mere fact that the statute was designed to protect advisers\' clients does not require the implication of a private cause of action for damages on their behalf.  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/42/case.html#57">442 U. S. 57</a></span>; <em>Cannon v.

The dispositive question remains whether Congress intended to create any such remedy.  Having answered that question in the negative, our inquiry is at an end.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold that there exists a limited private remedy under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to void an investment advisers contract, but that the Act confers no other private causes of action, legal or equitable.

But the respondent concedes that the language of \xc2\xa7 214 was probably narrowed in view of the absence from the Investment Advisers Act of any express provision for a private cause of action for damages.

In reaching this decision, the Court departs from established principles governing the implication of private rights of action by confusing the inquiry into the existence of a right of action with the question of available relief.  By holding that damages are unavailable to victims of violations of the Act, the Court rejects the conclusion of every United States Court of Appeals that has considered the question.  <em>Abrahamson v.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  In  215(b) of the Act, Congress provided that contracts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 444 U.

Similar provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80a-46(b), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78cc(b), and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 79z(b), have been recognized as reflecting an intent to create private rights of action to redress violations of substantive provisions of those Acts.  <em>Brown v. Bullock,</em> 194 F.Supp. 207, 22228 (SDNY), <em>aff\'d,</em> 294 F.2d 415 (CA2 1961); <em>Kardon v. National Gypsum Co.,</em> 69 F.Supp. 512, 514 (ED Pa.1946); <em>Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg.

Like the jurisdictional provisions of a statute, \xc2\xa7 215 "creates no cause of action of its own force and effect; it imposes no liabilities."  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

Section 215 merely specifies one consequence of a violation of the substantive prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 206.  The practical necessity of a private action to enforce this particular consequence of a \xc2\xa7 206 violation suggests that Congress contemplated the use of private actions to redress violations of \xc2\xa7 206.  It also indicates that Congress did not intend the powers given to the SEC to be the exclusive means for enforcement of the Act.

Section 214 provides that federal district courts "shall have jurisdiction of violations of [the Act] " and "of all suits in equity to enjoin any violation of" the Act.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-14.  Although other federal securities Acts have provisions expressly granting federal court jurisdiction over "actions at law," the significance of this omission is Delphic, at best.  While a previous draft of the bill that became the Act incorporated by reference the jurisdictional provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act, there is no indication in the legislative history as to why this draft was replaced with the language that became \xc2\xa7 214. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  The only reference to the jurisdictional provisions of the Act is the statement in the House Committee Report that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 208-221 "contain provisions comparable to those in [the Investment Company Act]."  H.R.Rep. No. 2639, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 30 (1940).  As the Second Circuit concluded in <em>Abrahamson v. Fleschner,</em> 568 F.2d at 875:</p>\n<p>"There is not a shred of evidence in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 444 U. S. 32</a></p><p> legislative history of the Advisers Act to support the assertion that Congress intentionally omitted the reference to \'actions at law\' in order to preclude private actions by investors."</p>\n<p><em>See Wilson v. First Houston Investment Corp.,</em> 566 F.2d at 1242.  The Court recognizes that the more plausible explanation for the failure of \xc2\xa7 214 expressly to include a reference to actions at law is that, unlike other federal securities Acts, the Act did not include other provisions expressly authorizing private civil actions for damages.  <em>See Abrahamson v. Fleschner, supra,</em> at 874; <em>Boler v. Laventhol, Krekstein, Horwath &amp; Horwath,</em> 381 F.Supp. 260, 264 265 (SDNY 1974).  But, as our cases indicate, this silence of the Act is not an automatic bar to private actions. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem with the Court\'s focus on \xc2\xa7 214 is that it attempts to discern congressional intent to deny a private cause of action from a jurisdictional, rather than a substantive, provision of the Act.  Because \xc2\xa7 214 is only a jurisdictional provision, "[i]t creates no cause of action of its own force and effect; it imposes no liabilities."  <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington,</em> 442 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html#577">442 U. S. 577</a></span>.  Since the source of implied rights of action must be found "in the substantive provisions of [the Act] which they seek to enforce, not in the jurisdictional provision," <em>ibid.,</em> \xc2\xa7 214\'s failure to refer to "actions at law" does not indicate that private actions for damages are unavailable under the Act.  The subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts over respondent\'s action is unquestioned, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="33">Page 444 U. S. 33</a></p><p> regardless of how \xc2\xa7 214 is interpreted, because jurisdiction is provided by the "arising under" clause of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331.  <em>Cf. Abrahamson v. Fleschner, supra</em> at 880, n. 5 (Gurfein, J., concurring and dissenting).  Where federal courts have jurisdiction over actions to redress violations of federal statutory rights, relief cannot be denied simply because Congress did not expressly provide for independent jurisdiction under the statute creating the federal rights.

S. 34</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The third portion of the <em>Cort</em> standard requires consideration of the compatibility of a private right of action with the legislative scheme. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  While a private remedy will not be implied to the frustration of the legislative purpose,</p>\n<p>"when that remedy is necessary or at least helpful to the accomplishment of the statutory purpose, the Court is decidedly receptive to its implication under the statute."</p>\n<p><em>Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#703">441 U. S. 703</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The purposes of the Act have been reviewed extensively by the Court in <em>SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/180/case.html">375 U. S. 180</a></span> (1963).  A meticulous review of the legislative history convinced the Court that the purpose of the Act was "to prevent fraudulent practices by investment advisers."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/180/case.html#195">375 U. S. 195</a></span>.  The Court concluded that</p>\n<p>"Congress intended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to be construed like other securities legislation \'enacted for the purpose of avoiding frauds,\' not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Implication of a private right of action for damages unquestionably would be not only consistent with the legislative goal of preventing fraudulent practices by investment advisers, but also essential to its achievement.  While the Act empowers the SEC to take action to seek equitable relief to prevent offending investment advisers from engaging in future violations, [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="35">Page 444 U. S. 35</a></p><p> in the absence of a private right of action for damages, victimized clients have little hope of obtaining redress for their injuries.  Like the statute in <em>Cannon,</em> the Act does not assure that the members of the class it benefits are able "to activate and participate in the administrative process contemplated by the statute."  <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#707">441 U. S. 707</a></span>, n. 41.  Moreover, the SEC candidly admits that, given the tremendous growth of the investment advisory industry, the magnitude of the enforcement problem exceeds the Commission\'s limited examination and enforcement capabilities. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The Commission maintains that private litigation therefore is a necessary supplement to SEC enforcement activity.  Under the circumstances of this case, this position seems unassailable.  <em>Cf. J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,</em> 377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/426/case.html#432">377 U. S. 432</a></span>; <em>Cannon v.

Regulation of the activities of investment advisers has not been a traditional state concern.  During the Senate hearings preceding enactment of the Act, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 444 U. S. 36</a></p><p> Congress was informed that only six States had enacted legislation to regulate investment advisers.  Hearings on S. 3580 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 996-1017 (1940).  Most of the state statutes subsequently enacted have been patterned after the federal legislation.  <em>See</em> Note, Private Causes of Action Under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act, 74 Mich.L.Rev. 308, 324 (1975).</p>\n<p>Although some practices proscribed by the Act undoubtedly would have been actionable in common law actions for fraud, "Congress intended the Investment Advisers Act to establish federal fiduciary standards for investment advisers."  <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v.

The Act was enacted for the special benefit of clients of investment advisers, and there is no indication of any legislative intent to deny such a cause of action, which would be consistent with the legislative scheme governing an area not traditionally relegated to state law.  Under these circumstances, an implied private right of action for damages should be recognized.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The provisions of \xc2\xa7 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-6, are substantially similar to \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \xc2\xa7 240.10b-5 (1979), both of which have been held to create private rights of action for which damages may be recovered.  <em>Superintendent of Insurance v.

Section 206 makes it unlawful for any investment adviser</p>\n<p>"(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client; (2) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client;"</p>\n<p>and (3) to engage in certain transactions with "a client" or "for the account of such client," without making certain written disclosures "to such client" and "obtaining the consent of the client to such transaction."  Statements in the House and Senate Committee Reports that accompanied the original legislation reinforce the conclusion that the Act was designed to protect investors against fraudulent practices by investment advisers.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> H.R.Rep. No. 2639, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 28 (1940); S.Rep. No. 1775, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 21 (1940).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Also, as the Court recognizes, the legislative history of the Act is "entirely silent" on the question of private rights of action; it neither explicitly nor implicitly indicates that Congress intended to deny private damages actions to clients victimized by their investment advisers.  Every court that has considered the question has come to this conclusion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that, because the Act expressly provides for SEC enforcement proceedings, Congress must not have intended to create private rights of action.  This application of the oft-criticized maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em> ignores our rejection of it in <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#82">422 U. S. 82</a></span>-83, n. 14, in the absence of specific support in the legislative history for the proposition that express statutory remedies are to be exclusive.  Moreover, the Court ignores the fact that the enforcement powers given the SEC under the Act are virtually identical to those embodied in other securities Acts under which implied rights of action have been recognized.  <em>Abrahamson v. Fleschner,</em> 568 F.2d 862, 874, n.19 (CA2 1977).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' suggestion that this change may have been the product of industry pressure is at odds with the legislative history.  Industry objections to the original draft of the legislation focused on matters unrelated to the jurisdictional provisions of the bill.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Hearings on H.R. 10065 before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 92 (1940).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Congressional failure to make express provision for private actions for damages is not surprising in light of Congress\' traditional reliance on the courts to determine whether private rights of action should be implied and to award appropriate relief.  <em>See Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#718">441 U. S. 718</a></span> (REHNQUIST, J., concurring).  Although recent decisions of the Court have contained admonitions for Congress to legislate with greater specificity in the future, <em>ibid.</em> (REHNQUIST, J., concurring) and <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#749">441 U. S. 749</a></span> (POWELL, J., dissenting); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/560/case.html">442 U.

S. 579</a></span> (1979), Congress cannot be faulted for failing to anticipate these admonitions when the Act was enacted in 1940.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>If Congress provided no indication of any intent to deny private rights of action when \xc2\xa7 214 was enacted, the subsequent failure of Congress to amend \xc2\xa7 214 likewise offers none. The 1960 amendments to the Act expanded the scope of \xc2\xa7 206 and strengthened the authority of the SEC.  74 Stat. 887. These amendments were not addressed to the "private right of action" question, nor is there any indication that Congress considered the question when the amendments were passed.  Moreover, as the Court has noted in reviewing the legislative history of the Act on a prior occasion:</p>\n<p>"[T]he intent of Congress must be culled from the events surrounding the passage of the 1940 legislation.  \'[O]pinions attributed to a Congress twenty years after the event cannot be considered evidence of the intent of the Congress of 1940.\'"</p>\n<p><em>SEC v.

S. 199</a></span>-200 (1963).</p>\n<p>This admonition applies with equal force with respect to the 1970 amendments to the Act.  Although the 1970 amendments were part of legislation that created a new private right of action under the Investment Company Act,</p>\n<p>"it would be odd to infer from Congress\' actions concerning the newly created provisions of [a companion Act] any intention regarding the enforcement of a long-existing statute."</p>\n<p><em>Cort v.

Moreover, the Committee Reports accompanying the 1970 amendments clearly indicated that the provision of express rights of action was not intended to affect the availability of implied rights of action elsewhere.  H.R.Rep. No. 91-1382, p. 38 (1970); S.Rep. No. 91-184, p. 16 (1969) .</p>\n<p>The failure of Congress during its 1976 and 1977 sessions to adopt an SEC proposal to add the words "actions at law" to \xc2\xa7 214 of the Act also does not foreclose private enforcement.  The proposal, which was favorably reported on by a Senate Committee, S.Rep. No. 94-910 (1976), was intended only to confirm the existence of an implied right of action, and not to create one.  575 F.2d 237, 238, n. 1 (CA9 1978).  The failure of Congress to enact legislation is not always a reliable guide to legislative intent, <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/case.html">395 U. S. 367</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/case.html#382">395 U.

It is a totally inadequate guide when, as here, Congress may have deemed the proposed legislation unnecessary, given the adequacy of existing legislation to support an implied right of action.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court ignores the third and fourth prongs of the <em>Cort</em> test on the ground that they were ignored in <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, supra.</em>  However, in <em>Touche Ross,</em> the Court found it unnecessary to consider these factors only because the other portions of the <em>Cort</em> standard could not be satisfied.  By contrast, the Court here concludes that at least the first part of the <em>Cort</em> test is satisfied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See, e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 209(e) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-9(e) (authorizing the SEC to seek injunctive relief against violations of the Act); \xc2\xa7 203(e), 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80b-3(e) (empowering the SEC to revoke the registration of investment advisers).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>As of December 31, 1978, a total of 5,385 investment advisers were registered with the SEC.  The Commission estimates that, for the fiscal year ending October 30, 1980, more than $200 billion in assets will be under advisement by registered investment advisers.  Brief for SEC as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 32-33.  In 1977, the SEC was able to conduct only 459 inspections of investment advisers.  43 SEC Ann.Rep. 234 (1977).  As the Court recognized in <em>Cannon,</em> in many cases, the enforcement agency may be unable to investigate meritorious private complaints, and even when the few investigations do uncover violations, the private victims of the violations need not be included in the relief.  441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html#706">441 U.
