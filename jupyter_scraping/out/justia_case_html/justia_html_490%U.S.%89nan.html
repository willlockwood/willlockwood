Benson</em> and <em>Wrenn v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health,</em> 489 U.S. 1095.  Since October Term, 1986, petitioner has filed 22 petitions for certiorari with the Court.  We denied him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> with respect to 19 of those petitions, and he paid the docketing fee required by this Court\'s Rule 45(a) on one occasion. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He also filed one petition for rehearing. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="90">Page 490 U. S. 90</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court\'s Rule 46.1 requires that</p>\n<p>"[a] party desiring to proceed in this Court <em>in forma pauperis</em> shall file a motion for leave to so proceed, together with his affidavit in the form prescribed in Fed.Rules App.Proc., Form 4 . . . setting forth with particularity facts showing that he comes within the statutory requirements."</p>\n<p>Our decision to deny a petitioner leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> is based on our review of the information contained in the supporting affidavit of indigency. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In petitioner\'s case, a review of the affidavits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 490 U. S. 91</a></p><p> he has filed with his last nine petitions for certiorari indicates that his financial condition has remained substantially unchanged. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court denied him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> with respect to each petition.  Petitioner has nonetheless continued to file for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 490 U.

S. 184</a></span> (1989), we said that</p>\n<p>"[e]very paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution\'s limited resources.  A part of the Court\'s responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice."</p>\n<p>We do not think that justice is served if the Court continues to process petitioner\'s requests to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> when his financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a previous filing in which he was denied leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p>We direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further filings from petitioner in which he seeks leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> under this Court\'s Rule 46, unless the affidavit submitted with the filing indicates that petitioner\'s financial condition has substantially changed from that reflected in the affidavits submitted by him in <em>Wrenn v.
