The district court gave no opinion and, aside from the general recital in the decree that the court had considered the evidence submitted by the parties and that it appeared therefrom that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 281 U. S. 83</a></p><p> valuation fixed by the Railroad Commission of the property of the company for ratemaking purposes was not supported, the record contains no finding whatever by the district court.</p>\n<p>This Court has repeatedly adverted to the importance in a suit of this character of a statement by the district court of the grounds of its decision.  <em>Virginian Railway Co. v.
