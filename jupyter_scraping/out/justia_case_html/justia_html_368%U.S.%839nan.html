Patterson, 142 Colo. 180, 350 P.2d 571, 575, and to make new findings that petitioner was then indigent? See Brown v. Allen, <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html">344 U.S. 443</a>, at pages 458, 463-464, 506, 437, at pages 407, 410-411, 445; (2) Does the decision of this Court in Eskridge v. Washington State Board, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/214/case.html">357 U.S. 214</a>, require or justify retrospective application of the rule of Griffin v.
