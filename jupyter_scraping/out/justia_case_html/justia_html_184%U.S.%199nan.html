Northern Securities Co., 184 U.S.  199 (1902)</h3><p><b>Minnesota v. Northern Securities Company</b></p><p><b>No. 10, Original</b></p><p><b>Argued January 27, 1902</b></p><p><b>Decided February 24, 1902</b></p><p><b>184 U.S. 199</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Whether a bill in equity, filed in the name of a state, seeking to prevent by injunction a corporation organized under the laws of another state, with power to acquire and hold shares of the capital stock of any other corporation, from obtaining and exercising ownership and control of two or more competing railroad companies of the state so as to evade and defeat its laws and policy forbidding the consolidation of such railroads when parallel and competing, is a controversy of which this Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The general rule in equity is that all persons materially interested, either legally or beneficially, in the subject matter of a suit are to be made parties to it, and the established practice of courts of equity to dismiss the plaintiffs\' bill if it appears that to grant the relief prayed for would injuriously affect persons materially interested in the subject matter who are not made parties to the suit, is founded upon clear reasons, and may be enforced by the court <em>sua sponte,</em> though not raised by the pleadings, or suggested by counsel.</p>\n<p>The bill discloses that the parties to be affected by the decision of this controversy are -- directly, the Minnesota, the Great Northern Railway Company, and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, corporations of that state, and the Northern Securities Company, a corporation of the New Jersey -- and, indirectly, the stockholders and bondholders of those corporations, and of the numerous railway companies whose lines are alleged to be owned, managed or controlled by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies, and it is obvious that the rights of the minority stockholders of the two railroad companies are not represented by the Northern Securities Company.</p>\n<p>When it appears to a court of equity that a case otherwise presenting ground for its action cannot be dealt with because of the absence of essential parties, and it further appears that necessary and indispensable parties are beyond the reach of the jurisdiction of the court, or that, as in this case, when made parties, the jurisdiction of the court will thereby be defeated, it would be useless for the court to grant leave to amend.</p>\n<p>On the 7th day of January, 1902, came the State of Minnesota, by Wallace B. Douglas, its Attorney General, and moved the Court for leave to file a bill of complaint against the Northern Securities Company, a corporation of the State of New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 184 U. S. 200</a></p><p> Jersey.  Thereupon the Court directed that notice of such application should be given to the defendant, and set the motion for argument on January 27, 1902, when it was duly heard.</p>\n<p>The bill proposed to be filed was in the following terms:</p>\n<p>"<em>To the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America:</em>"</p>\n<p>"Your oratrix, the Minnesota, complainant, by Wallace B. Douglas, Attorney General thereof, brings this its bill of complaint against the Northern Securities Company, a corporation organized under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New Jersey, and alleges:"</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>I</h3>"<p></p>\n<p>"That, by an Act of Congress entitled \'An Act for the Admission of Minnesota into the Union,\' approved May 11, A.D. 1858, the said State of Minnesota was admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original states."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>II</h3>"<p></p>\n<p>That said Northern Securities Company is a corporation organized as hereinafter alleged, under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New Jersey, and is a citizen of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>III</h3>"<p></p>\n<p>"A."</p>\n<p>That by an Act of the Congress of the United States, of March 12, 1860, extending to the State of Minnesota the swamp lands grant theretofore made to the State of Arkansas, and by various subsequent acts, the Congress of the United States donated to the State of Minnesota from the public domain large quantities of lands situated within the State of Minnesota, and of the value of several millions of dollars.  That the State of Minnesota now has left and undisposed of more than 3,000,000 acres of said lands, of the value of more than $15,000,000, much of which said land is located in the territory traversed by the railroads of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, as hereinafter alleged.  That the value of said land, and the salability thereof, depends </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 184 U. S. 201</a></p><p> in very large measure upon having free, uninterrupted, and open competition in passenger and freight rates over the lines of railway owned and operated by said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway Companies.</p>\n<p>"That many of said lands are vacant and unsettled and located in regions not at present reached by railway lines, and depend for settlement upon the construction of lines in the future; that it has heretofore been the practice of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, respectively, to extend spur lines into territory adjacent to each of said roads as well as into new territory for the purpose of developing such territory, as well as to obtain traffic therefrom; that such new lines have been built in the past very largely by reason of the rivalry heretofore existing between said companies, for existing as well as new business; that, under the consolidation and unity of control hereinafter set forth, such rivalry will cease, and many of the lands now owned by the State of Minnesota will not be reached by railroads for years to come, if at all, owing to such combination and consolidation removing all rivalry and competition between said companies; that the settlement and occupation of said lands will add very much to their value, and such occupation will depend entirely upon the accessibility of railway lines and transportation facilities for marketing the products raised thereon; that, if said lands are sold and become occupied, they will add very largely to the taxable value of the property of the state, and that said lands cannot be sold or the income of the state increased thereby without the construction of railroad lines to, or adjacent to, the same."</p>\n<p>"<em>B." </em></p>\n<p>"That the State of Minnesota is now and for many years past has been the owner of and continuously maintained an educational institution for the benefit of its citizens known as the University of Minnesota, also a large number of hospitals for the insane, within its territorial limits; also five normal schools for the education of teachers within the state; also a state training school for boys and girls; also several state schools for the education, care, and maintenance of the deaf, dumb, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 184 U. S. 202</a></p><p> blind, and feebleminded; also a state school for indigent and homeless children; also a state penitentiary and reformatory."</p>\n<p>"That for many years past, the State of Minnesota has continuously maintained and supported each of said institutions, and in the care, maintenance, and management thereof has been compelled to and in the future, of necessity, will annually purchase large quantities of supplies for said institutions, including provisions, clothing, and fuel, a great portion of which the State of Minnesota is compelled to ship over the different lines of railway owned and operated by the Northern Pacific Railway Company and the Great Northern Railway Company."</p>\n<p>"That the State of Minnesota is compelled to expend annually more than $700,000 in the operation and maintenance of said public institutions, most of which sum is raised by general taxation upon the lands and other property of the citizens of the State of Minnesota and situated therein.  That the amount of taxes which said State of Minnesota can collect, and the successful maintenance of its said public institutions, as well as the performance of its governmental functions and affairs, depend largely upon the value of the real and personal property situated within its territorial limits and the general prosperity and business success of its citizens.  That the value of said real and personal property of the citizens of the State of Minnesota, as well as their business success and general prosperity, depend very largely upon maintaining in said state free, open, and unrestricted competition between the railway lines of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, respectively, within said state."</p>\n<p>"<em>C." </em></p>\n<p>"That it has been the settled policy and practice of the State of Minnesota, since its organization as a territory, to develop the resources of the state by encouraging railroad building therein, and in furtherance of this policy, the Territory of Minnesota, by an act thereof under the date of May 22, 1857, granted to the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company a charter, and in consideration of the construction and maintenance of a line of railway in Minnesota by said company said territory donated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 184 U. S. 203</a></p><p> to it out of its public domain about 700,000 acres of land.  That said Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company thereafter became insolvent, and all its property was placed in the hands of a receiver; that such proceedings were thereafter had that all the property of the last-named company, including said land, was duly sold and conveyed to the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway Company, hereinafter mentioned."</p>\n<p>"That the State of Minnesota, by an act of its legislature and in consideration of the construction and maintenance of a line of railway by the Great Northern Railway Company, hereinafter referred to, between St. Cloud and Hinckley, a distance of eighty-four miles, donated and conveyed to said last-named company upwards of four hundred thousand acres of land then owned by and situated in the State of Minnesota, which said land was then worth more than one million dollars.  That, in carrying out said policy and in aid of the building of railways within the State of Minnesota, there has been granted out of the public domain within the limits of the State of Minnesota upwards of ten million five hundred thousand acres of land, nearly all of which has been granted to said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies and the subsidiary companies owned and controlled by them."</p>\n<p>"<em>D." </em></p>\n<p>"That, by an Act of the Legislature of the State of Minnesota approved March 3, 1881, entitled \'An Act Granting Swamp Lands to Aid in the Construction of the Main Line of the Road of the Little Falls &amp; Dakota Railway Company,\' and which now is a part of the Northern Pacific Railway Company system, hereinafter referred to, the State of Minnesota donated to said Little Falls and Dakota Railway Company two hundred forty-three thousand five hundred and ninety-one (243,591) acres of land situated in and then belonging to said state, in consideration of the construction and maintenance by said last-named railway company of a line of railway extending from Little Falls to Morris, in the State of Minnesota."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>IV</h3>."<p></p>\n<p>"Your oratrix further alleges that immense quantities of wheat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 184 U.

That nearly all of the shipment of such products made from the above-named initial points are consigned to various citizens at either the City of Duluth, St. Paul, or Minneapolis over one or the other of said lines of railroad last-above named.  That enormous quantities of merchandise have been and will continue to be shipped annually over said lines of railway, between the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis and various other cities and villages along said lines of railway situated within the State of Minnesota, and which are purchased and used entirely by the people of said state.  That the competition in both freight and passenger traffic to and from said places has always been sharp and active between said railway companies, and has secured to the residents of said cities, as well as the State of Minnesota, and to the State of Minnesota itself, much lower rates for both freight and passengers than would otherwise have been obtained, or than will or can be obtained in case the consolidation or unity of control and management of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, hereinafter alleged, is not enjoined as herein prayed."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>V</h3>."<p></p>\n<p>"That the Great Northern Railway Company is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Minnesota, to-wit, under an act duly passed by the Territory of Minnesota, entitled \'An Act to Incorporate the Minneapolis &amp; St. Cloud Railroad Company,\' approved March 1st, A.D. 1856, and various subsequent acts of the State of Minnesota, amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, respectively entitled as follows:"</p>\n<p>"   An Act to Amend an Act Entitled \'An Act to Incorporate the Minneapolis &amp; St. Cloud Railroad Company,\' Passed March 1, 1856."</p>\n<p>"Approved February 23, 1864.

That the State of Minnesota now has left and undisposed of more than 3,000,000 acres of said lands, of the value of more than $15,000,000, much of which said land is located in the territory traversed by the railroads of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, as hereinafter alleged.  That the value of said land, and the salability thereof, depends </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 184 U.

That the amount of taxes which said State of Minnesota can collect, and the successful maintenance of its said public institutions, as well as the performance of its governmental functions and affairs, depend largely upon the value of the real and personal property situated within its territorial limits and the general prosperity and business success of its citizens.  That the value of said real and personal property of the citizens of the State of Minnesota, as well as their business success and general prosperity, depend very largely upon maintaining in said state free, open, and unrestricted competition between the railway lines of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, respectively, within said state."</p>\n<p>"<em>C." </em></p>\n<p>"That it has been the settled policy and practice of the State of Minnesota, since its organization as a territory, to develop the resources of the state by encouraging railroad building therein, and in furtherance of this policy, the Territory of Minnesota, by an act thereof under the date of May 22, 1857, granted to the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company a charter, and in consideration of the construction and maintenance of a line of railway in Minnesota by said company said territory donated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 184 U.

That, in carrying out said policy and in aid of the building of railways within the State of Minnesota, there has been granted out of the public domain within the limits of the State of Minnesota upwards of ten million five hundred thousand acres of land, nearly all of which has been granted to said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies and the subsidiary companies owned and controlled by them."</p>\n<p>"<em>D." </em></p>\n<p>"That, by an Act of the Legislature of the State of Minnesota approved March 3, 1881, entitled \'An Act Granting Swamp Lands to Aid in the Construction of the Main Line of the Road of the Little Falls &amp; Dakota Railway Company,\' and which now is a part of the Northern Pacific Railway Company system, hereinafter referred to, the State of Minnesota donated to said Little Falls and Dakota Railway Company two hundred forty-three thousand five hundred and ninety-one (243,591) acres of land situated in and then belonging to said state, in consideration of the construction and maintenance by said last-named railway company of a line of railway extending from Little Falls to Morris, in the State of Minnesota."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>IV</h3>."<p></p>\n<p>"Your oratrix further alleges that immense quantities of wheat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 184 U.

That enormous quantities of merchandise have been and will continue to be shipped annually over said lines of railway, between the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis and various other cities and villages along said lines of railway situated within the State of Minnesota, and which are purchased and used entirely by the people of said state.  That the competition in both freight and passenger traffic to and from said places has always been sharp and active between said railway companies, and has secured to the residents of said cities, as well as the State of Minnesota, and to the State of Minnesota itself, much lower rates for both freight and passengers than would otherwise have been obtained, or than will or can be obtained in case the consolidation or unity of control and management of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, hereinafter alleged, is not enjoined as herein prayed."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>V</h3>."<p></p>\n<p>"That the Great Northern Railway Company is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Minnesota, to-wit, under an act duly passed by the Territory of Minnesota, entitled \'An Act to Incorporate the Minneapolis &amp; St. Cloud Railroad Company,\' approved March 1st, A.D. 1856, and various subsequent acts of the State of Minnesota, amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, respectively entitled as follows:"</p>\n<p>"   An Act to Amend an Act Entitled \'An Act to Incorporate the Minneapolis &amp; St. Cloud Railroad Company,\' Passed March 1, 1856."</p>\n<p>"Approved February 23, 1864.

The funds for retiring said preferred stock to be raised by the issuance by said Northern Pacific Railway Company of its negotiable bonds, bearing date November 15, 1901, of the aggregate amount of seventy-five million dollars, payable January 1, 1907, in gold coin of the United States, with interest thereon at the rate of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="223">Page 184 U. S. 223</a></p><p> four percent per annum, payable semiannually in like gold coin, from and after January 1, 1902, the said bonds, however, to be convertible at the option of either the holders thereof, or said railway company, into shares of the common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company at the rate of one share of stock for each one hundred dollars of the principal sum of such bonds, and the said common stock, when so taken in exchange for such bonds, to be converted into stock of said Northern Securities Company upon the basis of one share for each one and 15-100 shares of stock of said Northern Securities Company."</p>\n<p>"That said preferred stock could only be retired by resolution of the Board of Directors of said Northern Pacific Railway Company; that a very large majority of said preferred stock was owned by certain individuals who were opposed to the agreement and plan herein referred to relative to turning over the management and control of said Northern Pacific Railway Company to said Northern Securities Company and the holding of its stock by said Northern Securities Company; that the owners of said preferred stock so opposed to said agreement and plan were also owners of sufficient of the common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company to give them a small majority of the total capital stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, thus making it necessary, in order to carry out the plan and agreement herein set forth and to vest the management and control of said Northern Pacific Railway Company in said Northern Securities Company in the manner and for the purposes herein alleged, to retire said preferred stock, all of which was well known to the Board of Directors of said Northern Pacific Railway Company and to said J.

S. 224</a></p><p> in the manner herein alleged.  That, immediately after the retirement of said preferred stock, said Northern Pacific Railway Company, acting through its board of directors and executive officers, exercised its right and option of declaring said bonds to be convertible into the shares of the common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, and thereupon the same were so converted and the common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company issued in exchange therefor, upon the basis and for the purposes herein alleged.  That, in order to prevent the persons who owned said preferred stock and who were opposed to the carrying out of the plan and agreement herein referred to from acquiring a like control of the common stock, it was provided that the $75,000,000 of common stock into which the said bonds were convertible could only be subscribed for and taken by holders of the then outstanding $80,000,000 of the common capital stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, each share of said common stock then outstanding entitling the owner and holder thereof to take an additional seventy-five eightieths of a share of said $75,000,000 additional common stock.  That the retirement of said preferred stock and the conversion of the said bonds into common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, and the exchange of said common stock for stock of said Northern Securities Company, as herein alleged, were each and all a part of the agreement, plan, and scheme of said J. Pierpont Morgan and his said associate stockholders of said Northern Pacific Railway Company who then and there owned and controlled a large majority of the then outstanding common stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, under and by which the complete management and control of said Northern Pacific Railway Company was to be, and was thereafter, turned over to and vested in said Northern Securities Company in order that said Northern Pacific Railway Company, its property and franchises, might be in effect consolidated with the property and franchises of said Great Northern Railway Company, as herein alleged.

And that the said Northern Securities Company is about to receive, on the basis aforesaid, and will, unless enjoined therefrom, receive, hold, and hereafter control all the capital stock of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies."</p>\n<p>"</p><h3>X</h3>"<p></p>\n<p>"That the organization of said Northern Securities Company in the manner hereinbefore alleged, and the making of said agreement or arrangement hereinbefore referred to, are each and all a part of a scheme or plan on the part of said James J.

Pierpont Morgan and his said associate holders of the stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, under and by which the said two last-named railway companies are to be in effect consolidated, and the complete management and control of the business affairs of said corporations respectively placed in one body and under the direction and control of one man or one board of directors, through and by means of said defendant.  That, pursuant to said plan, agreement, and arrangement and in consummation thereof, and for the purpose of placing the complete management and control of said Great Northern Railway Company and said Northern Pacific Railway Company under one management, and for the purpose of establishing, in effect, a consolidation of said railway companies, together with said railway lines and properties, in and through said defendant, the said J. Pierpont Morgan </p><p><a class="page-number" name="227">Page 184 U.

Hill and his associate stockholders of said Great Northern Railway Company have also actually assigned and delivered to said Northern Securities Company upwards of eighty-five percent of the said capital stock of said Great Northern Railway Company.  That the sole purpose, object, and effect of the transfer of said stock by said James J. Hill and his said associates, and the said J. Pierpont Morgan and his said associates, to said Northern Securities Company was and is to transfer to and vest in said defendant Northern Securities Company the complete management and control of the respective lines of railway and railway properties of each of said railway companies within and without the State of Minnesota, and to place the complete management and control of the same, and the power to dictate the policy of each of said corporations, as well as the power and authority to fix rates and charges for the transportation of both freight and passengers within the State of Minnesota, as well as without said state, in the hands of and under the control of one party or board of directors, and thereby create, foster, and perpetuate a monopoly in railway traffic in the State of Minnesota."</p>\n<p>"That the purpose, object, and effect of the incorporation of the defendant and the receipt by it of a controlling amount of the capital stock of the said Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway companies, as well as each act of the officers and board of directors thereof in entering into, adopting, or executing the agreement or plan herein set forth, including the issuance and exchange of the capital stock of the Northern Securities Company for the stock of the said Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railway companies on the basis hereinbefore set forth, was, and is, to place the said railway companies and the property and franchises thereof under a single management, and enable a single party or body of men acting as the Board of Directors of the said Northern Securities Company, or such executive committee as they may designate, to fix all rates and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="228">Page 184 U.

S. 235</a></p><p> United States, and whether the bill in the present case is of that description, or whether it is the case of a suit brought by a state to enforce its penal statutes, and hence within the principle of the decision in <em>Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/127/265/case.html">127 U. S. 265</a></span>, are questions which have been ably discussed by counsel.</p>\n<p>But it is not necessary for us to consider and answer those questions, for, in view of the nature of the facts presented and the remedies prayed for in the bill proposed to be filed, we think that the suit is defective for want of essential parties whose rights would be vitally affected by the relief sought therein.</p>\n<p>The general rule in equity is that all persons materially interested, either legally or beneficially, in the subject matter of a suit are to be made parties to it, so that there may be a complete decree which shall bind them all.  By this means, the Court is enabled to make a complete decree between the parties, to prevent future litigation by taking away the necessity of a multiplicity of suits, and to make it perfectly certain that no injustice is done either to the parties before it or to others who are interested in the subject matter, by a decree which might otherwise be granted upon a partial view only of the real merits.  When all the parties are before the court, the whole case may be seen; but it may not where all the conflicting interests are not brought out upon the pleadings by the original parties thereto.

S. 236</a></p><p> They are:  1. Formal parties.  2. Persons having an interest in the controversy, and who ought to be made parties, in order that the court may act on that rule which requires it to decide on and finally determine the entire controversy, and do complete justice, by adjusting all the rights involved in it.  These persons are commonly termed necessary parties; but if their interests are separable from those of the parties before the court, so that the court can proceed to a decree and do complete and final justice without affecting other persons not before the court, the latter are not indispensable parties.  3. Persons who not only have an interest in the controversy, but an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.  The Court, in respect to the Act of Congress of February 28, 1839, 5 Stat. 321, and to the forty-seventh rule in equity practice, said (p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/58/130/case.html#140">58 U.

It does not affect any case where persons having an interest are not joined because their citizenship is such that their joinder would defeat the jurisdiction, and, so far as it touches suits in equity, we understand it to be no more than a legislative affirmance of the rule previously established by the cases of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/16/591/case.html">Cameron v.

For this Court had already there decided that the nonjoinder of a party who could not be served with process would not defeat the jurisdiction.

Hinde,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 198, when speaking of a case where an indispensable party was not before the court,"</p>\n<p>"we do not put this case upon the ground of jurisdiction, but upon a much broader ground, which must equally apply to all courts of equity, whatever may be their structure as to jurisdiction; we put it on the ground that no court can adjudicate directly upon a person\'s right without the party\'s being either actually or constructively before the court."</p>\n<p>"So that, while this act removed any difficulty as to jurisdiction between competent parties regularly served with process, it does not attempt to displace that principle of jurisprudence on which the Court rested the case last mentioned.  And the forty-seventh rule is only a declaration, for the government of practitioners and courts, of the effect of this act of Congress and of the previous decisions of the Court on the subject of that rule.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/55/29/case.html#36">Hogan v. Walker,</a></span></em> 14 How. 36."</p>\n<p>"It remains true, notwithstanding the act of Congress and the forty-seventh rule, that a circuit court can make no decree affecting the rights of an absent person, and can make no decree between the parties before it, which so far involves or depends upon the rights of an absent person that complete and final justice cannot be done between the parties to the suit without affecting those rights."</p>\n<p><em>California v. Southern Pacific Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/157/229/case.html">157 U. S. 229</a></span>, was a case in several particulars like the present one.  There, a bill was filed in this Court by the State of California against the Southern Pacific Company, a corporation of the State of Kentucky, claiming title and jurisdiction by the state over certain large tracts of land lying upon the shores of the Bay of San Francisco and over the harbor waters of said bay, including San Antonio Creek, and averring that the Southern Pacific Company claimed adversely to the state, and was engaged in placing structures in and upon said tracts of land, thereby obstructing navigation in the bay and adjoining waters.  The bill prayed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 184 U. S. 238</a></p><p> for a decree quieting the title of the state and enjoining the defendant company from maintaining the structures that it had placed upon said tracts and the adjacent waters.  The defendant company answered the bill, denying the ownership of the complainant in the premises in dispute and setting forth its own title derived from the Town of Oakland as to the whole of the water front of that town through one Carpentier, as grantee of said town by ordinance and deed of conveyance, and claiming that by subsequent mesne conveyances the said title and property had become vested, as to a part thereof, in the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and as to another part in the South Pacific Coast Railway Company and in the defendant company as lessee.  It further was claimed that certain ordinances and deeds of the Town of Oakland operated as a grant by the City of Oakland and the State of California of the land to the Oakland Water Front Company, as grantee or alienee of Carpentier.  The case was duly put at issue, and a commissioner was appointed to take testimony therein and to return the same to the court.</p>\n<p>When the case came on for hearing, it was held by this Court that the City of Oakland and the Oakland Water Front Company were so situated in respect to the litigation that the Court ought not to proceed in their absence.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court reviewed the cases, including the cases above cited and others.</p>\n<p>Upon the contention that the City of Oakland and the Oakland Water Front Company might be made parties defendant and the Court thus enabled to proceed with the case, the Court held that this could not be done, because this Court could not exercise original jurisdiction in a suit between a state, on the one hand, and a citizen of another state and citizens of the complainant state, on the other.  Accordingly, the bill was dismissed for want of parties who should be joined, but could not be without ousting our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>We shall therefore proceed to examine the substance of the bill proposed to be filed in order to see whether it discloses a case in which a decree could be granted which would do final and complete justice between the nominal parties without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 184 U. S. 239</a></p><p> vitally affecting other persons not before the Court.  As already stated, a conclusion reached that the suit cannot be entertained for want of necessary and essential parties will not imply any expression of opinion beyond that question.</p>\n<p>As the bill is set forth in full in the preceding statement, it will not be necessary to here repeat its allegations.  They may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p>The complainant is the State of Minnesota; the defendant is the Northern Securities Company, a corporation of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>It is part of the policy of the State of Minnesota as declared in its public statutes to prohibit therein the consolidation in any manner of competing and parallel lines of railway.  The statutes specially recited in the bill are the Act of March 9, 1874, the first section whereof is in the following terms:</p>\n<p>"No railroad corporation, or the lessees, purchaser, or managers of any railroad company shall consolidate the stock, property, or franchise of such corporation with, or lease or purchase the works or franchise of, or in any way control, any other railroad corporation owning or having under its control a parallel or competing line, nor shall any officer of such railroad corporation act as an officer of any other railroad corporation owning or having the control of a parallel or competing line, and the question whether railroads are parallel or competing lines shall, when demanded by the party complainant, be decided by a jury as in other civil issues,"</p>\n<p>and the Act of March 3, 1881, of which the third section is as follows:</p>\n<p>"No railroad company shall consolidate with, lease, or purchase, or in any way become the owner of or control, any other railroad corporation or stock, franchises, rights or property thereof, which owns or controls a parallel or competing line."</p>\n<p>The Great Northern Railway Company is a corporation organized and existing under an act duly passed by the Territory of Minnesota and under various subsequent acts of the State of Minnesota, and owns and controls, as lessee, several important lines of railroad, some only within and others extending beyond the State of Minnesota, and which are maintained by the Great Northern Railway Company as one complete system.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 184 U. S. 240</a></p><p> Board of Directors of the Great Northern Railway Company at the time of the organization of the Northern Securities Company, to-wit, on or about November 13, 1901, was and now is composed of the following-named persons, to-wit:  James J. Hill, James N. Hill, Samuel Hill, William P. Clough, Edward Sawyer, Jacob H. Schiff, and Henry W. Cannon.  That on said last-mentioned date, the Great Northern Railway Company had issued and there was then outstanding a total of one hundred and twenty-five million dollars par value of the capital stock of said corporation, of which it is alleged that said James J. Hill was on said last-mentioned date the owner of or had subject to his direction and disposition more than a majority of said capital stock so outstanding.</p>\n<p>The Northern Pacific Railway Company was organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin of the year 1895, and afterwards, by filing a certified copy of its articles of incorporation, became a corporation of the State of Minnesota and subject to the laws of that state relating to railroad corporations.  In the year 1896, the Northern Pacific Railway Company duly purchased and became the owner of the entire railroad properties and lines formerly owned by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and at all times since has continuously owned and operated each and all of said lines of railway situated within the State of Minnesota, and which connect the Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Duluth, and connect with the lines of railways outside the State of Minnesota.  During the year 1899, the said Northern Pacific Railway Company purchased, and ever since has owned and operated, a line of railway extending from the Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis to Duluth, Minnesota.  Said last-mentioned line parallels and is a competing line of railway for both freight and passenger traffic with the line of railway between said Minneapolis and St. Paul and Duluth owned by the Eastern Railway Company of Minnesota, but which is operated, controlled, and managed by said Great Northern Railway Company as a part of the system of that company.  The lines of railway now owned and operated by said Great Northern Railway Company within the State of Minnesota are parallel and competing lines for freight and passenger traffic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 184 U. S. 241</a></p><p> with the lines of railway now owned, operated, and controlled by said Northern Pacific Railway Company within the State of Minnesota, and also said lines of railway owned, operated, and controlled by said Great Northern Railway Company, and also the lines of railway owned, operated, and controlled by said Northern Pacific Railway Company which connect with the lines of railway owned, operated, and controlled by each of said companies respectively within the State of Minnesota, are parallel and competing lines through the States of North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington to Puget Sound on the Pacific Coast, for passenger and freight traffic.  That said companies are the only railway companies owning or operating lines of railway crossing the State of Minnesota and connecting the Pacific Ocean by rail with points in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>That the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company, a corporation of the State of Illinois, has for many years last past owned, operated, and controlled an extensive system of railway lines connecting the City of Chicago with the City of Denver, in the State of Colorado, and with the City of Billings, in the State of Montana, which last-named point is a junction and competitive point for freight and passenger traffic with said Northern Pacific Railway Company, etc.  That, during the year 1901, the said Great Northern Railway Company and said Northern Pacific Railway Company jointly purchased ninety-eight percent of the total capital stock of said Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company, aggregating approximately one hundred and seven millions of dollars par value, and now own the same, and issued in payment therefor the joint bonds of said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, payable in twenty years from the date thereof, and bearing interest at the rate of four percent per annum, payable semiannually.  That the said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies issued and delivered in exchange for each one hundred dollars in amount of said Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company stock two hundred dollars in amount of the said bonds, and that, under and by virtue of the purchase of the said stock, the joint ownership and control of the said Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway Company are vested in, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 184 U. S. 242</a></p><p> and ever since have been exercised by, the said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies.  During April, 1901, and ever since, the following-named persons constituted and now are the members of the Board of Directors of the Northern Pacific Railway Company:  James J. Hill, Robert Bacon, George F. Baker, E. H. Harriman, H. McK, Twombly, Brayton Ives, D. Willis James, John S. Kennedy, Daniel S. Lamont, Charles S. Mellen, Samuel Rea, William Rockefeller, Charles Steele, James Stillman, and Eben B. Thomas.  On November 13, 1901, J. Pierpont Morgan, with certain other unknown persons, but who were acting with said Morgan, owned and had in their possession, or held and had subject to their control and disposition, upwards of eighty-five percent of the total capital stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company.  The Northern Securities Company was organized on November 13, 1901, with its principal office at Hoboken, in the State of New Jersey, and the objects for which the corporation was formed, as stated in the articles of incorporation, are to acquire and hold, as investments, the bonds, securities, and capital stock of any other corporation or corporations of the State of New Jersey, or of any other state, territory, or country, and while owner of said stock to exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges of ownership, including the right to vote thereon, and it is declared that the corporation shall have power to conduct its business in other states and in foreign countries, to have one or more offices out of the state, and to purchase, hold, and convey real and personal property out of the state.</p>\n<p>It is alleged that the Northern Securities Company was incorporated at the instigation and request of James J. Hill, William P. Clough, and certain unknown stockholders of said Great Northern Railway Company, who, with said Hill and Clough, owned or controlled, or have the disposition and management of, a large majority of the capital stock of said Great Northern Railway Company, and with the cooperation of J. Pierpont Morgan and certain other unknown stockholders of said Northern Pacific Railway Company, who, with said Morgan, owned and controlled, or have the disposition and management </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 184 U. S. 243</a></p><p> of, a large majority of the capital stock of said Northern Pacific Railway Company.</p>\n<p>On November 14, 1901, James J. Hill, George F. Baker, Daniel S. Lamont, James Stillman, N. Terhune, Samuel Thorne, Charles L. Perkins, Jacob H. Schiff, William P. Clough, John S. Kennedy, Willis James, E. T. Nichols, Robert Bacon, and E. H. Harriman were elected directors of the Northern Securities Company, and said directors on November 15, 1901, elected James J. Hill to be President, and John S. Kennedy, George F. Baker, Willis James, and William P. Clough to be Vice-Presidents, and E. T. Nichols to be Secretary and Treasurer, of said company.  It is alleged that the holders of a large majority of the capital stock of both said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies had knowledge of and assisted in the formation of the said Northern Securities Company, and that such stockholders, so consenting and assisting, constitute all of the stockholders of said Northern Securities Company.</p>\n<p>The bill charges that the purpose of the formation of the Northern Securities Company was to place the management and control of the Great Northern Railway Company and of the Northern Pacific Railway Company under one management, and to thus, in effect, establish a consolidation of said railway companies and defeat and evade the statutes and policy of the State of Minnesota forbidding consolidation of parallel and competing lines of railway.</p>\n<p>The relief prayed by the bill is that the defendant company be perpetually enjoined and restrained from voting at any meeting of either said Great Northern or Northern Pacific Railway Company, any of the capital stock of either of said companies by any means or in any manner whatsoever, and from attending, by reason of such ownership, possession, or control of stock, either through its officers or by proxy, or in any other manner, any meeting of the stockholders of either of said companies, and from, in any way aiding, advising, directing, interfering with or in any way taking part, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, in the management, control, or operation of any of the lines of railway of either of said companies, and that said defendant, its officers, attorneys, representatives, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 184 U. S. 244</a></p><p> agents, or servants, including its board of directors, or any of its members as such, be enjoined and restrained from exercising any of the powers or performing any of the duties, or in any manner acting as a representative, officer, member of the board of directors or employee, of either said Great Northern or Northern Pacific Railway Company, or in any way exercising any management, direction, or control over the same, and that said defendant, its stockholders, directors, and other officers, representatives, and agents, be enjoined and restrained from doing any and all acts and making any arrangements or combinations, by contract or otherwise, having for their object, effect, or result the consolidation or establishment of a joint management or control in any manner whatsoever of the said Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, their lines of railway or properties, and that said defendant be enjoined from either directly or indirectly holding, owning or controlling any of the stock of either of said companies at one and the same time for any of the purposes or objects alleged in the bill, or otherwise, and that in case it shall appear upon the hearing that the defendant owns or controls, or is acting in concert with the owners of, a majority of the capital stock of either of said railway companies, and owns or controls a minority of the stock of the other of said companies, then that the defendant, its officers, directors, agents, or representatives, be enjoined and restrained from receiving, acquiring, or controlling any additional capital stock of such other railway company, and further for leave to amend the bill of complaint, if amendment thereto shall become necessary, including the right to bring in other parties defendant for the purpose of giving force and effect to any decree that may be made by the court herein.</p>\n<p>More briefly stated, the case presented by the charges and prayers of the bill is that the State of Minnesota is apprehensive that a majority of the stockholders respectively of the Great Northern Railway Company and of the Northern Pacific Railway Company have combined and made an arrangement, through the organization of a corporation of the State of New Jersey, whereby such a consolidation, or, what is alleged to amount to the same thing, a joint control and management </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 184 U. S. 245</a></p><p> of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies, shall be effected as will operate to defeat and overrule the policy of the state in prohibiting the consolidation of parallel and competing lines of railway, and therefore appeals to a court of equity to prevent by injunction the operation and effect of such a combination and arrangement.</p>\n<p>But at once, as we have seen, the Court is put upon inquiry whether the parties and persons to be affected by such an injunction are before it.</p>\n<p>The narrative of the bill unquestionably discloses that the parties to be affected by a decision of the controversy are, directly, the State of Minnesota, the Great Northern Railway Company, the Northern Pacific Railway Company, corporations of that state, and the Northern Securities Company, a corporation of the State of New Jersey, and, indirectly, the stockholders and bondholders of those corporations and of the numerous railway companies whose lines are alleged to be owned, managed, or controlled by the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies.</p>\n<p>Can such a controversy be determined, with due regard to the interests of all concerned, by a suit solely between the State of Minnesota and the Northern Securities Company?  It is indeed alleged that all of the stockholders of the Northern Securities Company are stockholders in the two railroad companies, and therefore it may be said that the latter stockholders are sufficiently represented in the litigation by the Northern Securities Company; but it is not alleged that the stockholders of the Northern Securities Company constitute or are composed of all the stockholders of the two railroad companies, and in fact the contrary is conceded in the allegations of the bill that a majority only of the stock of one, or perhaps both, of the two railroad companies is owned, or at least controlled and managed, by the Northern Securities Company.  It is obvious, therefore, that the rights of the minority stockholders of the two railroad companies are not represented by the Northern Securities Company.  They have a right to be represented in the controversy by the companies whose stock they hold, and their rights ought not to be affected without a hearing, even if </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 184 U. S. 246</a></p><p> it were conceded that a majority of the stock in such companies, held by a few persons, had assisted in forming some sort of an illegal arrangement.  Moreover, it must not be overlooked that it is not the private interests of stockholders that are to be alone considered.  The directors of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railway companies are appointed to represent and protect not merely the private and pecuniary interests of the stockholders, but the rights of the public at large, which is deeply concerned in the proper and advantageous management of these public highways.  It is not sufficient to say that the attorney general, or the governor, or even the legislature of the state can be conclusively deemed to represent the public interests in such a controversy as that presented by the bill.  Even a state, when she voluntarily becomes a complainant in a court of equity, cannot claim to represent both sides of the controversy.  Not only have the stockholders, be they few or many, a right to be heard, through the officers and directors whom they have legally selected to represent them, but the general interests of the public, which might be deeply affected by the decree of the court, are entitled to be heard, and that, when the state is the complainant and in a case like the present, can only be effected by the presence of the railroad companies as parties defendant.</p>\n<p>Upon investigation, it might turn out that the allegations of the bill are well founded, and that the state is entitled to relief, or it might turn out that there is no intention or design on the part of the railroad companies to form any combination in disregard of the policy of the state, but that what is proposed is consistent with that policy and advantageous to the communities affected.  But, in making such investigation, a court of equity must insist that both sides of the controversy shall be adequately represented and fully heard.</p>\n<p>When it appears to a court of equity that a case otherwise presenting ground for its action cannot be dealt with because of the absence of essential parties, it is usual for the court, while sustaining the objection, to grant leave to the complainant to amend by bringing in such parties.  But when it likewise appears that necessary and indispensable parties are beyond </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 184 U. S. 247</a></p><p> the reach of the jurisdiction of the court, or that, when made parties, the jurisdiction of the court will thereby be defeated, for the court to grant leave to amend would be useless.  Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>As, then, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railway companies are indispensable parties, without whose presence the Court, acting as a court of equity, cannot proceed, and as our constitutional jurisdiction would not extend to the case if those companies were made parties defendant, the motion for leave to file the proposed bill must be and is</p>\n<p><em>Denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
