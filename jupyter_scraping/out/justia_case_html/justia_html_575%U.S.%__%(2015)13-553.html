Motor carriers pay an alternative fuel-excise tax on diesel, but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise tax.  Respondent (CSX), an interstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State\xe2\x80\x99s asymmetrical tax treatment \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates against a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act of 1976, or 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act,\n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711501(b)(4).  This Court held that a tax \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d under subsection (b)(4) when it treats \xe2\x80\x9cgroups [that] are similarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d differently without sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cjustification for the difference in treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>CSX Transp. </i>v. <i>Ala. Dept. of Revenue</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 277\n (<i>CSX I</i>).  On remand, the District Court rejected CSX\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that CSX could establish discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors, but rejected Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s argument that imposing a fuel-excise tax on motor carriers, but not rail carriers, justified imposing the sales tax on rail carriers, but not motor carriers.</p>\n<p>Held:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n            \n        1.\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX\xe2\x80\x99s competitors are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection (b)(4) claim.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        All general and commercial taxpayers may be <i>an</i> appropriate<i> </i>comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim, but it is not the only one.  Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.  Context confirms this reading.  The 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act is an \xe2\x80\x9casymmetrical statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CSX I</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 296.  In subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3)\xe2\x80\x94which specify prohibitions directed toward property taxes\xe2\x80\x94the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.  But subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, so the comparison class is to be determined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.  Thus, when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its transportation industry competitors, its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.  Because subsection (b)(4) requires a showing of <i>discrimination</i>, however, the comparison class must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        Subsection (b)(4) would be deprived of all real-world effect if \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d were given the same narrow construction the concept has in the Equal Protection Clause context, where it would be permissible for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier, despite their seemingly similar lines of business.  The category of \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d (b)(4) comparison classes must at least include the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other subsections.  But it also can include a railroad\xe2\x80\x99s competitors.  Discrimination in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d and frustrates the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of \xe2\x80\x9crestor[ing]  the financial stability of the [Nation\xe2\x80\x99s] railway system\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cfoster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n90Stat.\n33.  Contrary to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s argument, normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation to \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial\xe2\x80\x9d in the first three provisions, and its absence in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.  Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s additional arguments are also unavailing.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n            \n        2.\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax.  It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay <i>another</i> comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt, since <i>both </i>competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.  <i>Gregg Dyeing Co. </i>v. <i>Query</i>,\n\n286 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472\n\xe2\x80\x93480.  Similarly, an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity non-discriminatory.  CSX\xe2\x80\x99s counterarguments are rejected.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit is to consider whether Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-tax exemption.  Although the State cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its water carrier exemption, the court should also examine whether any of the State\xe2\x80\x99s alternative rationales justify that exemption.

Here, we address the meaning of these two quoted phrases.</p><p>A</p><p>                    The first question in this case is who is the \xe2\x80\x9ccomparison class\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of a subsection (b)(4) claim.  Alabama argues that the only appropriate comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim is all general commercial and industrial taxpayers.  We disagree.  While all general and commercial taxpayers is <i>an</i> appropriate<i> </i>comparison class, it is not the only one.</p><p>                    Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.  If, for example, a State offers free college education to all returning combat veterans, but arbitrarily excepts those who served in the Marines, we would say that Marines have experienced discrimination.  That would remain the case even though the Marines are treated the same way as members of the general public, who have to pay for their education.</p><p>                    Context confirms that the comparison class for subsection (b)(4) is not limited as Alabama suggests.  The 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act is an \xe2\x80\x9casymmetrical statute.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.,</i> at 296.  Subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3) contain three specific prohibitions directed towards property taxes.  Each requires comparison of railroad property to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.  The Act therefore limits the comparison class for challenges under those provisions.  Even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favor-ably than residential property, no violation of these subsec-tions has occurred. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, leaving the comparison class to be determined as it is normally determined with respect to discrimination claims.  And we think that depends on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.  When a railroad alleges that a tax targets it for worse treatment than local businesses, all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are the comparison class.  When a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its competitors in the transportation industry, the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.</p><p>                    So, picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy.  Unlike under subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3), the railroad is not limited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers; all the world, or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdiction, is its comparison-class oyster.  But that is not as generous a concession as might seem.  What subsection (b)(4) requires, and subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) do not, is a showing of <i>discrimination\xe2\x80\x94</i>of a failure to treat similarly situated persons alike.  A comparison class will thus support a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.</p><p>                    That raises the question of when a proposed comparison class qualifies as similarly situated.  In the Equal Protection Clause context, very few taxpayers are regarded as similarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment.  There, a State may tax different lines of businesses differently with near-impunity, even if they are apparently similar.  We have upheld or approved of distinctions between utilities\xe2\x80\x94including a railroad\xe2\x80\x94and other corporations, <i>New York Rapid Transit Corp. </i>v. <i>City of New York</i>,303 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573,579 (1938), between wholesalers and retailers in goods, <i>Caskey Baking Co. </i>v. <i>Virginia</i>,313 U.\xc2\xa0S. 117\xe2\x80\x93121 (1941), between chain retail stores and independent retail stores, <i>State Bd. of Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Ind.</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>,283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 527\xe2\x80\x93542 (1931), between anthracite coal mines and bituminous coal mines, <i>Heisler </i>v. <i>Thomas Colliery Co</i>.,260 U.\xc2\xa0S. 245,254,257 (1922), and between sellers of coal oil and sellers of coal, <i>Southwestern Oil Co. </i>v. <i>Texas</i>,217 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114,121 (1910).  As one treatise has observed, we recognize a \xe2\x80\x9cwide latitude state legislatures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the Equal Protection Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation \xc2\xb63.03[1], p. 3\xe2\x80\x935 (3d ed. 2001\xe2\x80\x932005).  This includes the power to impose \xe2\x80\x9cwidely different taxes on various trades or professions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x935 to 3\xe2\x80\x936. It would be permissible\xe2\x80\x94as far as the Equal Protection Clause is concerned\xe2\x80\x94for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier, despite the seeming similarity in their lines of business.</p><p>                    The concept of \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d individuals cannot be so narrow here.  That would deprive subsection (b)(4) of all real-world effect, providing protection that the Equal Protection Clause already provides.  Moreover, the cate-gory of \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d (b)(4) comparison classes must include commercial and industrial taxpayers.  There is no conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property taxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class vis-\xc3\xa0-vis railroads.  And we think the competitors of railroads can be another \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d comparison class, since discrimination in favor of that class most obviously frustrates the purpose of the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act, which was to \xe2\x80\x9crestore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(a),90Stat.33, while \xe2\x80\x9cfoster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(b)(2).  We need not, and thus do not, express any opinion on what other comparison classes may qualify.  Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p><p>                      Alabama claims that because subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3) (and (b)(2) through reference to (b)(1)) establish a comparison class of \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property,\xe2\x80\x9d subsection (b)(4) must establish a comparison class of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral commercial and industrial taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d  This inverts normal rules of interpretation, which would say that the explicit limitation to \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial\xe2\x80\x9d in the first three provisions, and the absence of such a limitation in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.  Moreover, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would require us to dragoon the modifier \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but not the noun \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from the first three provisions, append \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d in front of it and \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d after, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.  We might also have to strip away the restrictions in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property,\xe2\x80\x9d which excludes land primarily used for agricultural purposes and timber growing.49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711501(a)(4).  This is not our concept of fidelity to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.</p><p>                    Alabama responds that the introductory clause of \xc2\xa711501(b)\xe2\x80\x94which declares that the \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbinds its four subsections together,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 23 (emphasis deleted), and gives them a common object and scope.  The last time this case appeared before us, Alabama made a similar argument in support of the claim that, because subsections (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) cover only property taxes, so too does subsection (b)(4).  See Brief for Respondents in <i>CSX Transp., Inc. </i>v. <i>Alabama Dept. of Revenue</i>, O. T. 2010, No. 09\xe2\x80\x93520, p. 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  We rejected this argument then, and we reject it again now.</p><p>                    Alabama persists that a case-specific inquiry allows a railroad to \xe2\x80\x9chand-pick [its] comparison class,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 41, which would be unfair\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d to railroads.  <i>Ibid</i>.  As we have described above, picking a class is easy, but it is not easy to establish that the selected class is \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of discrimina-tion in taxation.                     The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that, in light of CSX Transportation\xe2\x80\x99s complaint and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation, a comparison class of competitors consisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appropriate, and differential treatment vis-\xc3\xa0-vis that class would constitute discrimination.  We therefore turn tothe court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consider Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s alternative tax justifications.</p><p>B</p><p>                    A State\xe2\x80\x99s tax discriminates only where the State cannot sufficiently justify differences in treatment between similarly situated taxpayers.  As we have discussed above, a rail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly situated for purposes of this provision.  But what about the claim that those competitors are subject to <i>other </i>taxes that the railroads avoid?  We think Alabama can justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use tax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax.</p><p>                    It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay <i>another</i> comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt.  If that were true, <i>both </i>competitors could claim to be disfavored\xe2\x80\x94discriminated against\xe2\x80\x94relative to each other.  Our negative Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.  <i>Gregg Dyeing Co. </i>v. <i>Query</i>,286 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472\xe2\x80\x93480 (1932).  We think that an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that rendersa tax disparity nondiscriminatory.</p><p>                    CSX claims that because the statutory prohibition forbids \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,\xe2\x80\x9d49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711501(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d in the singular\xe2\x80\x94the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged <i>tax </i>discriminates, not whether the tax code as a whole does so.  It is undoubtedly correct that the \xe2\x80\x9ctax\xe2\x80\x9d (singular) must discriminate\xe2\x80\x94but it does not discriminate unless it treats railroads differently from other <i>similarly situated </i>taxpayers <i>without sufficient justification</i>.  A comparable tax levied on a competitor may justify not extending that competitor\xe2\x80\x99s exemption from a general tax to a railroad.  It is easy to display the error of CSX\xe2\x80\x99s single-tax-provision approach.  Under that model, the following tax would violate the 4\xe2\x80\x93R Act: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) All railroads shall pay a 4% sales tax.  (2) All other individuals shall also pay a 4% sales tax.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>                    CSX would undoubtedly object that not every case will be so easy, and that federal courts are ill qualified to explore the vagaries of state tax law.  We are inclined to agree, but that cannot carry the day.  Congress assigned this task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination command in such sweeping terms.  There is simply no discrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes.  If the task of determining when that is so is \xe2\x80\x9cSisyphean,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Eleventh Circuit called it, 720 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 871, it is a Sisyphean task that the statute imposes.  We therefore cannot approve of the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consider Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s tax-based justification, and remand for that court to consider whether Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-tax exemption.</p><p>C</p><p>                    While the State argues that the existence of a fuel-excise tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers from the sales and use tax, it cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its exemption for water carriers.  Water carriers pay neither tax.</p><p>                    The State, however, offers other justifications for the water carrier exemption\xe2\x80\x94for example, that such an exemption is compelled by federal law.  The Eleventh Circuit failed to examine these justifications, asserting that the water carriers were the beneficiaries of a discriminatory tax regime.  We do not consider whether Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s alternative rationales justify its exemption, but leave that question for the Eleventh Circuit on remand.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3246254">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p>No. 13-553</p>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p>ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al., PETITIONERS <em>v.</em> CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.</p>\n<p>on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p>[March 4, 2015]</p>\n<p><span>Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.</span><br/></p>\n<p>In order to violate 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa711501(b)(4), \xe2\x80\x9ca tax exemption scheme must target or single out railroads by comparison to general commercial and industrial taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v.

Because CSX cannot prove facts that would satisfy that standard, I would reverse the judgment below and remand for the entry of judgment in favor of the Alabama Department of Revenue.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>Last time this case was before the Court, I explained in detail my reasons for interpreting \xe2\x80\x9canother tax that discriminates against a rail carrier\xe2\x80\x9d in 11501(b)(4) to refer to a tax \xe2\x80\x9cthat targets or singles out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at<em></em> 298. I briefly summarize that reasoning here.</p>\n<p>Because the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous at first glance, I look to the term\xe2\x80\x99s context to resolve this uncertainty. <em>Id.</em>, at 298-299. Both the structure and background of the statute indicate that subsection (b)(4) prohibits only taxes that single out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, the meaning of which is best understood by reference to the provisions that precede it. Subsection (b) begins by announcing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he following acts . . . discriminate against interstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d and are prohibited. 11501(b). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) then list three tax-related actions that single out rail carriers by treating rail property differently from all other commercial and industrial property. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711501(b)(1)-(3); <em>id.</em>, at 300. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3) explicitly identify \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property\xe2\x80\x9d as the comparison class, and subsection (b)(2) incorporates that comparison class by reference. 11501(b); <em>id.</em>, at 300. Subsection (b)(4) refers back to these provisions when it forbids \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mpos[ing] <em>another</em> tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) (emphasis added); <em>id.</em>, at 300). The statutory structure therefore supports the conclusion that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out railroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the general class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. <em>Id.</em>, at 300-301.</p>\n<p>The statutory background supports the same conclusion. When Congress enacted the 4-R Act, it was apparent that railroads were \xe2\x80\x9ceasy prey for State and local tax assessors in that they are nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for local taxation, who cannot easily remove themselves from the locality.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 301 (internal quotation marks omitted). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) thus \xe2\x80\x9cestablish a political check\xe2\x80\x9d by preventing States from imposing excessive property taxes on railroads \xe2\x80\x9cwithout imposing the same taxes more generally on voting, resident local businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em> Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as addressing the same problem in the same way. <em>Id.</em>, at 301-302.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s tax scheme cannot be said to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[e] against a rail carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 302. To begin, the scheme does not single out rail carriers. Although one would not know it from the majority opinion, the tax is not directed at rail carriers, their property, their activity, or goods uniquely consumed by them. It is instead a generally applicable sales tax. It applies (with other exemptions not at issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or stored in the State of Alabama. Ala. Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa740-23-2(1), 40-23-61(a) (2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is diesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid, 40-17-325(b), and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from buying such diesel. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13 (acknowledging that CSX pays the motor fuel tax on the diesel fuel it uses in trucks and other on-road vehicles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special carve-out from this sales tax, \xc2\xa740-23-4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014), but that exemption singles out <em>water</em> carriers, not <em>rail</em> carriers.</p>\n<p>Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s sales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the general class of their interstate competitors, the tax surely does not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial and industrial taxpayers. Those taxpayers are subject to exactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax regime as are rail carriers.</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>The Court started off on the wrong track in <em>CSX I</em> when it relied on a generic dictionary definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more specific definition. See 562 U.S., at 304. Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision continues that error.</p>\n<p>The Court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d addressed by the statute encompasses <em>any</em> distinction between rail carriers and their comparison class, <em>ante</em>, at 4, as opposed to mere \xe2\x80\x9csingling out\xe2\x80\x9d or something in between, even though the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d is ambiguous in that way. <em>CSX I</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 299. The Court\xe2\x80\x99s usual practice has not been to treat the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d so casually. See generally <em>Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of New York City</em>, 463 U.S. 582-593 (1983) (opinion of White, J.) (discussing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s shifting definition of the ambiguous term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision compounds this error by holding that a rail carrier may make out a claim of discrimination using any comparison class so long as that class consists of \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals similarly situated to the claimant\xe2\x80\x9d rail carrier. <em>Ante</em>, at 5. The majority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to proceed: After all, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary contains no entry defining what it means to be \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of subsection (b)(4). Forced finally to turn to the statutory context, the majority rejects the statutorily defined competitor class of commercial and industrial taxpayers in favor of a shifting comparison class of its own creation.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>The majority disregards the commercial and industrial property comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1) through (3) because subsection (b)(4) does not explicitly include language from those provisions. See <em>ante</em>, at 4-5, 6-7. It asserts that defining the comparison class for the purpose of subsection (b)(4) by reference to the comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) \xe2\x80\x9cwould require us to dragoon the modifier \xe2\x80\x98commercial and industrial\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but not the noun \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94from the first three provisions, append general in front of it and \xe2\x80\x98taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 after, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s accusation of grammatical conscription misses the point. Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, explicitly marked as such by the use of the word another. See <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003) . Like other residual clauses, it need not use the same language as the clauses it follows to derive meaning from those clauses. See, <em>e.g., Sossamon v. Texas</em>, 563 U.S. 277 , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); <em>James v. United States</em>, 550 U.S. 192-218 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Where, as here, a residual clause includes an ambiguous word like \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates,\xe2\x80\x9d we must look to the clauses that precede it to guide our understanding of its scope.</p>\n<p>In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d is no different from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s: to determine what type of differential treatment the statute forbids. The first three clauses provide important clues that the statute forbids singling out rail carriers from other commercial and industrial taxpayers because commercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones who pay taxes on \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial and industrial property.\xe2\x80\x9d The majority pursues the same logical train of thought when it opines that \xe2\x80\x9cthe category of \xe2\x80\x98similarly situated\xe2\x80\x99 (b)(4) comparison classes must include commercial and indus-trial taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property taxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class vis-\xc3\xa0-vis railroads. <em>Ante</em>, at 6. Where we part ways is in the inferences we draw from the statutory context.</p>\n<p>Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not require the grammatical distortions that the majority alleges. The word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(4) is not a referential phrase whose antecedent is uncertain. If it were, then it would be necessary to select an antecedent that would fit grammatically in place of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely to clarify an ambiguity in the <em>meaning</em>  of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates,\xe2\x80\x9d a task that does not require me to \xe2\x80\x9cdragoon\xe2\x80\x9d the language of the prior clauses into subsection (b)(4).</p>\n<p>Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of \xc2\xa711501(b) to supply a general limitation on the independent prohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4). See <em>United States v. Aguilar</em>, 515 U.S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing this type of argument). That is what Alabama sought to do in <em>CSX I</em> when it argued that subsection (b)(4) is limited to property taxes (or their equivalent \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu\xe2\x80\x9d taxes). <em>Ante</em>, at 7; <em>CSX I</em>, 562 U.S., at 285 (majority opinion). I joined the majority in rejecting that argument. <em>Id.</em>, at 297 (dissenting opinion). But whereas there is no uncertainty about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (b)(4) that would justify importing the property tax limitation from the three preceding subsections, <em>id.</em>, at 284-285 (majority opinion), there is a good deal of uncertainty about the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminates.\xe2\x80\x9d This uncertainty justifies looking to the three previous clauses to understand the type of differential treatment \xc2\xa711501(b) is meant to prohibit. <em>Id.</em>, at 298-299 (dissenting opinion); see <em>Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.</em>, 446 U.S. 578-589 (1980). And those three previous clauses easily supply the answer to the comparison class question.</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>Unwilling to so limit the range of available comparison classes, the majority takes an approach to determining which individuals are \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the statute that \xe2\x80\x9cis almost entirely ad hoc,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>James</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It asserts that the comparison class will \xe2\x80\x9cdepen[d] on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 4-5. Sometimes the comparison class will be \xe2\x80\x9call other commercial and industrial taxpayers,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes it will be \xe2\x80\x9cthe railroad\xe2\x80\x99s competitors\xe2\x80\x9d in a particular jurisdiction, and sometimes it may be some other comparison class entirely. <em>Id.</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p>The sole evidence on which the majority relies to conclude that competitors are similarly situated, and therefore qualify as a comparison class, is the professed purposes of the Act: \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 while \xe2\x80\x98foster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting 90 Stat. 33, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(a), (b)(2)). Interpreting statutory text solely in light of purpose, absent any reliance on text or structure, is dangerous business because it places courts in peril of substituting their policy judgment for that of Congress. In considering statutory purpose, therefore, we should be careful that any inferences of purpose are tied to text rather than instinct.</p>\n<p>The majority throws such caution to the wind. Its two-sentence argument is a perfect illustration of the dangers of a purely purpose-based approach. The majority cherry-picks two of a number of stated goals of a complex piece of legislation over 100 pages long and assumes that this specific provision was assigned to those specific purposes. And then it interprets the statute to perform in the manner the majority believes is best designed to \xe2\x80\x9crestore .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. financial stability\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfoster .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. competition.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p>I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors threatens their financial stability and impedes competition, but I lack the majority\xe2\x80\x99s certitude that \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) is designed to further <em>those</em> <em>goals</em> by combatting <em>that evil</em>, at least<em></em> in <em>the way</em> the majority asserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide strong textual evidence that \xc2\xa711501(b) was designed to stabilize rail carriers by protecting them from discrimination against interstate commerce. And they provide evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen mechanism for accomplishing that goal: tying the fate of interstate rail carriers to the broader class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. See <em>supra</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>The introductory clause of \xc2\xa711501(b) provides further evidence that the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is targeted is not discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors, but \xe2\x80\x9cacts [that] unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d The majority\xe2\x80\x99s response to this evidence\xe2\x80\x94that the Court rejected a similar argument when it refused to limit subsection (b)(4) to property taxes or their kin, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x94is a non sequitur. The introductory clause contains no reference to property taxes that \xe2\x80\x9cbinds its four subsections together\xe2\x80\x9d as prohibitions on discriminatory property taxes. <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted). But it <em>does</em> have a reference to discrimination against interstate commerce, which <em>does</em> tie the sections together to serve <em>that</em> common statutory purpose. This, in turn, weighs against the majority\xe2\x80\x99s inferences about how \xc2\xa711501(b) relates to the stated purposes of the 4-R Act.</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that competitors are a permissible comparison class completely ignores these contextual clues, permitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statutory goals by a different mechanism than its three predecessor clauses. And it leads to odd inconsistencies. If we were to understand the provision as<em></em> prohibiting <em>only</em> discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors, then it might well further the goal of promoting competition between interstate carriers. But the majority instead selects a shifting-comparison-class approach, requiring rail carriers to be treated at least as well as their competitors and <em>any other</em> similarly situated taxpayers. See <em>ante</em>, at 4-5. This most-favored taxpayer status is a position the competitors do not enjoy, so the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position could result in tax schemes that <em>impede</em> competition between interstate carriers rather than promote it.</p>\n<p>Identifying \xe2\x80\x9csimilarly situated\xe2\x80\x9d taxpayers by the undisciplined approach the majority endorses could well lead to other unanticipated consequences. This is why the policy judgments needed to link statutory mechanisms to statutory purposes are best left to Congress. If this Court is going to adopt a shifting-comparison-class approach to \xc2\xa711501(b)(4), then it should at least demand a stronger textual link between the comparison class a claimant seeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any purpose that the claimant argues it serves.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>Because the majority adopts an interpretation of \xc2\xa711501(b)(4) that is not grounded in the text, it should come as no surprise that this interpretation is difficult to apply, as this case demonstrates. It is easy to see how, accepting water carriers as a comparison class, the scheme treats water carriers and rail carriers differently when it grants water carriers, but not rail carriers, an exemption from the sales tax. Ala. Code \xc2\xa740-23-4(a)(10). Identifying the difference in treatment between rail and motor carriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more imagination.</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach exhibits that imagination. It glosses over the general applicability of the provisions that apply to rail and motor carriers, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State applies the [sales or use] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to railroads\xe2\x80\x99 purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail operations,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cexempts from the tax purchases and uses of diesel fuel made by [motor carriers].\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 1. A quick glimpse at the code reveals that this is not quite the case. The applicability of the sales and use taxes does not depend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether the purchaser pays another excise tax, \xc2\xa740-17-325(b), which in turn depends on the nature of the product purchased and its use, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa740-17-328, 40-17-329, which in turn merely correlates to the carriers\xe2\x80\x99 operations.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that is exempt from the motor fuel tax\xe2\x80\x94and therefore subject to the sales and use taxes\xe2\x80\x94as a matter of choice rather than necessity. Dyed diesel has no special properties that make it more suitable for use in a train engine; the dye merely identifies it as exempt from the federal excise tax, \xc2\xa740-17-322(21). And no law prohibits rail carriers from using undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor carriers who are<em></em> prohibited from using the dyed variant for on-road use.</p>\n<p>Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that state law provides that only dyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a little easier to make an argument that the State treats rail carriers differently <em>in this case</em>. But the majority still faces a line-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good subject to the challenged tax be the same as the good on which the competitor enjoys an exemption? Could a rail carrier that relies on natural gas rather than diesel for motive power make the same claim of discrimination if natural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax exemption as diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its competitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a rail carrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a hypothetical provision that exempted from the sales and use taxes diesel that motor carriers use for refrigeration in refrigerated trailers?</p>\n<p>The majority never answers these questions. \xe2\x80\x9cSufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d it intones. <em>Ante</em>, at 6. \xe2\x80\x9cThat gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the\xe2\x80\x9d statute is applied consistently. <em>James</em>, 550 U.S., at 215 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). We have demanded clarity from Congress when it comes to statutes that \xe2\x80\x9cse[t] limits upon the taxation authority of state government, an authority we have recognized as central to state sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc.</em>, 510 U.S. 332-345 (1994). We should demand the same of ourselves when we interpret those statutes. Yet after today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, lower courts, soon to be met with an oyster\xe2\x80\x99s shellful of comparison classes, <em>ante</em>, at 5, will have no idea how to determine when a tax exemption that is not tied to the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s status constitutes differential treatment of two taxpayers.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa711501(b)(1) derails ambiguous text from clarifying context. The result it reaches is predictably unworkable. And it prolongs Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s burden of litigating a baseless claim of discrimination that should have been dismissed long ago. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
