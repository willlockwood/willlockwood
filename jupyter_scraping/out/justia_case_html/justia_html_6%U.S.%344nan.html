S. 356</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In this case the Court has attentively considered the record, proceedings, and evidence.  The only equity of the complainant\'s bill as to Lamar and Beall arises out of the transactions between him and the defendant Smith, and the Court is of opinion that that equity is not supported, and that the material allegations of the bill as to the defendant Smith, and which are denied by his answer, are also unsupported by the evidence.  Nor are the allegations of the complainant respecting his certificate of discharge sufficiently proved.</p>\n<p>By the separation of the District of Columbia from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 6 U. S. 357</a></p><p> the State of Maryland, the complainant ceased to be a citizen of that state, his residence being in the City of Washington at the time of that separation.</p>\n<p>As the complainant was entitled to a discharge upon executing the deed of assignment of all his effects to the trustee appointed by the chancellor, his certificate would relate back to the date of the deed.  It has been said that the true date of that deed was 23 December, 1800, and that the certificate of the chancellor, which states the date to be 23 March, 1801, is correct.</p>\n<p>But the certificate of the chancellor is the only evidence before the court as to that subject.  It is therefore not material to inquire whether the inhabitants of the City of Washington ceased to be citizens of Maryland 27 February, 1801, or on the first Monday of December, 1800, as it is not contended that they were under the jurisdiction of Maryland so late 23 March, 1801.</p>\n<p>The complainant therefore, not being a citizen of Maryland at the time of executing the deed, did not bring himself within the provisions of the insolvent law under which he claims relief.</p>\n<p>I was inclined at first to think that an account might have been directed between the complainant and the defendant Smith, but the Court is of opinion that if he has any remedy against Smith, it is at law, and not in equity.  The bill must be dismissed with costs, but without prejudice.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
