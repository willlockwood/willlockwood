It also requires them to disclose in their advertisements for certain services that the services are with respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs in this litigation\xe2\x80\x94a law firm and others (collectively Milavetz)\xe2\x80\x94filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, arguing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s debt-relief-agency provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertisements.  The District Court found that \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d does not include attorneys and that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526 and 528 are unconstitutional as applied to that class of professionals.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that attorneys are not \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d; upholding application of \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from advising assisted persons to incur <em>any</em> additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA.

Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude attorneys.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(12A)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(E).  Milavetz relies on the fact that \xc2\xa7101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a narrower understanding.  On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition preparer would qualify\xe2\x80\x94an implausibility given that a \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance \xe2\x80\xa6 or<em> </em>who is a bankruptcy petition preparer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.<font b="1"> </font></em><font b="1">Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive.

The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, together with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) the natural one.  <em>Conrad, Rubin &amp; Lesser </em>v.<em> Pender</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/472/index.html">289 U. S. 472</a>, supports this conclusion<em>.  </em>The Court in that case read now-repealed \xc2\xa796(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees payment \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of the filing of a petition,\xe2\x80\x9d to require that the portended bankruptcy have \xe2\x80\x9cinduce[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the transfer at issue, <em>id.,</em> at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.  The Court identified the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling question\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Given the substantial similarities between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa796(d) and 526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise whether the impelling reason for \xe2\x80\x9cadvis[ing] an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 to incur more debt\xe2\x80\x9d was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.  In practice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of advice to \xe2\x80\x9cload up\xe2\x80\x9d on debt with the expectation of obtaining its discharge<em>.  </em>The statutory context supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct.  The Court rejects Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s arguments for a more expansive view of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is impermissibly vague.

Consistent with Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, the Court presumes that this is an as-applied challenge.  Because \xc2\xa7528 is directed at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less exacting scrutiny set out in <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/index.html">471 U. S. 626</a>, governs.  There, the Court found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements offend the First Amendment, \xe2\x80\x9can advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing deception of consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 651<em>.</em>  Section 528\xe2\x80\x99s requirements share the essential features of the rule challenged in <em>Zauderer</em>.  The disclosures are intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.  Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying any additional information through their advertisements.  <em>In re R. M. J.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/index.html">455 U. S. 191</a>, distinguished.  Because \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s requirements are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing consumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Milavetz.

Among the reform measures the Act implemented are a number of provisions that regulate the conduct of \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, professionals who provide bankruptcy assistance to consumer debtors.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(3), (12A).  These consolidated cases present the threshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services.  Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must also consider whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions governing debt relief agencies\xe2\x80\x99 advice to clients, \xc2\xa7526(a)(4), and requiring them to make certain disclosures in their advertisements, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of attorneys.  Concluding that the Court of Appeals construed \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment that the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad.  Like the Court of Appeals, we uphold \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements as applied in these consolidated cases.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left"> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Congress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provisions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.  Some of these measures apply to the broad class of bankruptcy professionals termed \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies].\xe2\x80\x9d  That category includes, with limited exceptions, \xe2\x80\x9cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for \xe2\x80\xa6 payment \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101(12A).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cBankruptcy assistance\xe2\x80\x9d refers to goods or services \xe2\x80\x9cprovided to an assisted person with the express or implied purpose of providing information, advice, counsel, document preparation, or filing, or attendance at a creditors\xe2\x80\x99 meeting or appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d in bankruptcy.  \xc2\xa7101(4A).  An \xe2\x80\x9cassisted person\xe2\x80\x9d is someone with limited nonexempt property whose debts consist primarily of consumer debts.  \xc2\xa7101(3).  The BAPCPA subjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions and requirements, as set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526, 527, and 528.  As relevant here, \xc2\xa7526(a) establishes several rules of professional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agencies.  Among them, \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) states that a debt relief agency shall not \xe2\x80\x9cadvise an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include certain disclosures in their advertisements.  Subsection (a) provides that debt relief agencies must \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and conspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy assistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy directed to the general public\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 that the services or benefits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7528(a)(3).  It also requires them to include the following, \xe2\x80\x9cor a substantially similar statement\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a debt relief agency.  We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7528(a)(4).  Subsection (b) requires essentially the same disclosures in advertisements \xe2\x80\x9cindicating that the debt relief agency provides assistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage foreclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7528(b)(2).  Debt relief agencies advertising such services must disclose \xe2\x80\x9cthat the assistance may involve bankruptcy relief,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7528(b)(2)(A), and must identify themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d as required by \xc2\xa7528(a)(4), see \xc2\xa7528(b)(2)(B).  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs in this litigation\xe2\x80\x94the law firm Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A.; the firm\xe2\x80\x99s president, Robert J. Milavetz; a bankruptcy attorney at the firm, Barbara Nilva Nevin; and two of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s clients (collectively Milavetz)\xe2\x80\x94filed a preenforcement suit in Federal District Court seeking declaratory relief with respect to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s debt-relief-agency provisions.  Milavetz asked the court to hold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not identify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in the BAPCPA.  In the alternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526(a)(4) and 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to attorneys.  The District Court agreed with Milavetz that the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d does not include attorneys, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x931119, p.\xc2\xa0A\xe2\x80\x9315, but only after finding that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526 and 528\xe2\x80\x94provisions expressly applicable only to debt relief agencies\xe2\x80\x94are unconstitutional as applied to this class of professionals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  541 F.\xc2\xa03d 785 (2008).  Relying on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, the court unanimously rejected the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that attorneys are not \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act.  The Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District Court concerning the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7528.  Concluding that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer deception and are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to that interest, the court upheld the application of \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements to attorneys.  <em>Id.</em>, at 796\xe2\x80\x93797 (citing <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/index.html">471 U. S. 626</a>, 651 (1985)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed with the District Court that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) is invalid.  Determining that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) \xe2\x80\x9cbroadly prohibits a debt relief agency from advising an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 to incur <em>any</em> additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating bankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d even when that advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bankruptcy laws, 541 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 793, the majority held that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermediate scrutiny.  In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice to abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construction would avoid most constitutional difficulties.  See <em>id.</em>, at 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] we granted certiorari to resolve the question of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  556 U. S. ___ (2009).  We also agreed to consider the threshold question whether attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7101(12A) and the related question whether \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements are constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider whether the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d includes attorneys.  If it does not, we need not reach the other questions presented, as \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526 and 528 govern only the conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz challenges the validity of those provisions based on their application to attorneys.  The Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d plainly includes attorneys, while Milavetz urges that it does not.  We conclude that the Government has the better view.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As already noted, a debt relief agency is \xe2\x80\x9cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person\xe2\x80\x9d in return for payment.  \xc2\xa7101(12A).  By definition, \xe2\x80\x9cbankruptcy assistance\xe2\x80\x9d includes several services commonly performed by attorneys.  Indeed, some forms of bankruptcy assistance, including the \xe2\x80\x9cprovi[sion of] legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(4A), may be provided only by attorneys.  See \xc2\xa7110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from providing legal advice).  Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress gave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101(12A)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(E).  Thus, as the Government contends, the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services to assisted persons.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In advocating a narrower understanding of that term, Milavetz relies heavily on the fact that \xc2\xa7101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys.  That omission stands in contrast, it argues, to the provision\xe2\x80\x99s explicit inclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cbankruptcy petition preparer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a category of professionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see \xc2\xa7110(a)(1).  But Milavetz does not contend, nor could it credibly, that only professionals expressly included in the definition are debt relief agencies.  On that reading, no professional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer would qualify\xe2\x80\x94an implausible reading given that the statute defines \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>or </em>who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7101(12A) (emphasis added).  The provision\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding attorneys thus avails Milavetz little.  Cf. <em>Heintz</em> v. <em>Jenkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/291/index.html">514 U. S. 291</a>, 294 (1995) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cdebt collector\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the definition\xe2\x80\x99s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments for excluding attorneys similarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.  Milavetz contends that 11 U.

We find that \xc2\xa7526(d)(2) supports the opposite conclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact that provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not apply to attorneys.  Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s broader claim that reading \xc2\xa7101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on an area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.  Congress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen aspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial federal concern.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Conrad, Rubin &amp; Lesser</em> v. <em>Pender</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/472/index.html"></a><a href="/us/289/472/index.html">289 U.

In light of that omission, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies will obligate entire law firms to comply with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526, 527, and 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while the agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typically organized as partnerships are shielded from those requirements.  Given that the partnership structure is not unique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclusion would be revealing of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent only with respect to attorneys.  In any event, partnerships are themselves \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under the BAPCPA, see \xc2\xa7101(41), and can qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agenc[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d when they meet the criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7101(12A).  Moreover, a partnership\xe2\x80\x99s employees and agents are exempted from \xc2\xa7101(12A) in the same way as the employees and agents of other organizations.  To the extent that partners may be subject to the debt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is consistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow from the partnership structure, cf. <em>Strang</em> v. <em>Bradner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/114/555/index.html">114 U. S. 555</a>, 561 (1885).<font b="1">  Accordingly, we decline to attribute the significance Milavetz suggests to \xc2\xa7101(12A)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s failure to include partners among the exempted actors.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of constitutional avoidance requires us to read \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude attorneys in order to forestall serious doubts as to the validity of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526 and 528.  The avoidance canon, however, \xe2\x80\x9cis a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/371/index.html">543 U. S. 371</a>, 381 (2005).  In applying that tool, we will consider only those constructions of a statute that are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fairly possible.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Security Industrial Bank</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/70/index.html">459 U.

For the reasons already discussed, the text and statutory context of \xc2\xa7101(12A) foreclose a reading of \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d that excludes attorneys.  Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services, we next address the scope and validity of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4).  Characterizing the statute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client communications that is not adequately tailored to constrain only speech the Government has a substantial interest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule substantially overbroad.  541 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 793\xe2\x80\x93794, and n.\xc2\xa010.  For the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from \xe2\x80\x9cadvis[ing] an assisted person\xe2\x80\x9d either \xe2\x80\x9cto incur more debt in contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d filing for bankruptcy \xe2\x80\x9cor to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services\xe2\x80\x9d performed in preparation for filing.  Only the first of these prohibitions is at issue.  In debating the correctness of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision, the parties first dispute the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa7526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief agency from advising an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 to incur <em>any </em>additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating bankruptcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 793.  Under that reading, an attorney is prohibited from providing all manner of \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial advice\xe2\x80\x94even if the advice could help the assisted person avoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, Milavetz contends that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from advising a client to incur any<em> </em>new debt while considering whether to file for bankruptcy.  Construing the provision more broadly still, Milavetz contends that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) forbids not only affirmative advice but also any discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more debt.  Like the panel majority\xe2\x80\x99s, Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s reading rests primarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy encompasses any advice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might soon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate the need to file.  Milavetz also maintains that if \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) were construed more narrowly, as urged by the Government and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to inevitably chill some protected speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government continues to advocate a narrower construction of the statute, urging that Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s reading is untenable and that its vagueness concerns are misplaced.  The Government contends that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on advice to incur more debt \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to undertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system.  Focusing first on the provision\xe2\x80\x99s text, the Government points to sources indicating that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated with abusive conduct.  For instance, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\xe2\x80\x99s) defines \xe2\x80\x9ccontemplation of bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he thought of declaring bankruptcy because of the inability to continue current financial operations, often coupled with action designed to thwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illustrates that traditional coupling.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x9365, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98loading up\xe2\x80\x99 [on debt] in contemplation of bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x9d); Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 93\xe2\x80\x93137, pt. I, p.\xc2\xa011 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he most serious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of instances in which individuals have purchased a sizable quantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of bankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government also points to early American and English judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re Pearce</em>, 19 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt. 1843); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Brundrett</em>, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296\xe2\x80\x93297, 110 Eng. Rep. 798, 801 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1833) (Parke, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s immediate context.  According to the Government, the other three subsections of \xc2\xa7526(a) are designed to protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief agencies: \xc2\xa7526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to perform all promised services; \xc2\xa7526(a)(2) prohibits them from making or advising debtors to make false or misleading statements in bankruptcy; and \xc2\xa7526(a)(3) prohibits them from misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of bankruptcy.  When \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) is read in context of these debtor-protective provisions, the Government argues, construing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving advice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors seems particularly nonsensical.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x99s remedies for violations of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) similarly corroborate its narrow reading.  Section 526(c) provides remedies for a debt relief agency\xe2\x80\x99s violation of \xc2\xa7526, \xc2\xa7527, or \xc2\xa7528.  Among the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the attorney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue for a resident\xe2\x80\x99s actual damages; and a court finding intentional abuse may impose an appropriate civil penalty.  \xc2\xa7526(c).  The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Hersh </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Mukasey</em>, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d 743 (2008),<em> </em>and Judge Colloton\xe2\x80\x99s dissent below for the observation that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on actual damages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests that Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to debtors which if followed would have a significant risk of harming the debtor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 760; see 541 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 800 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  By contrast, \xe2\x80\x9clegal and appropriate advice that would be protected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a broad reading of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4), should cause no damage at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see <em>Hersh</em>, 541 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 760.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milavetz contends that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sources actually undermine its claim that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct.  Specifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities illustrate that \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy is a neutral phrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to an additional, proscriptive term.  As Black\xe2\x80\x99s states, the phrase is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>often coupled</em> <em>with</em> action designed to thwart the distribution of assets\xe2\x80\x9d in bankruptcy, Black\xe2\x80\x99s 336 (emphasis added), but it carries no independent connotation of abuse.  In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on our decision in <em>Pender</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/472/index.html"></a><a href="/us/289/472/index.html">289 U. S. 472</a>, contending that we construed \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy in that case to describe \xe2\x80\x9cconduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy filing and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Milavetz 61.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reviewing these competing claims, we are persuaded that a narrower reading of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) is sounder, although we do not adopt precisely the view the Government advocates.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s sources show that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d bankruptcy has so commonly been associated with abusive conduct that it may readily be understood to prefigure abuse.  As used in \xc2\xa7526(a)(4), however, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of misconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the bankruptcy system.  In light of our decision in <em>Pender</em>,<em> </em>and in context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Pender</em> addressed the meaning of former \xc2\xa796(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of the filing of a petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Recognizing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in enabling counsel to protect him,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 289 U. S., at 478 (quoting <em>In re Wood &amp; Henderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/210/246/index.html">210 U. S. 246</a>, 253<font b="1"> (1908)), we read \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of \xe2\x80\xa6 filing\xe2\x80\x9d in that context to require that the portended bankruptcy have \xe2\x80\x9cinduce[d]\xe2\x80\x9d the transfer at issue, 289 U. S., at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.  In so construing the statute, we identified the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling question\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Given the substantial similarities between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa796(d) and 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the latter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason for \xe2\x80\x9cadvis[ing] an assisted person \xe2\x80\xa6 to incur more debt\xe2\x80\x9d was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, there are relevant differences between the provision at issue in <em>Pender </em>and the one now under review.  Most notably, the inquiry in <em>Pender </em>was as to payments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) regards advice to incur additional debts.  Consistent with that difference, under \xc2\xa796(d) a finding that a payment was made \xe2\x80\x9cin contemplation of\xe2\x80\x9d filing resolved only a threshold inquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of the payment; the finding thus supported an inference of abuse but did not conclusively establish it.  By contrast, advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as prohibited by \xc2\xa7526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to \xe2\x80\x9cload up\xe2\x80\x9d on debt with the expectation of obtaining its discharge\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, conduct that is abusive <em>per se</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory context supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition primarily targets this type of abuse.  Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already sought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing.  Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the attendant risk of manipulation by preventing the discharge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making debts for purchases of luxury goods or services presumptively nondischargeable.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000 ed.).  The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, however, by providing a new mechanism for determining a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to repay.  Pursuant to the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans tes[t],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s petition for Chapter 7 relief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dismissed or converted to a structured repayment plan under Chapter 13) if the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current monthly income exceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including payments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed amount.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iv).  The test promotes debtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur additional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured debts offset a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly income under the formula.  Other amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a concern with this practice.  For instance, Congress amended \xc2\xa7523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge by lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor must assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling window.  See \xc2\xa7310, 119 Stat. 84.  In context, \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) is best understood to provide an additional safeguard against the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contextual arguments provide additional support for the view that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) was meant to prevent this type of conduct.  The companion rules of professional conduct in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(3) and the remedies for their violation in \xc2\xa7526(c) indicate that Congress was concerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or creditors.  Unlike the reasonable financial advice the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s broad reading would proscribe, advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a substantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors.  See <em>Hersh</em>, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 760\xe2\x80\x93761.  Specifically, the incurrence of such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition conduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargable, see \xc2\xa7523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or dismiss it altogether, see \xc2\xa7707(b), thereby defeating his effort to obtain bankruptcy relief.  If a debt, although manipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abusive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm as a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of the bankruptcy estate.  By contrast, the prudent advice that the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view of the statute forbids would likely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very least should cause no harm.  See <em>id.</em>, at 760; 541 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  For all of these reasons, we conclude that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an assisted person to incur more debt when the impelling reason for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o other solution yields as sensible a\xe2\x80\x9d result further persuades us of the correctness of this narrow reading.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Granderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/39/index.html">511 U. S. 39</a>, 55 (1994).<font b="1">  It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys and other debt relief agencies from advising individuals thinking of filing for bankruptcy about options that would be beneficial to both those individuals and their creditors.  That construction serves none of the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code or the amendments enacted through the BAPCPA.  Milavetz itself acknowledges that its expansive view of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) would produce absurd results; that is one of its bases for arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d should be construed to exclude attorneys.  Because the language and context of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted purpose, we can avoid the absurdity of which Milavetz complains without reaching the result it advocates.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reason, we reject Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from discussing<em> </em>covered subjects instead of merely proscribing affirmative advice to undertake a particular action.  Section 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies only from \xe2\x80\x9cadvis[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d assisted persons \xe2\x80\x9cto incur\xe2\x80\x9d more debt.  Covered professionals remain free to \xe2\x80\x9ctal[k] fully and candidly <em>about </em>the incurrence of debt in contemplation of filing a bankruptcy case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Milavetz 73.  Section 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid instructing or encouraging assisted persons to take on more debt in that circumstance.  Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cA lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even if the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach the same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition of frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within the statutory scheme.  Cf. <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/694/index.html">529 U. S. 694</a>, 706, n.\xc2\xa09 (2000).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we reject Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s contention that, narrowly construed, \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) is impermissibly vague.  Milavetz urges that the concept of abusive prefiling conduct is too indefinite to withstand constitutional scrutiny and that uncertainty regarding the scope of the prohibition will chill protected speech.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our reading of the statute, of course, the prohibited advice is not defined in terms of abusive prefiling conduct but rather the incurrence of additional debt when the impelling reason is the anticipation of bankruptcy.  Even if the test depended upon the notion of abuse, however, Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s claim would be fatally undermined by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which that concept is no stranger.  As discussed above, the Code authorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge fraudulent debts, see \xc2\xa7523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or convert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that granting relief would constitute abuse, see \xc2\xa7707(b)(1).  Attorneys and other professionals who give debtors bankruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their consequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs additional debt prior to filing.  Indeed, \xc2\xa7707(b)(4)(C) states that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s signature on bankruptcy filings \xe2\x80\x9cshall constitute a certification that the attorney has\xe2\x80\x9d determined that the filing \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not constitute an abuse under [\xc2\xa7707(b)(1)].\xe2\x80\x9d  Against this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that narrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising a client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct could chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client relationship.  Our construction of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) to prevent only advice principally motivated by the prospect of bankruptcy further ensures that professionals cannot unknowingly run afoul of its proscription.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Because the scope of the prohibition is adequately defined, both on its own terms and by reference to the Code\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions, we reject Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the foregoing shows, the language of the statute, together with other evidence of its purpose, makes this narrow reading of \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) not merely a plausible interpretation but the more natural one.  Accordingly, we reject the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion and hold that a debt relief agency violates \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) only when the impetus of the advice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for bankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief.  Because our reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for reversing the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision, and because Milavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as narrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further consider whether the statute so construed withstands First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we address the validity of \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s challenged disclosure requirements.  Our first task in resolving this question is to determine the contours of Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Although the nature of its challenge is not entirely clear from the briefing or decisions below, counsel for Milavetz insisted at oral argument that this is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a facial challenge; it\xe2\x80\x99s an as-applied challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.  We will approach the question consistent with Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s characterization.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider the standard of scrutiny applicable to \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements.  The parties agree, as do we, that the challenged provisions regulate only commercial speech.  Milavetz contends that our decision in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/index.html">447 U. S. 557</a> (1980), supplies the proper standard for reviewing these requirements.  The Court in that case held that restrictions on nonmisleading commercial speech regarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94that is, they must \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly advanc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d a substantial governmental interest and be \xe2\x80\x9cn[o] more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 566.  Contesting Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s premise, the Government maintains that \xc2\xa7528 is directed at <em>misleading</em> commercial speech.  For that reason, and because the challenged provisions impose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the Government contends that the less exacting scrutiny described in <em>Zauderer</em> governs our review.  We agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Zauderer </em>addressed the validity of a rule of professional conduct that required attorneys who advertised contingency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that a losing client might still be responsible for certain litigation fees and costs.  Noting that First Amendment protection for commercial speech is justified in large part by the information\xe2\x80\x99s value to consumers, the Court concluded that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally protected interest in <em>not</em> providing the required factual information is \xe2\x80\x9cminimal.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U. S., at 651.  Unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by chilling protected speech, but \xe2\x80\x9can advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing deception of consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The challenged provisions of \xc2\xa7528 share the essential features of the rule at issue in <em>Zauderer</em>.  As in that case, \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s required disclosures are intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial advertisements\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the promise of debt relief without any reference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which has inherent costs.  Additionally, the disclosures entail only an accurate statement identifying the advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s legal status and the character of the assistance provided, and they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz from conveying any additional information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same characteristics of \xc2\xa7528 that make it analogous to the rule in <em>Zauderer </em>serve to distinguish it from those at issue in <em>In re R. M. J.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/index.html">455 U. S. 191</a> (1982), to which the Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of <em>Central Hudson</em>.  The ethical rules addressed in <em>R.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0J. </em>prohibited attorneys from advertising their practice areas in terms other than those prescribed by the State Supreme Court and from announcing the courts in which they were admitted to practice.  See 455 U. S., at 197\xe2\x80\x93198.  Finding that the restricted statements were not inherently misleading and that the State had failed to show that the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements were themselves likely to mislead consumers, see <em>id.</em>, at 205, the Court applied <em>Central Hudson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>intermediate scrutiny and invalidated the restrictions as insufficiently tailored to any substantial state interest, 455 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  In so holding, the Court emphasized that States retain authority to regulate inherently misleading advertisements, particularly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that advertisements for professional services pose a special risk of deception.  See <em>id.</em>, at 203, 207.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government in these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that its advertisements are misleading.  <em>Zauderer </em>forecloses that argument: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the possibility of deception is as self-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the State to \xe2\x80\x98conduct a survey of the \xe2\x80\xa6 public before it [may] determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to mislead.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U. S., at 652\xe2\x80\x93653 (quoting <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Colgate-Palmolive Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/374/index.html">380 U. S. 374</a>, 391\xe2\x80\x93392 (1965)).  Evidence in the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of advertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief without alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998 Hearings, pt. III, at 86, 90\xe2\x80\x9394,<font b="1"> is adequate to establish that the likelihood of deception in this case \xe2\x80\x9cis hardly a speculative one,\xe2\x80\x9d 471 U. S., at 652.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Milavetz alternatively argues that the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d is confusing and misleading and that requiring its inclusion in advertisements cannot be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing consumer deception, as <em>Zauderer </em>requires.  <em>Id.</em>, at 651.  This contention amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s part for referring to itself as something other than a \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, an attorney or a law firm.  For several reasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any constitutional basis.  First, Milavetz offers no evidence to support its claim that the label is confusing.  Because \xc2\xa7528 by its terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclosures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt relief agencies must identify themselves as such in their advertisements.  This statement provides interested observers with pertinent information about the advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s services and client obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other information that Milavetz must or may include in its advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services provides additional assurance that consumers will not misunderstand the term.  The required statement that the advertiser \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d gives meaningful context to the term \xe2\x80\x9cdebt relief agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Milavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attorney.  Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor the disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as the resulting statements are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially similar\xe2\x80\x9d to the statutory examples.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we reject Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa7528 is not reasonably related to any governmental interest because it applies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as Milavetz sometimes does.  The required disclosures, Milavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading in that context.  This claim is premised on an untenable reading of the statute.  We think it evident from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cassisted person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is stated in terms of the person\xe2\x80\x99s debts, see \xc2\xa7101(3)\xe2\x80\x94and from the text and structure of the debt-relief-agency provisions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7526, 527, and 528 that those provisions, including \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements, govern only professionals who offer bankruptcy-related services to consumer debtors.  Section 528 is itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertaining to \xe2\x80\x9cbankruptcy assistance services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits of bankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7528(a)(3) and (b)(2).  Moreover, like the other debt-relief-agency provisions, that section is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code entitled \xe2\x80\x9c<font caps="1">debtor\xe2\x80\x99s duties and benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C., ch. 5, subch. II.  In context, reading \xc2\xa7528 to govern advertisements aimed at creditors would be as anomalous as the result of which Milavetz complains.  Once again, we decline Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to adopt a view of the statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would produce an absurd result.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s requirements that Milavetz identify itself as a debt relief agency and include certain information about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the [Government\xe2\x80\x99s] interest in preventing deception of consumers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Zauderer</em>, 471 U.

See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>34.  This argument fails on its own terms.  Even if \xc2\xa7101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz contends, \xc2\xa7527(b) would still produce the result of which its <em>amici </em>complain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform assisted persons that they \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98can get help in some localities from a bankruptcy petition preparer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and there is no question that bankruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to that requirement.  It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief agencies\xe2\x80\x94whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers\xe2\x80\x94to inform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy-assistance services.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0If read as Milavetz advocates, \xc2\xa7526(a)(4) would seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship.

Reiterating the significance of such dialogue, we note that \xc2\xa7526(a)(4), as narrowly construed, presents no impediment to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98full and frank\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d discussions.  <em>Ibid</em>.

We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of bankruptcy is insufficient to trigger \xc2\xa7526(a)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.  Instead, that provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is principally motivated by that likelihood.  Thus, advice to refinance a mortgage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will reduce the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not prohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than the anticipated filing, is the impelling cause.  Advice to incur additional debt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or make other purchases \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly permissible.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s validity as applied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record.

The Court first notes that statements in the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary \xe2\x80\x9cindicate concern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, n. 3.  Perhaps, but only the concern of the author of the Report.  Such statements tell us nothing about what the statute means, since (1) we do not know that the members of the Committee read the Report, (2) it is almost certain that they did not vote on the Report (that is not the practice), and (3) even if they did read and vote on it, they were not, after all, those who made this law.  The statute before us is a law because its text was approved by a majority vote of the House and the Senate, and was signed by the President.  Even indulging the extravagant assumption that Members of the House other than members of its Committee on the Judiciary read the Report (and the further extravagant assumption that they agreed with it), the Members of the Senate could not possibly have read it, since it did not exist when the Senate passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.  And the President surely had more important things to do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The footnote\xe2\x80\x99s other source of legislative history is truly mystifying.  For the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislative record elsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys\xe2\x80\x9d which was presumably the concern of <em>Congress</em>,<em> </em>the Court cites a reproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an attachment to the written statement of a <em>witness</em>, (2) in a hearing held seven years prior to this statute\xe2\x80\x99s passage, (3) before a subcommittee of the House considering a <em>different</em> consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never passed.<footcall num="*">  \xe2\x80\x9cElsewhere\xe2\x80\x9d indeed.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by this superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary in light of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous language,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03).  But much can be lost.  Our cases have said that legislative history is irrelevant when the statutory text is clear.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (1997); <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Germain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/index.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 254 (1992).  The footnote advises conscientious attorneys that this is not true, and that they must spend time and their clients\xe2\x80\x99 treasure combing the annals of legislative history in <em>all</em> cases: To buttress their case where the statutory text is unambiguously in their favor; and to attack an unambiguous text that is against them.  If legislative history is relevant to confirm that a clear text means what it says, it is presumably relevant to show that an apparently clear text does not mean what it seems to say.  Even for those who believe in the legal fiction that committee reports reflect congressional intent, footnote 3 is a bridge too far.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court protests that the earlier hearing was \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the record cited by the 2005 House Report,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03.

I agree with the Court that 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s advertising disclosure requirements survive First Amendment scrutiny on the record before us.  I write separately because different reasons lead me to that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have never been persuaded that there is any basis in the First Amendment for the relaxed scrutiny this Court applies to laws that suppress nonmisleading commercial speech.  See <em>44 Liquormart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rhode Island</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/484/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/484/index.html">517 U. S. 484</a>, 522\xe2\x80\x93523 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (discussing <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/index.html"></a><a href="/us/447/557/index.html">447 U. S. 557</a> (1980)).  In this case, the Court applies a still lower standard of scrutiny to review a law that compels the disclosure of commercial speech\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the rule articulated in <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/626/index.html">471 U. S. 626</a> (1985), that laws that require the disclosure of factual information in commercial advertising may be upheld so long as they are \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing consumer deception, <em>id.</em>, at 651.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am skeptical of the premise on which <em>Zauderer </em>rests\xe2\x80\x94that, in the commercial-speech context, \xe2\x80\x9cthe First Amendment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 652, n.\xc2\xa014; see <em>id.</em>, at 650 (citing \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have refused in other contexts to attach any \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional significance\xe2\x80\x9d to the difference between regulations that compel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Riley</em> v.<em> National</em> <em>Federation of Blind of N.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>C., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html"></a><a href="/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 796\xe2\x80\x93797 (1988).  I see no reason why that difference should acquire constitutional significance merely because the regulations at issue involve commercial speech.  See <em>Glickman</em> v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/457/index.html">521 U. S. 457</a>, 480\xe2\x80\x93481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting) (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial speech is \xe2\x80\xa6 subject to [this] First Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable speech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is typically subject to the same level of scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 504 (Thomas, J., dissenting); cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>United Foods, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/405/index.html">533 U. S. 405</a>, 419 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring) (stating that regulations that compel funding for commercial advertising \xe2\x80\x9cmust be subjected to the most stringent First Amendment scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine <em>Zauderer</em> and its progeny in an appropriate case to determine whether these precedents provide sufficient First Amendment protection against government-mandated disclosures.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Because no party asks us to do so here, however, I agree with the Court that the <em>Zauderer </em>standard governs our review of the challenge to \xc2\xa7528 brought by the Milavetz law firm and the other plaintiffs in this action (hereinafter Milavetz).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet even under <em>Zauderer</em>, we \xe2\x80\x9chave not presumptively endorsed\xe2\x80\x9d laws requiring the use of \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment-scripted disclaimers\xe2\x80\x9d in commercial advertising.  See <em>Borgner </em>v. <em>Florida Bd. of Dentistry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/1080/index.html">537 U. S. 1080</a>, 1082 (2002) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  <em>Zauderer</em> upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attorney under a rule of professional conduct that required advertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose that losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees and costs.  See 471 U. S., at 650\xe2\x80\x93653.  Importantly, however, Zauderer\xe2\x80\x99s advertisement was found to be misleading on its face, and the regulation in that case did not mandate the specific form or text of the disclosure.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Thus, <em>Zauderer </em>does not stand for the proposition that the government can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted disclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in preventing consumer deception might plausibly be at stake.  In other words, a bare assertion by the government that a disclosure requirement is \xe2\x80\x9cintended\xe2\x80\x9d to prevent consumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to uphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls within its sweep.  See <em>ante</em>, at 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations aimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissible only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular advertising is <em>inherently</em> <em>likely</em> to deceive or where the record indicates that a particular form or method of advertising has <em>in</em> <em>fact</em> been deceptive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re R.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>M.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>J.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/191/index.html">455 U. S. 191</a>, 202 (1982) (emphasis added); see <em>Zauderer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 651 (\xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[ing] that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional muster only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements that, by their nature, possess these traits.  See <em>R.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>M.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>J.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 202; <em>Ibanez </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/136/index.html">512 U. S. 136</a>, 143, 146\xe2\x80\x93147 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to hold otherwise.  See <em>ante</em>, at 20.  Accordingly, and with that understanding, I turn to the question whether Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements survives <em>Zauderer </em>scrutiny on the record before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s challenge inhibits our review of its First Amendment claim.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19, n.\xc2\xa07.  Milavetz challenged \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality before the statute had ever been enforced against any of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements.  Although Milavetz purports to challenge \xc2\xa7528 only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to its own advertising, see <em>ante</em>, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or exhibits to substantiate its claim.  Thus, no court has seen a sampling of Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements or even a declaration describing their contents and the media through which Milavetz seeks to transmit them.  As a consequence, Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s nominal \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d challenge appears strikingly similar to a facial challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We generally disapprove of such challenges because they \xe2\x80\x9coften rest on speculation\xe2\x80\x9d and require courts to engage in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/442/index.html">552 U. S. 442</a>, 450 (2008) (quoting <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 609 (2004)).  Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s claim invites the same problems.  Milavetz alleges that \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements are unconstitutional as applied to its advertisements because its advertisements are not misleading and because the disclaimer required by \xc2\xa7528 will create, rather than reduce, confusion for Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s potential clients.  That may well be true.  But because no record evidence of Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements exists to guide our review, we can only speculate about the ways in which the statute might be applied to Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When forced to determine the constitutionality of a statute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the law if there is any \xe2\x80\x9cconceivabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d manner in which it can be enforced consistent with the First Amendment.  <em>Washington State Grange</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 456.  In this case, both parties agree that \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements cover, at a minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wipe out\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the means of accomplishing this goal.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Brief for Milavetz 82, 86; Brief for United States 60\xe2\x80\x9362.  As a result, there is at least one set of facts on which the statute could be constitutionally applied.  Thus, I agree with the Court that Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to \xc2\xa7528 must fail.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are false or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be proscribed.  See <em>44 Liquormart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rhode Island</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/484/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/484/index.html">517 U. S. 484</a>, 520 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Furthermore, I acknowledge this Court\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding assumption that a consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain factual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on First Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all advertisements that have the potential to mislead.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</em> v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/748/index.html">425 U. S. 748</a>, 771\xe2\x80\x93772 (1976); <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/626/index.html"></a><a href="/us/471/626/index.html">471 U. S. 626</a>, 651\xe2\x80\x93652, n.\xc2\xa014 (1985); <em>Riley</em> v.<em> National</em> <em>Federation of Blind of N.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>C., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/781/index.html"></a><a href="/us/487/781/index.html">487 U. S. 781</a>, 796, n.\xc2\xa09 (1988); <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/557/index.html"></a><a href="/us/447/557/index.html">447 U. S. 557</a>, 565 (1980).  But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt that it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations that compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0At oral argument, Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s counsel declined to describe Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to \xc2\xa7528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25\xe2\x80\x9326, and Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s briefs make no such contention.  But even viewing Milavetz\xe2\x80\x99s argument as a claim that \xc2\xa7528 is facially overbroad because it applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related services, such an argument must fail.  First, as noted, Milavetz acknowledges that \xc2\xa7528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive bankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one \xe2\x80\x9cset of circumstances exists under which [\xc2\xa7528] would be valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a>, 745 (1987).  Second, Milavetz does not attempt to argue that \xc2\xa7528\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional applications are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d in number when judged in relation to this \xe2\x80\x9cplainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/442/index.html">552 U.
