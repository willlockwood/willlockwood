(part 2) 1425, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13) (Compensation Act).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>James Hilyer, an employee of petitioner Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co., was fatally injured while working on the construction of the District of Columbia Metrorail System.  At the time of his death, Hilyer was covered by the District of Columbia Workmen\'s Compensation Act, D.C.Code \xc2\xa7 36-501 (1973), which incorporates the provisions of the Compensation Act.  He was also a beneficiary of a collective bargaining agreement between Morrison-Knudsen and his union, Local 456 of the Laborers\' District Council of Washington, D.C. and Vicinity (AFL-CIO).</p>\n<p>Immediately upon Hilyer\'s death, petitioner [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] began to pay 66 2/3% of Hilyer\'s "average weekly wage" in death benefits to his wife and two minor children pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 909(b). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Respondent Hilyer disputed the amount of benefits paid, claiming, among other things, that her husband\'s average weekly wage included not only his take-home pay, as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="627">Page 461 U. S. 627</a></p><p> petitioner contended, but also the 68 cents per hour in contributions the employer was required to make to union trust funds under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Administrative Law Judge rejected Mrs. Hilyer\'s contention, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed.  The Board reasoned that only values that are readily identifiable and calculable may be included in the determination of wages.  Hilyer\'s rights in his union trust funds were speculative.  It was not clear from the record whether his pension rights had vested, and even if they had, the value of his interest in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 461 U. S. 628</a></p><p> Pension and Disability Fund depended on his continued employment with petitioner, while the value of his interest in the health, welfare, and training funds was contingent on his need for these benefits.  The Board also rejected the notion that the values could be computed from the amounts contributed by the employer, noting that the family, in all likelihood, would not have been able to purchase similar protection at the same cost.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hilyer [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] sought review of the Benefits Review Board\'s decision in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reiterating her contention that her husband\'s wages included the contributions that his employer made to the union trust funds.

The court reasoned that, since the contributions were intended for the benefit of the workers, the trustees could be viewed as</p>\n<p>"no more than a channel; . . . a means by which the company provides life insurance, health insurance, retirement benefits, and career training for its employees."</p>\n<p><em>Hilyer v. Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co.,</em> 216 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 53, 670 F.2d 208, 211 (1981).  Although the court conceded that the family would not be able to use the employer\'s contribution to purchase benefits of equivalent value, it relied on <em>United States ex rel. Sherman v. Carter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/210/case.html">353 U. S. 210</a></span> (1957), for the proposition that the employer\'s contributions were a reasonable measurement of the value of the benefits to the employees.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 820 (1982), and we reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This case involves the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13), a definitional section that was part of the Compensation Act in 1927, when it became law, and that has remained unchanged through 10 revisions of the Act. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The section provides:</p>\n<p>"\'Wages\' means the money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury, including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer, and gratuities received in the course of employment from others than the employer.  "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 461 U. S. 630</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We begin with the plain language of the Compensation Act.  Since it is undisputed that the employers\' contributions are not "money . . . recompensed" or "gratuities received . . . from others," the narrow question is whether these contributions are a "similar advantage" to "board, rent, housing, [or] lodging."  We hold that they are not.  Board, rent, housing, or lodging are benefits with a present value that can be readily converted into a cash equivalent on the basis of their market values.</p>\n<p>The present value of these trust funds is not, however, so easily converted into a cash equivalent.  Respondent Hilyer urges us to calculate the value by reference to the employer\'s cost of maintaining these funds or to the value of the employee\'s expectation interests in them, but we do not believe that either approach is workable.  The employer\'s cost is irrelevant in this context; it measures neither the employee\'s benefit nor his compensation.  It does not measure the benefit to the employee, because his family could not take the 68 cents per hour earned by Mr. Hilyer to the open market to purchase private policies offering similar benefits to the group policies administered by the union\'s trustees.  It does not measure compensation, because the collective bargaining agreement does not tie petitioner\'s costs to its workers\' labors.  To the contrary, the employee enjoys full advantage of the Training and Health and Welfare Funds as soon as he becomes a beneficiary of the collective bargaining agreement.  App. 37-38 and 40.  He derives benefit from the Pension and Disability Fund according to the "pension credits" he earns.  These pension credits are not correlated to the amount of the employer\'s contribution; the employer pays benefits for every hour the employee works, while the employee earns credits only for the first 1,600 hours of work in a given year.  Furthermore, although the employer is never refunded money that has been contributed, the employee can lose credit if he works less than 200 hours in a year or fails to earn credit for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="631">Page 461 U. S. 631</a></p><p> four years.  Significantly, the employee loses all advantage if he leaves his employment before he attains age 40 and accumulates 10 credits. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 49-68.</p>\n<p>Nor can the value of the funds be measured by the employee\'s expectation interest in them, for that interest is, at best, speculative.  Employees have no voice in the administration of these plans, and thus have no control over the level of funding or the benefits provided.  Furthermore, the value of each fund depends on factors that are unpredictable.  The value to the Hilyer family of the Health and Welfare Fund depends on its need for the services the Fund provides; the value of the Pension and Disability Fund depends on whether Hilyer\'s interest vested, <em>see</em> <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em>  And the value of the Training Fund, which was established to insure "adequate trained manpower," <em>see</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra,</em> and not for the benefit of the individual workers, is even more amorphous.</p>\n<p><em>United States ex rel. Sherman v. Carter, supra,</em> is not to the contrary.  That case concerned a claim under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 270a <em>et seq.,</em> which requires a contractor working for the United States to furnish a surety bond to insure the payment of "sums justly due" employees.  When the employer failed to contribute to the union trust funds as required by the employees\' collective bargaining agreement, the union trustees sued the surety on the bond.  The Court allowed the trustees to maintain their action, reasoning that "contributions were a part of the compensation for the work to be done by [the] employees."  353 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/210/case.html#217">353 U. S. 217</a></span>-218.  The Court did not, however, base its conclusion on the notion these contributions were included in wages.  Indeed the Court specifically noted that the Miller Act "does not limit recovery on the statutory bond to <em>wages.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/210/case.html#217">353 U. S. 217</a></span>.  A far different situation obtains here, where the Compensation Act specifically limits benefits to the worker\'s "wages."  <em>See</em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 461 U. S. 632</a></em></p><p><em> <em>also United States v. Embassy Restaurant, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/29/case.html">359 U.

S. 35</a></span> (1959).\n</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>We are aided in our interpretation of \xc2\xa7 902(13) by the legislative history of the Compensation Act, its structure, and the consistent policies of the agency charged with its enforcement.  That history provides abundant indication that Congress did not intend to include employer contributions to benefit plans within the concept of "wages."</p>\n<p>In 1927, when the Act was enacted, employer-funded fringe benefits were virtually unknown, <em>see</em> United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Beneficial Activities of American Trade-Unions, Bull. No. 465, pp. 3-4 (Sept.1928); <em>cf.</em> S.Rep. No. 963, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1964).  Although the Act was amended several times in the ensuing years, including substantial revision in 1972, there is no evidence in the legislative history indicating that Congress seriously considered the possibility that fringe benefits should be taken into account in determining compensation under the Act. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In comparison, over these same years, Congress has acted on several occasions to include fringe benefits in other statutory schemes, <em>see, e.g.,</em> the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 276a <em>et seq.,</em> which was amended in 1964 to bring the United States\' wage practices "into conformity with modern wage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 461 U. S. 633</a></p><p> payment practices."  S.Rep. No. 963, <em>supra,</em> at 1. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  From this evidence that Congress was aware of the significant changes in compensation practices, its willingness to amend and enact legislation in view of these changes, and its failure to amend the Compensation Act in the same manner, we can only conclude that Congress did not intend this expanded definition of "wages." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The structure of the Act lends further support for our conclusion; it uses the concept of wages in several ways:  to determine disability and survivors\' actual benefits, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 908 and 909, and to calculate the minimum and maximum level of benefits, \xc2\xa7 909(e) (survivors\' benefits), \xc2\xa7 906(b) (disability benefits).  In the latter sense, the reference is to the "national average weekly wage."  Since we have often stated that a word is presumed to have the same meaning in all subsections of the same statute, <em>see Mohasco Corp. v. Silver,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/807/case.html">447 U. S. 807</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/807/case.html#826">447 U. S. 826</a></span> (1980), we would expect the term "wages" to maintain the same meaning throughout the Compensation Act.  Accordingly, were we to accept respondent Hilyer\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="634">Page 461 U. S. 634</a></p><p> argument, we would also have to conclude that in determining the national average weekly wage, the Secretary of Labor is required to evaluate the benefit provisions of collective bargaining agreements throughout the Nation.  Any attempt to make this determination on a national basis would involve deciding which benefits to include, a subject on which different branches of the Government differ, <em>see</em> Chen, The Growth of Fringe Benefits:  Implications for Social Security, 104 Monthly Labor Review 3, 9, n. 6 (Nov.1981). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It would also require deciding how the benefits should be evaluated.  Evaluating benefits is not simple in "defined contribution" plans such as the one involved in this case; in "defined benefit" plans, where the employer\'s costs are actuarially determined to provide a certain level of services, the calculation is infinitely harder.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> the collective bargaining agreement between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers, cited in App. F to Brief for National Council of Self-Insurers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16a.  Without clear indication from Congress that this approach with its attendant problems is required, we decline to adopt it.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that, with the exception of the instant case, the Director of Workers\' Compensation has consistently taken the position that fringe benefits are not includible in wages, <em>see Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director, OWCP,</em> 686 F.2d 1336 (CA9 1982), and letters filed by the Department of Labor in <em>Levis v. Farmers Export Co., appeal pending,</em> No. 81-4258 (CA5), and <em>Waters v. Farmers Export Co.,</em> No. 81-4273 (same).  <em>See also</em> U.S. Dept. of Labor, LS/HW Program Memorandum No. 32, June 17, 1968, reprinted in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 461 U. S. 635</a></p><p> App. to Brief for American Insurance Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1a-4a.  Prior to the Court of Appeals\' decision in this case, the Benefits Review Board had uniformly rejected the argument pressed by respondent Hilyer.  <em>See, e.g., Waters v. Farmers Export Co.,</em> 14 BRBS 102 (1981); <em>Freer v. Duncanson-Harrelson Co.,</em> 9 BRBS 888 (1979), <em>rev\'d in pertinent part and remanded sub nom. Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director, OWCP, supra; Lawson v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Grain Stevedores Co.,</em> 6 BRBS 770 (1977); <em>Collins v. Todd Shipyards Corp.,</em> 5 BRBS 334 (1977).  Although not controlling, the consistent practice of the agencies charged with the enforcement and interpretation of the Act are entitled to deference.  <em>NLRB v. Hendricks County Rural Electric Membership Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/170/case.html">454 U. S. 170</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/170/case.html#189">454 U. S. 189</a></span>-190 (1981); <em>E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

S. 54</a></span>-55 (1977).  We discern nothing to suggest that Congress intended the phrase "wages" as used in \xc2\xa7 902(13) to include employer contributions to fringe benefit plans.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Hilyer argues that, despite these clear indications to the contrary, the remedial policies underlying the Act authorize the agency and require us to expand the meaning of the term to reflect modern employment practices.  It is argued that fringe benefits are advantageous to both the worker, who receives tax-free benefits that he otherwise would have to buy with after-tax dollars, and to the employer, who reduces payroll costs by providing his workers with services that they could not on their own purchase with equivalent dollars.  Respondent Hilyer contends that the incentive to trade salary for benefits should not be diluted by failing to consider the value of the benefits in determining survivorship and disability rights.</p>\n<p>There is force to this argument, but a comprehensive statute such as this Act is not to be judicially expanded because of "recent trends."  <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v.

There we recognized that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 461 U. S. 636</a></p><p> the Act was not a simple remedial statute intended for the benefit of the workers.  Rather, it was designed to strike a balance between the concerns of the longshoremen and harbor workers on the one hand, and their employers on the other.  Employers relinquished their defenses to tort actions in exchange for limited and predictable liability.  Employees accept the limited recovery because they receive prompt relief without the expense, uncertainty, and delay that tort actions entail.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/268/case.html#282">449 U.

No. 92-1125, p. 5 (1972).</p>\n<p>Against this background, reinterpretation of the term "wages" would significantly alter the balance achieved by Congress.  As noted above, employer-funded benefits were virtually unknown in 1927; as a result, employers have long calculated their compensation costs on the basis of their cash payroll.  Since 1927, however, the proportion of costs attributable to fringe benefits has increased significantly.  In 1950, these benefits constituted only 5% of compensation costs; their value increased to 10% by 1970, and is over 15% presently.  Chen, <em>supra,</em> at 5. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  According to some projections, they could easily constitute more than one-third of labor costs by the middle of the next century, <em>ibid.</em>  This shift in the relative value of take-home pay versus fringe benefits dramatically alters the cost factors upon which employers and their insurers have relied in ordering their affairs.  If these reasonable expectations are to be altered, that is a task for Congress, <em>J. W. Bateson Co. v. United States ex rel.

S. 637</a></p><p> and their survivors.  Under the Act as presently interpreted, more than 95% of all lost-time injuries are immediately compensated without recourse to the administrative process.  In all but 0.1% of the cases, delays averaged less than 10 months.

In no event, however, is the amount payable to exceed 66 2/3% of such wages.  The statute also establishes a minimum level of death benefits by providing that "the average weekly wages of the deceased shall be considered to have been not less than the applicable national average weekly wage" as determined by the Secretary of Labor, \xc2\xa7 909(e), so long as benefits do not exceed the deceased\'s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In relevant part, that agreement provides:</p>\n<p>"Section 5.

That Office has, however, since readopted its prior understanding that the term "wages" does not include employer contributions to union trust funds.  <em>See, e.g., Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director, OWCP,</em> 686 F.2d 1336, 1343 (CA9 1982).  Accordingly, before this Court, the federal respondent has taken a position in support of the petitioner.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hilyer also disputed the manner in which the employer had accounted for the fact that Hilyer had worked for Morrison-Knudsen for only part of the year, and had worked for substantially lower wages for the remainder of the year.  The employer contended that the average weekly wages should be calculated on the basis of Hilyer\'s actual wages; Mrs. Hilyer claimed that, under 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 910(b), his wages should be determined by reference to the wages of a fellow employee "of the same class" who had worked "substantially the whole" of the preceding year.  The Benefits Review Board upheld a determination by the Administrative Law Judge in Mrs. Hilyer\'s favor, but modified the amount of attorney\'s fees awarded under 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 928.  The employer\'s and insurer\'s cross-appeal from that determination was consolidated by the Court of Appeals with Mrs. Hilyer\'s appeal of the Board\'s adverse determination on the definition of wages.  The court affirmed the decision of the Board to modify the attorney\'s fees award, but did not address the \xc2\xa7 910(b) issue.  Petitioner did not seek review of the determination on either the attorney\'s fees issue or the \xc2\xa7 910(b) issue.  Accordingly, neither determination is before us.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The statute was amended in 1934, 1938, 1948, 1956, 1960, 1961, and 1969 to revise or increase benefits.  It was amended in 1958 to require employers to maintain a reasonably safe workplace.  In 1959, it was amended to allow certain third-party actions.  In 1972, the Act was comprehensively revised.  <em>See</em> S.Rep.

S.Rep. No. 92-1125, p. 4 (1972).  This figure apparently comes from earnings statistics provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <em>see</em> United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Handbook of Labor Statistics 1978, p. 321 (1979) (listing data from 1972).

Her argument appears to imply, however, that every benefit of her husband\'s employment should be evaluated to determine his wages.  This would seem to require the Secretary of Labor to include in his determination of the national average weekly wage such diverse elements as employer contributions to Social Security, administrative costs of maintaining savings and thrift plans, and the costs of Christmas parties, company outings, or gold watches.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also</em> Handbook of Labor Statistics, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, at 388-393.

This argument is not well taken in the context of survivor benefits; upon the death of the worker, disability, pension, and training benefits have no relevance.  Furthermore, under respondent Hilyer\'s interpretation of the statute, she would be entitled to a death benefit (had her husband\'s interest in his pension plan vested) as well as the funds necessary to purchase the benefit she has just received.  We do not think Congress could have intended to provide this double "recovery."  While it is true that, once the worker\'s employment ends, his survivors will be forced to provide for their own health insurance, we do not believe that a statute as complex as this one should be interpreted in light of this single factor.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.</p>\n<p>On April 19, 1974, James H. Hilyer was run over by a cement truck while working for petitioner Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co.  The dispute in this case concerns the calculation of the level of death benefits that should be paid to his widow and their two children.  The appropriate level of benefits depends on the meaning of the term "wages" under \xc2\xa7 2(13) of the Longshoremen\'s and Harbor Workers\' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13).  The Court of Appeals held that "wages" include employer contributions to union trust funds for health and welfare, pensions, and training.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, Congress enacted the pertinent statutory language in 1927.  "Wages" were defined as</p>\n<p>"the money rate at which the service . . . is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury, including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer."</p>\n<p>Act of Mar. 4, 1927, \xc2\xa7 2(13), 44 Stat. (part 2) 1425.  The question presented is whether payments made by an employer to union trust funds for the benefit of employees, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, should be deemed "wages" under the Act.  As the majority notes, when the Act became law in 1927, employer-funded fringe benefits were "virtually unknown."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#632">461 U.

S. 640</a></p><p> so as to carry out the congressional purpose underlying the Act.</p>\n<p>The 1927 Longshoremen\'s Act was a direct response to decisions of this Court which limited the authority of the States to apply their workers\' compensation laws to injured maritime workers.  <em>See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/205/case.html">244 U. S. 205</a></span> (1917); <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. v.

In order to fill the void created by those decisions, Congress adopted a federal compensation scheme patterned after existing state workers\' compensation laws.  S.Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 16 (1926); H.R.Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., 20 (1927).  In particular, the 1927 Act was derived from the New York State workers\' compensation law, which was deemed one of the most progressive in the country.  <em>See ibid.;</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1190, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1926).  The definition of "wages" incorporated in the 1927 Act was lifted almost verbatim from the New York statute.  <em>Compare</em> 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13) <em>with</em> N.Y.Work.Comp.Law \xc2\xa7 201.12 (McKinney 1965).</p>\n<p>When Congress acted, the recognized aim of the New York workers\' compensation scheme was to compensate for "<em>the loss of earning power</em> incurred in the common enterprise, irrespective of the question of negligence."  <em>New York Central R. Co. v. White,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/243/188/case.html">243 U.

In describing the New York law on which the federal scheme was modeled, the New York Court of Appeals had stated:</p>\n<p>"[C]ompensation awarded the employee is not such as is recoverable under the rules of damages applicable in actions founded upon negligence.  <em>It is based on loss of earning power. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Winfield v. New York C. &amp; H.R. R. Co.,</em> 216 N.Y. 284, 289, 110 N.E. 614, 616 (1915) (emphasis added).  <em>Accord, Marhoffer v. Marhoffer,</em> 220 N.Y. 543, 547, 116 N.E. 379, 380 (1917) ("The award is to compensate for loss of earning power").  The Longshoremen\'s Act, like the New York law, thus focused on an employee\'s loss of earning capacity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="641">Page 461 U. S. 641</a></p><p> as a result of an occupational injury.  <em>See</em> Act of Mar. 4, 1927, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(c)(21), (e), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 10(c), (d), 44 Stat. (part 2) 1428, 1429, 1431; <em>Vogler v. Ontario Knife Co.,</em> 223 App.Div. 550, 229 N.Y.S. 5 (1928); <em>Berenowski v. Anchor Window Cleaning Co.,</em> 221 App.Div. 155, 223 N.Y.S. 73 (1927).</p>\n<p>Viewed against this background, the term "wages" as used in the 1927 Act should encompass employer-funded benefits, because those benefits indisputably represent a portion of the employee\'s earning power.  Union members with various benefits that they have collectively bargained for clearly have a greater earning capacity than employees with equal take-home pay but without such benefits.  For the purposes of determining a worker\'s earning power, there is no principled distinction between direct cash payments and payments into a plan that provides benefits to the employee.  If the employer had agreed to pay some fixed amount of money to its employees who, in turn, paid the amount into benefit funds, that amount would satisfy the majority\'s definition of wages, since the benefit has "a present value that can be readily converted into a cash equivalent on the basis of [its] market valu[e]."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#630">461 U. S. 630</a></span>.  In my view, the result should not change simply because the company agrees to eliminate an unnecessary transaction by paying the contributions directly to the trust funds.  Employees may bargain to receive their compensation strictly in cash payments or may arrange to forgo a portion of those payments in exchange for certain fringe benefits.  There is no reasoned basis for concluding that the employee\'s earning power should differ depending on which arrangement is chosen.</p>\n<p>Fringe benefits now constitute over 15% of employers\' compensation costs, and they could easily constitute more than one-third of labor costs by the middle of the next century.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#636">461 U. S. 636</a></span>.  Such benefits are provided in exchange for labor and as a result of bargained agreements.  In 1927, Congress explicitly included within the meaning of "wages" the reasonable value of "board, rent, housing, [and] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="642">Page 461 U. S. 642</a></p><p> lodging."  At the time, these items were the known noncash components of an employee\'s earning power.  In terms of a modern employee\'s earning power, fringe benefits are functionally equivalent, and should be treated in the same manner. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority\'s initial objection to including employee benefits within the meaning of "wages" involves the problem of valuation.  In this case, the employer\'s contributions to the funds under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are readily identifiable:  they amount to 68 cents per hour per employee.  Yet the majority rejects such a measure, asserting that the employer\'s cost is "irrelevant in this context."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#630">461 U. S. 630</a></span>.  I disagree.  In my view, it is better to be roughly right than totally wrong.  The trust funds obviously have some value for employees, and simply to exclude them from consideration is hardly an appropriate response to uncertainty about their precise value.  In addition, the statute itself calls only for inclusion of "the <em>reasonable</em> value" of noncash items, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13) (emphasis added).  While </p><p><a class="page-number" name="643">Page 461 U. S. 643</a></p><p> an employer\'s contribution may understate the true value of the benefits received under the collective bargaining agreement, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] it nonetheless provides a readily identifiable, and therefore reasonable, surrogate for the "advantage" received.  An employer\'s contribution to a trust fund has long been accepted as a reasonable measure of the value of fringe benefits when such benefits are expressly included in a statutory definition of wages.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 276a <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>The majority also relies heavily on Congress\' "failure to amend" the Longshoremen\'s Act to provide specifically that fringe benefits constitute wages.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#633">461 U. S. 633</a></span>.  Inferring Congress\' intent from legislative silence is never an easy task.  Such inferences are reasonable only under special circumstances, such as where a well-established agency or judicial statutory construction has been brought to the attention of the Congress, and the Legislature has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects.  <em>United States v. Rutherford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/544/case.html">442 U.

In this case, there is no evidence that the administrative construction of the term "wages" has been brought to Congress\' attention.  Similarly, until the decision below, the term "wages" in the Longshoremen\'s Act had never been judicially defined to include or exclude fringe benefits.  And the majority apparently concedes that Congress did not even consider the fringe benefit issue during its consideration of the 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\'s Act.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#632">461 U. S. 632</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="644">Page 461 U. S. 644</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The majority emphasizes that "Congress has acted on several occasions to include fringe benefits in <em>other</em> statutory schemes."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The Court points to the Davis-Bacon Act, which historically contained <em>no</em> definition of the terms "wages," [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] but which was amended in 1964 to provide a definition of the term that included fringe benefits.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#632">461 U. S. 632</a></span>-633.  The majority then states that, in light of Congress\' willingness to amend some legislation, but not the Longshoremen\'s Act, "we can only conclude that Congress did not intend this expanded definition of <em>wages.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#633">461 U. S. 633</a></span>.  However, the term "wage" or "wages" is used in over 1,200 separate subsections of the United States Code.  That Congress has revised the meaning of the term in a few of these provisions hardly controls the meaning of the term in the vast number of other subsections.  The notion that Congress has systematically examined existing legislation and amended definitional sections wherever appropriate is sheer fiction.  The majority also points to the "consistent" practices of the agencies charged with interpreting the Act.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#635">461 U. S. 635</a></span>.  The force of this argument is diminished in this case by at least two considerations.  First, fringe benefits have only recently begun to represent an appreciable portion of wages.  It is for this reason that the meaning of the term "wages" has become a serious administrative issue only in the past few years.  For example, the first decision of the Benefits Review Board that addressed the issue of fringe benefits was rendered only six years ago.  <em>See Collins v. Todd Shipyards Corp.,</em> 5 BRBS 334 (1977).  This case therefore does not present a situation where an agency\'s longstanding interpretation of a statute deserves "great weight," <em>cf. NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html">416 U. S. 267</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/267/case.html#275">416 U. S. 275</a></span> (1974), and it certainly does not involve a contemporaneous construction of a statute, <em>cf. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/46/case.html">432 U. S. 46</a></span>, </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="645">Page 461 U.

Second, in this very case, the Director of the Office of Workers\' Compensation submitted a lengthy brief in the Court of Appeals contending that the Benefits Review Board had "clearly erred" when it excluded the employer\'s contributions to the union trust funds in computing the decedent\'s wages.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 80-1504 (CADC), p. 9.  The Director has now switched sides.  Of course, agencies often make mistakes and disavow prior positions, but a call for deference to administrative expertise under these circumstances has a rather hollow ring.\n</em></p>\n<p>Finally, the majority contends that a change in the manner of calculating wages could "drastically" undermine the goal of prompt compensation of injured workers and their survivors.  <em>Ante</em> at 637. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  This concern is unfounded.  As we have previously noted, the Longshoremen\'s Act</p>\n<p>"requires the employer to begin making the payments called for by the Act within 14 days after receiving notice of injury without awaiting resolution of the compensation claim and permits withholding of payments only to the extent of any dispute."</p>\n<p><em>Intercounty Construction Corp. v. Walter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/1/case.html">422 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/1/case.html#4">422 U. S. 4</a></span> n. 4 (1975) citing \xc2\xa7 14 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 914.  Nor would compensation for employer-funded benefits lead to increased litigation under the Act.  As long as fringe benefits are valued at some reasonable amount, the marginal increase in compensation to be gained by challenging the calculation of "wages" will almost certainly be small enough not to warrant resort to the administrative process.  In any event, as the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="646">Page 461 U. S. 646</a></p><p> majority recognizes, such employer contributions are already included within a whole host of statutes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#632">461 U. S. 632</a></span>-633, and n. 9, yet there is no evidence to suggest that those provisions are administratively cumbersome. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Notably, the Davis-Bacon Act, which covers virtually all construction projects to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party, applied to the very project on which Mr. Hilyer was working at the time of his death.  That Act requires, <em>inter alia,</em> that all contractors and subcontractors make payments in accordance with prevailing wage determinations made by the Secretary of Labor, and requires contractors to post a scale of wages at the site of work.  40 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 276a(a).  All wage determinations must include fringe benefits, \xc2\xa7 276a(b), and the statute has been administered smoothly in this fashion for nearly 20 years.  Thus, in this case, an accepted measure of the deceased\'s wages -- including employer contributions -- was readily available.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Shortly after the Longshoremen\'s Act became law, this Court stressed that it "should be construed liberally in furtherance of [its] purpose . . . and, if possible, so as to avoid incongruous or harsh results."  <em>Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Steamboat Co. v. Norton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/408/case.html">284 U. S. 408</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/408/case.html#414">284 U. S. 414</a></span> (1932).  In my </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 461 U. S. 647</a></p><p> view, it would be incongruous to allow an employee\'s fringe benefits to rise without any corresponding protection in the event of injury or death, and harsh simply to ignore part of an employee\'s earning power when calculating benefits for his survivors.  Because the majority\'s narrow construction of the term "wages" is fundamentally at odds with Congress\' purpose in enacting the compensation scheme, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Hilyer v. Morrison-Knudsen Contracting Co.,</em> 216 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 670 F.2d 208 (1981).  The only other Court of Appeals to address this question has reached the same conclusion. <em>Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director, OWCP,</em> 686 F.2d 1336 (CA9 1982).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, a statute enacted in 1880 before the invention of the automobile might well have applied to "carriages."  Suppose that the statute requires all "carriages" to come to a stop before entering a crosswalk near a schoolyard.  If the statutory purpose is to assure safety, a court should apply the statute to automobiles.  On the other hand, suppose the statute provides that no "carriage" above a certain weight shall be used on a public road unless it is being drawn by at least two horses.  If the statutory purpose is to assure that horses are not subject to too great a strain, it obviously follows that the law should not be applied to automobiles.  The language of the enactment must be interpreted in light of its purposes.  <em>See</em> 2 H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process:  Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1214-1215 (Tent. ed.1958).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority suggests that the standard of living of an injured worker\'s family might not decline in the event that the worker is fatally injured.  "[U]pon the death of the worker, disability, pension, and training benefits have no relevance."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#637">461 U. S. 637</a></span>, n. 14.  Of course, deceased workers also have no need for employer-provided room or board, but the reasonable value of such benefits is nonetheless included in the calculation of the employee\'s wages under the Longshoremen\'s Act.  Indeed, none of the normal living expenses that must be provided from the worker\'s take-home pay continue to be required after a worker dies.  This is obviously no reason for ignoring such pay in the calculation of wages.  The point here is that all of these elements constitute the basis for the employee\'s earning power at the time of injury, and, for that reason, all of these elements should be included in the calculation of "wages."  (It should also be remembered that survivors of a deceased employee may receive no more than two-thirds of the employee\'s "wages," 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 909(b), so there is little danger that their standard of living will improve significantly.)</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#629">461 U.

Of course, this problem already arises with respect to benefits explicitly included under the Act such as "board."  For example, an employer may contribute to a fund that provides free meals to its employees.  If only because of economies of scale associated with feeding large numbers of employees, the employer\'s contribution would undoubtedly be less than the price required for employees individually to purchase similar meals on the open market.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Act of Mar. 3, 1931, ch. 411, \xc2\xa7 1, 46 Stat. 1494; Act of Aug. 30, 1935, 49 Stat. 1011; Act of June 15, 1940, ch. 373, \xc2\xa7 1, 54 Stat. 399; Act of July 12, 1960, \xc2\xa7 26, 74 Stat. 418.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority hints at problems that would be caused by including in the calculation of wages "the costs of Christmas parties, company outings, or gold watches."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/624/case.html#634">461 U.

The simple answer is that the statute\'s express reference to recompense "under the contract of hiring" in force at the time of the injury, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 902(13), suggests that the collective bargaining agreement would provide a simple guide as to which fringe benefits to include in the calculation of wages.  In any event, the Secretary of Labor has expressed no problems in calculating wages under those statutes which do require inclusion of fringe benefits.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Inclusion of fringe benefits in the compensation calculations has proved quite feasible in such diverse contexts as the Federal Employees Compensation Act, <em>see</em> 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 8101(12); <em>United States v.

General Dynamics Corp.,</em> 5 BRBS 579 (1977), meals furnished employees, <em>see Harris v. Lambros,</em> 61 App.D.C. 16, 56 F.2d 488 (1932), and such exotic items as automobile parts, <em>Carter v.
