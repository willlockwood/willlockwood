The process consists of using any test (whether patented or unpatented) to measure the level in a body fluid of an amino acid called homocysteine and then noticing whether its level is elevated above the norm; if so, a vitamin deficiency is likely.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lower courts held that the patent claim is valid.  They also found the petitioner, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp), liable for inducing infringement of the claim when it encouraged doctors to order diagnostic tests for measuring homocysteine.  The courts assessed damages.  And they enjoined LabCorp from using any tests that would lead the doctors it serves to find a vitamin deficiency by taking account of elevated homocysteine levels.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the patent claim is invalid on the ground that it improperly seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cclaim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d Pet. for Cert. i, namely, the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency.  The Court has dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.  In my view, we should not dismiss the writ.  The question presented is not unusually difficult.  We have the authority to decide it.  We said that we would do so.  The parties and <em>amici</em> have fully briefed the question.  And those who engage in medical research, who practice medicine, and who as patients depend upon proper health care, might well benefit from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative answer.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant principle of law \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xclude[s] from \xe2\x80\xa6 patent protection \xe2\x80\xa6 laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Diehr,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/175/index.html"></a><a href="/us/450/175/index.html">450 U. S. 175</a>, 185 (1981).  This principle finds its roots in both English and American law. See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Neilson</em> v. <em>Harford</em>, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841); <em>Le Roy</em> v. <em>Tatham,</em> 14 How. 156. 175 (1853); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly</em> v. <em>Morse</em>, 15 How. 62 (1854); <em>The Telephone Cases,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/126/1/index.html">126 U.

The principle means that Einstein could not have \xe2\x80\x9cpatent[ed] his celebrated law that E=mc<font super="1">2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Chakrabarty</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/303/index.html">447 U.

To the contrary, research into such matters may be costly and time-consuming; monetary incentives may matter; and the fruits of those incentives and that research may prove of great benefit to the human race.  Rather, the reason for the exclusion is that sometimes <em>too much </em>patent protection can impede rather than \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\xe2\x80\x9d the constitutional objective of patent and copyright protection.  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem arises from the fact that patents do not only encourage research by providing monetary incentives for invention.  Sometimes their presence can discourage research by impeding the free exchange of information, for example by forcing researchers to avoid the use of potentially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing or pending patents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by raising the costs of using the patented information, sometimes prohibitively so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Patent law seeks to avoid the dangers of overprotection just as surely as it seeks to avoid the diminished incentive to invent that underprotection can threaten.  One way in which patent law seeks to sail between these opposing and risky shoals is through rules that bring certain types of invention and discovery within the scope of patentability while excluding others.  And scholars have noted that \xe2\x80\x9cpatent law[\xe2\x80\x99s] exclu[sion of] fundamental scientific (including mathematical) and technological principles,\xe2\x80\x9d (like copyright\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cideas\xe2\x80\x9d) is a rule of the latter variety.  W. Landes &amp; R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 305 (2003).  That rule reflects \xe2\x80\x9cboth . . . the enormous potential for rent seeking that would be created if property rights could be obtained in [those basic principles] and . . .  the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed on would-be users.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 305\xe2\x80\x93306; cf. <em>Nichols</em> v.<em> Universal Pictures Corp.</em>, 45 F.\xc2\xa02d 119, 122 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are \xe2\x80\xa6 the basic tools of scientific and technological work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gottschalk</em> v. <em>Benson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/index.html"></a><a href="/us/409/63/index.html">409 U. S. 63</a>, 67 (1972).  It has treated fundamental scientific principles as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the storehouse of knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d and manifestations of laws of nature as \xe2\x80\x9cfree to all men and reserved exclusively to none.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Funk Bros.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 130.  And its doing so reflects a basic judgment that protection in such cases, despite its potentially positive incentive effects, would too often severely interfere with, or discourage, development and the further spread of useful knowledge itself.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 1980s three university doctors, after conducting research into vitamin deficiencies, found a correlation between high levels of homocysteine in the blood and deficiencies of two essential vitamins, folate (folic acid) and cobalamin (vitamin B<font super="-1">12).  They also developed more accurate methods for testing body fluids for homocysteine, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.  They published their findings in 1985.  They obtained a patent.  And that patent eventually found its commercial way into the hands of Competitive Technologies, Inc. (CTI), and its licensee Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. (Metabolite), the respondents here.</font></p><font super="-1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The patent contains several claims that cover the researchers\xe2\x80\x99 new methods for testing homocysteine levels using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.  Supp. App. 30.  In 1991, LabCorp (in fact, a corporate predecessor) took a license from Metabolite permitting it to use the tests described in the patent in return for 27.5% of related revenues.  Their agreement permitted LabCorp to terminate the arrangement if \xe2\x80\x9ca more cost effective commercial alternative is available <em>that does not infringe a valid and enforceable claim</em> of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the patent.  App. 305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until 1998, LabCorp used the patented tests and paid royalties.  By that time, however, growing recognition that elevated homocysteine levels might predict risk of heart disease led to increased testing demand.  Other companies began to produce alternative testing procedures.  And LabCorp decided to use one of these other procedures\xe2\x80\x94a test devised by Abbott Laboratories that LabCorp concluded was \xe2\x80\x9cfar superior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 167 (testimony of Peter Wentz).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0LabCorp continued to pay royalties to respondents whenever it used the patented tests.  But it concluded that Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s test did not fall within the patent\xe2\x80\x99s protective scope.  And LabCorp consequently refused to pay royalties when it used the Abbott test.  <em>Id.,</em> at 237 (payment eliminated due to \xe2\x80\x9cchange in methodology\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 respondents brought this suit against LabCorp for patent infringement and breach of the license agreement.  They did not claim that LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Abbott test infringed the patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims describing methods for testing for homocysteine.  Instead, respondents relied on a broader claim not limited to those tests, namely claim 13, the sole claim at issue here.  That claim\xe2\x80\x94set forth below in its entirety\xe2\x80\x94seeks patent protection for:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA method for detecting a deficiency of cobalamin or folate in warm-blooded animals comprising the steps of:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cassaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total homocysteine; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9ccorrelating an elevated level of total homocysteine in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or folate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 30.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Claim 13, respondents argued, created a protected monopoly over the process of \xe2\x80\x9ccorrelating\xe2\x80\x9d test results and potential vitamin deficiencies.  The parties agreed that the words \xe2\x80\x9cassaying a body fluid\xe2\x80\x9d refer to the use of any test at all, whether patented or not patented, that determines whether a body fluid has an \xe2\x80\x9celevated level of total homocysteine.\xe2\x80\x9d  And at trial, the inventors testified that claim 13\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccorrelating\xe2\x80\x9d step consists simply of a physician\xe2\x80\x99s recognizing that a test that shows an elevated homocysteine level\xe2\x80\x94by that very fact\xe2\x80\x94shows the patient likely has a cobalamin or folate deficiency.  App. 108\xe2\x80\x93111 (testimony of Dr. Sally Stabler); <em>id.,</em> at 131\xe2\x80\x93148 (testimony of Robert Allen).  They added that, because the natural relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency was now well known, such \xe2\x80\x9ccorrelating\xe2\x80\x9d would occur automatically in the mind of any competent physician.  <em>Id.,</em> at 137\xe2\x80\x93138 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this understanding of the claim, respondents argued, LabCorp was liable for inducing doctors to infringe.  More specifically, LabCorp would conduct homocysteine tests and report the results measured in micromoles (millionths of a mole) per liter (symbolized mol/L).  Doctors, because of their training, would know that a normal homocysteine range in blood is between 7 and 22 mol/L (and in urine between 1 and 20 mol/L), Supp.\xc2\xa0App. 14, and would know that an elevated homocysteine level is correlated with a vitamin deficiency.  Hence, in reviewing the test results, doctors would look at the mol/L measure and automatically reach a conclusion about whether or not a person was suffering from a vitamin deficiency.  Claim 13 therefore covered <em>every</em> homocysteine test that a doctor reviewed.  And since LabCorp had advertised its tests and educated doctors about the correlation, LabCorp should be liable for actively inducing the doctors\xe2\x80\x99 infringing acts.  See 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found LabCorp liable on this theory.  The District Court calculated damages based on unpaid royalties for some 350,000 homocysteine tests performed by LabCorp using the Abbott method.  The court also enjoined LabCorp from performing \xe2\x80\x9cany homocysteine-only test, including, without limitation homocysteine-only tests via the Abbott method.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a\xe2\x80\x9337a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0LabCorp appealed.  It argued to the Federal Circuit that the trial court was wrong to construe claim 13 so broadly that infringement took place \xe2\x80\x9cevery time a physician does nothing more than look at a patient\xe2\x80\x99s homocysteine level.\xe2\x80\x9d  Corrected Brief for Appellant in No. 03\xe2\x80\x931120 (CA Fed.), p.\xc2\xa028 (hereinafter Brief for Appellant).  Indeed, if so construed (rather than construed, say, to cover only <em>patented </em>tests), then claim 13 was \xe2\x80\x9cinvalid for indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement, anticipation,\nand obviousness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 38.  LabCorp told the Federal\nCircuit:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Court were to uphold this vague claim, anyone could obtain a patent on any scientific correlation\xe2\x80\x94that there is a link between fact A and fact B\xe2\x80\x94merely by drafting a patent claiming no more than \xe2\x80\x98test for fact A and correlate with fact B\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Claim 13 does no more than that.  If it is upheld, CTI would improperly gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact rather than any novel invention of its own.  The law is settled that no such claim should be allowed.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Diamond</em> v. <em>Diehr,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/175/index.html"></a><a href="/us/450/175/index.html">450 U. S. 175</a> (1981); \xe2\x80\xa6 Chisum on Patents \xc2\xa71.03[6].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 41.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit rejected LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s arguments.  It agreed with the District Court that claim 13\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccorrelating\xe2\x80\x9d step simply means \xe2\x80\x9crelating total homocysteine levels to cobalamin or folate deficiency, a deficiency in both, or a deficiency in neither.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 F.\xc2\xa03d 1354, 1363 (2004).  That meaning, it said, is \xe2\x80\x9cdiscernable and clear\xe2\x80\x9d; it is definite, it is described in writing, and it would enable virtually anyone to follow the instruction it gives.  And that is sufficient.  <em>Id</em>., at 1366\xe2\x80\x931367.  The Court did not address LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, <em>if so construed</em>, claim 13 must be struck down as an improper effort to obtain patent protection for a law of nature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Circuit concluded, because any competent doctor reviewing test results would automatically correlate those results with the presence or absence of a vitamin deficiency, virtually every doctor who ordered and read the tests was a direct infringer.  And because LabCorp \xe2\x80\x9cpublishes \xe2\x80\xa6 Continuing Medical Education articles\xe2\x80\x9d and other pieces, which urge doctors to conduct the relevant tests and to reach a conclusion about whether a patient is suffering from a vitamin deficiency based upon the test results, LabCorp induces infringement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1365.  Finally, the court rejected LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the injunction.  <em>Id</em>., at 1372.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0LabCorp filed a petition for certiorari.  Question Three of the petition asks \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether a method patent \xe2\x80\xa6 directing a party simply to \xe2\x80\x98correlate\xe2\x80\x99 test results can validly claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship \xe2\x80\xa6 such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  After calling for and receiving the views of the Solicitor General, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1185/index.html">543 U. S. 1185</a> (2005), we granted the petition, limited to Question Three.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether claim 13, as construed and applied in the way I have described in Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, is invalid in light of the \xe2\x80\x9claw of nature\xe2\x80\x9d principle, described in Part I\xe2\x80\x93A.  I believe that we should answer that question.  There is a technical procedural reason for not doing so, namely, that LabCorp did not refer in the lower courts to \xc2\xa7101 of the Patent Act, which sets forth subject matter that is patentable, and within the bounds of which the \xe2\x80\x9claw of nature\xe2\x80\x9d principle most comfortably fits.  See 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 (patent may be obtained for \xe2\x80\x9cany new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Flook,</em> 437 U. S., at 588\xe2\x80\x93589.  There is also a practical reason for not doing so, namely, that we might benefit from the views of the Federal Circuit, which did not directly consider the question.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bestfoods,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/51/index.html">524 U. S. 51</a>, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, stronger considerations argue for our reaching a decision.  For one thing, the technical procedural objection is tenuous.  LabCorp argued the essence of its present claim below.  It told the Federal Circuit that claim 13 as construed by the District Court was too \xe2\x80\x9cvague\xe2\x80\x9d because that construction would allow \xe2\x80\x9canyone\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cobtain a patent on any scientific correlation;\xe2\x80\x9d it would permit the respondents \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly [to] gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact\xe2\x80\x9d despite \xe2\x80\x9csettled\xe2\x80\x9d law \xe2\x80\x9cthat no such claim should be allowed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant 41 (citing <em>Diehr,</em> 450 U. S., at 1185; 1\xc2\xa0D. Chisum, Patents \xc2\xa71.03[6]) (2006 ed.) (hereinafter Chisum).  LabCorp explicitly stated in its petition for certiorari that, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Court allows the Federal Circuit opinion to stand \xe2\x80\xa6 [respondents] would improperly gain monopolies over basic scientific facts rather than any novel inventions of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 25 (citing <em>Diehr</em>, <em>supra; Gottschalk,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/63/index.html"></a><a href="/us/409/63/index.html">409 U.

And after considering the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s advice not to hear the case (primarily based upon LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s failure to refer to 35 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101), we rejected that advice, thereby \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily consider[ing] and reject[ing] that contention as a basis for denying review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/36/index.html">504 U. S. 36</a>, 40 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, I can find no good practical reason for refusing to decide the case.  The relevant issue has been fully briefed and argued by the parties, the Government, and 20 <em>amici</em>.  The record is comprehensive, allowing us to learn the precise nature of the patent claim, to consider the commercial and medical context (which the parties and <em>amici</em> have described in detail), and to become familiar with the arguments made in all courts.  Neither\nthe factual record nor the briefing suffers from any\nsignificant gap.  No party has identified any prejudice due to our answering the question.  And there is no indication that LabCorp\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cite \xc2\xa7101 reflected unfair gamesmanship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, further consideration by the Federal Circuit might help us reach a better decision.  Lower court consideration almost always helps.  But the thoroughness of the briefing leads me to conclude that the extra time, cost, and uncertainty that further proceedings would engender are not worth the potential benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I believe that important considerations of the public interest\xe2\x80\x94including that of clarifying the law in this area sooner rather than later\xe2\x80\x94argue strongly for our deciding the question presented now.  See Part IV, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn to the merits.  The researchers who obtained the present patent found that an elevated level of homocysteine in a warm-blooded animal is correlated with folate and cobalamin deficiencies.  As construed by the Federal Circuit, claim 13 provides those researchers with control over doctors\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to use that correlation to diagnose vitamin deficiencies in a patient.  Does the law permit such protection or does claim 13, in the circumstances, amount to an invalid effort to patent a \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenon of nature\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concede that the category of non-patentable \xe2\x80\x9cphenomena of nature,\xe2\x80\x9d like the categories of \xe2\x80\x9cmental processes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabstract intellectual concepts,\xe2\x80\x9d is not easy to define.

After all, many a patentable invention rests upon its inventor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of natural phenomena; many \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d patents seek to make abstract intellectual concepts workably concrete; and all conscious human action involves a mental process.  See generally 1 Chisum \xc2\xa71.03, at 78\xe2\x80\x93295.  Nor can one easily use such abstract categories directly to distinguish instances of likely beneficial, from likely harmful, forms of protection.  Cf.

It does not require us to consider the precise scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural phenomenon\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine or any other difficult issue.  In my view, claim 13 is invalid no matter how narrowly one reasonably interprets that doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There can be little doubt that the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency set forth in claim 13 is a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is what the petitioners argue.  It is what the Solicitor General has told us.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19 (filed Dec. 23, 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe natural relationship between elevated homocysteine and deficiencies in the B vitamins is an unpatentable \xe2\x80\x98principle in natural philosophy or physical science\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) (quoting <em>Morse</em>, 15 How., at 116)).  Indeed, it is close to what the respondents concede.  Brief for Respondents 31 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe correlation between total homocysteine and deficiencies in cobalamin and folate that the Inventors discovered could be considered, standing alone, a \xe2\x80\x98natural phenomenon\xe2\x80\x99 in the literal sense: It is an observable aspect of biochemistry in at least some human populations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The respondents argue, however, that the correlation is nonetheless patentable because claim 13 packages it in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d for detecting vitamin deficiency, with discrete testing and correlating steps.  They point to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements that a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Flook</em>, 437 U. S., at 590; see also <em>Gottschalk</em>, 409 U. S., at 67, and that \xe2\x80\x9can <em>application </em>of a law of nature \xe2\x80\xa6 to a known \xe2\x80\xa6 process may well be deserving of patent protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Diehr, </em>450 U. S.,<em> </em>at 187<em>.  </em>They add that claim 13 is a patentable \xe2\x80\x9capplication of a law of nature\xe2\x80\x9d because, considered as a whole, it (1) \xe2\x80\x9centails a physical transformation of matter,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the alteration of a blood sample during whatever test is used, Brief for Respondents 33 (citing <em>Cochrane</em> v. <em>Deener,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/94/780/index.html">94 U. S. 780</a>, 788 (1877);<em> Gottschalk, supra,</em> at 70), and because it (2) \xe2\x80\x9cproduces a \xe2\x80\x98useful, concrete, and tangible result,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d namely, detection of a vitamin deficiency, Brief for Respondents 36 (citing <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v.<em> Signature Financial Group, Inc.</em>, 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed 1998)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, however, the cases to which respondents refer do not support their claim.  Neither <em>Cochrane </em>nor <em>Gottschalk</em> can help them because the process described in claim 13 is <em>not </em>a process for transforming blood or any other matter.  Claim 13\xe2\x80\x99s process instructs the user to (1) obtain test results and (2) think about them.  Why should it matter if the test results themselves were obtained through an unpatented procedure that involved the transformation of blood?  Claim 13 is indifferent to that fact, for it tells the user to use any test at all.  Indeed, to use virtually any natural phenomenon for virtually any useful purpose could well involve the use of empirical information obtained through an unpatented means that might have involved transforming matter.  Neither <em>Cochrane</em> nor <em>Gottschalk</em> suggests that that fact renders the phenomenon patentable.  See <em>Cochrane, supra</em>, at 785 (upholding process for improving quality of flour by removing impurities with blasts of air); <em>Gottschalk, supra</em>, at 71\xe2\x80\x9373 (rejecting process for converting numerals to binary form through mathematical formula).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither does the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>State Street Bank</em> help respondents.  That case does say that a process is patentable if it produces a \xe2\x80\x9cuseful, concrete, and tangible result.\xe2\x80\x9d  149 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1373.  But this Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary.  The Court, for example, has invalidated a claim to the use of electromagnetic current for transmitting messages over long distances even though it produces a result that seems \xe2\x80\x9cuseful, concrete, and tangible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morse, supra</em>, at 16.  Similarly the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a system for triggering alarm limits in connection with catalytic conversion despite a similar utility, concreteness, and tangibility.  <em>Flook, supra.  </em>And the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a process that transforms, for computer-programming purposes, decimal figures into binary figures\xe2\x80\x94even though the result would seem useful, concrete, and at least arguably (within the computer\xe2\x80\x99s wiring system) tangible.  <em>Gottschalk,</em> <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even were I to assume (purely for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake) that claim 13 meets certain general definitions of process patentability, however, it still fails the one at issue here: the requirement that it not amount to a simple natural correlation, <em>i.e.</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Flook, supra,</em> at 588, n.\xc2\xa09 (even assuming patent for improved catalytic converter system meets broad statutory definition of patentable \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d it is invalid under natural phenomenon doctrine); <em>Diehr, </em>450 U. S.,<em> </em>at 184\xe2\x80\x93185 (explaining that, even if patent meets all other requirements, it must meet the natural phenomena requirement as well).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At most, respondents have simply described the natural law at issue in the abstract patent language of a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess.\xe2\x80\x9d  But they cannot avoid the fact that the process is no more than an instruction to read some numbers in light of medical knowledge.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 192 (warning against \xe2\x80\x9callow[ing] a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection\xe2\x80\x9d).  One might, of course, reduce the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d to a series of steps, <em>e.g.</em>, Step 1: gather data; Step 2: read a number; Step 3: compare the number with the norm; Step 4: act accordingly.  But one can reduce <em>any </em>process to a series of steps.  The question is what those steps embody.  And here, aside from the unpatented test, they embody only the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency that the researchers uncovered.  In my view, that correlation is an unpatentable \xe2\x80\x9cnatural phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d and I can find nothing in claim 13 that adds anything more of significance.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If I am correct in my conclusion in Part III that the patent is invalid, then special public interest considerations reinforce my view that we should decide this case.  To fail to do so threatens to leave the medical profession subject to the restrictions imposed by this individual patent and others of its kind.  Those restrictions may inhibit doctors from using their best medical judgment; they may force doctors to spend unnecessary time and energy to enter into license agreements; they may divert resources from the medical task of health care to the legal task of searching patent files for similar simple correlations; they may raise the cost of healthcare while inhibiting its effective delivery.  See Brief for American Clinical Laboratory Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if Part III is wrong, however, it still would be valuable to decide this case.  Our doing so would help diminish legal uncertainty in the area, affecting a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial number of patent claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12\xe2\x80\x9314 (filed Aug. 26, 2005).  It would permit those in the medical profession better to understand the nature of their legal obligations.  It would help Congress determine whether legislation is needed. Cf. 35  U.
