VAN PATTEN</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93212.\xe2\x80\x83Decided January 7, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that respondent Joseph Van Patten was entitled to relief under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, reasoning that his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s assistance was presumptively ineffective owing to his participation in a plea hearing by speaker phone.  <em>Van Patten </em>v.<em> Deppisch, </em>434 F.\xc2\xa03d 1038 (2006).  We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Musladin</em>, 549 U. S. ___ (2006).  On remand, the Seventh Circuit adhered to its original decision, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in <em>Musladin</em> requires that our 2006 opinion be changed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Patten </em>v.<em> Endicott, </em>489 F.\xc2\xa03d 827, 828 (2007).  We grant the petition for certiorari now before us and this time reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Van Patten was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide.  His counsel was not physically present at the plea hearing but was linked to the courtroom by speaker phone.  After the state trial court imposed the maximum term of 25 years in prison, Van Patten retained different counsel and moved in the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to withdraw his no-contest plea.  The thrust of the motion was that Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated by his trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s physical absence from the plea hearing.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals noted that, under state law, a postconviction motion to withdraw a no-contest plea will be granted only if a defendant establishes \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest injustice\xe2\x80\x9d by clear and convincing evidence.  See<em> State </em>v.<em> Van Pattten, </em>No. 96\xe2\x80\x933036\xe2\x80\x93CR (Wis. App., May 28, 1997), App. to Pet. for Cert. A47\xe2\x80\x93A48.  While the court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe violation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to counsel may constitute a manifest injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at A48, it found that the absence of Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer from the plea hearing did not violate his right to counsel:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe plea hearing transcript neither indicates any deficiency in the plea colloquy, nor suggests that Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s participation by telephone interfered in any way with [Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s] ability to communicate with his attorney about his plea.  Van Patten confirmed that he had thoroughly discussed his case and plea decision with his attorney and was satisfied with the legal representation he had received.  The court gave Van Patten the opportunity to speak privately with his attorney over the phone if he had questions about the plea, but Van Patten declined.  Further, when Van Patten exercised his right to allocution at sentencing, in the personal presence of his attorney, he raised no objection to his plea.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id</em>., at A49\xe2\x80\x93A50.</p>\n<p align="left">\nApplying <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record does not support, nor does Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s appellate brief include, any argument that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient or prejudicial,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 96\xe2\x80\x933036\xe2\x80\x93CR, App. to Pet. for Cert. A51, and denied Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined further review, Van Patten petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in Federal District Court.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.  It held that Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment claim should have been resolved, not under <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-pronged test (which requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice to the defendant), but under the standard discussed in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cronic</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/648/index.html">466 U. S. 648</a> (1984) (under which prejudice may be presumed).  Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that this case \xe2\x80\x9cpresents [a] novel \xe2\x80\xa6 question,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Deppisch</em>, 434 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1040, and conceded that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder <em>Strickland, </em>it seems clear [that] Van Patten would have no viable claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1042, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cit is clear to us that Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s case must be resolved under <em>Cronic</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1043.  The resolution was in Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the prison warden\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari was pending, this Court decided <em>Musladin, supra.</em>  Musladin had invoked this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cthat certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 1).  The issue was the significance of these precedents in a case under \xc2\xa72254, which bars relief on any claim \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d in state court, unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prejudicial conduct involved in <em>Musladin</em> was courtroom conduct of private actors.  We held that the \xe2\x80\x9cinheren[t] prejudic[e]\xe2\x80\x9d test, which we thus far have applied only in cases involving government-sponsored conduct, see<em>, e.g.,</em> <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/501/index.html">425 U. S. 501</a> (1976); <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Flynn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/560/index.html">475 U. S. 560</a> (1986), did not clearly extend to the conduct of independently acting courtroom spectators.  See<em> Musladin</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 5) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>\xe2\x80\x94asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interest\xe2\x80\x94suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices\xe2\x80\x9d).  For that reason, we reversed the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 grant of habeas relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Musladin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d requirement prompted us to remand Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration.  A majority of the panel reaffirmed its original judgment, however, on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nlike <em>Musladin</em>, this case does not concern an open constitutional question,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Supreme Court has long recognized a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to relief if his defense counsel was actually or constructively absent at a critical stage of the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 828.  Judge Coffey disagreed, observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States Supreme Court has never held that an attorney is presumed to be ineffective if he participates in a plea hearing by speaker phone rather than by physical appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis deleted).  He found that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Majority Opinion does not comport with <em>Musladin</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and dissented from \xe2\x80\x9cthe court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous decision to allow\xe2\x80\x9d its original opinion \xe2\x80\x9cto stand as written,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 829.  We reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984) ordinarily applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea hearing stage.  See <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a>, 58 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he two-part <em>Strickland </em>v.<em> Washington</em> test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it was in a different context that <em>Cronic</em> \xe2\x80\x9crecognized a narrow exception to <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/175/index.html">543 U. S. 175</a>, 190 (2004) (discussing <em>Cronic</em>).  <em>Cronic</em> held that a Sixth Amendment violation may be found \xe2\x80\x9cwithout inquiring into counsel\xe2\x80\x99s actual performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had on the trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html"></a><a href="/us/535/685/index.html">535 U.

Our precedents do not clearly hold that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s participation by speaker phone should be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete denial of counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d on par with total absence.  Even if we agree with Van Patten that a lawyer physically present will tend to perform better than one on the phone, it does not necessarily follow that mere telephone contact amounted to total absence or \xe2\x80\x9cprevented [counsel] from assisting the accused,\xe2\x80\x9d so as to entail application of <em>Cronic</em>.  The question is not whether counsel in those circumstances will perform less well than he otherwise would, but whether the circumstances are likely to result in such poor performance that an inquiry into its effects would not be worth the time.  Cf.<em> United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>, 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 7) (Sixth Amendment ensures \xe2\x80\x9c<em>effective</em> (not mistake-free) representation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  Our cases provide no categorical answer to this question, and for that matter the several proceedings in this case hardly point toward one.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance by speaker phone to be constitutionally effective; neither the Magistrate Judge, the District Court, nor the Seventh Circuit disputed this conclusion; and the Seventh Circuit itself stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder <em>Strickland</em>, it seems clear Van Patten would have no viable claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Deppisch, </em>434 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1042.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because our cases give no clear answer to the question presented, let alone one in Van Patten\xe2\x80\x99s favor, \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be said that the state court \xe2\x80\x98unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Musladin</em>, 549 U.

In my view, this interpretation is correct.  The fact that in 1984, when <em>Cronic </em>was decided, neither the parties nor the Court contemplated representation by attorneys who were not present in the flesh explains the author\xe2\x80\x99s failure to add the words \xe2\x80\x9cin open court\xe2\x80\x9d after the word \xe2\x80\x9cpresent.\xe2\x80\x9d</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explains today, however, the question is not the reasonableness of the federal court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of <em>Cronic, </em>but rather whether the Wisconsin court\xe2\x80\x99s narrower reading of that opinion was \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U.

Thomas</em> <em>v.</em> <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Leary</em>, 856 F.\xc2\xa02d 1011, 1014 (7th Cir. 1988).  Indeed, with plea bargaining the norm and trial the exception, for most criminal defendants a change of plea hearing is <em>the</em> critical stage of their prosecution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In deciding whether to dispense with the two-part <em>Strickland</em> inquiry, a court must evaluate whether the \xe2\x80\x98surrounding circumstances make it unlikely that the defendant could have received the effective assistance of counsel,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Cronic</em>, 466 U. S. at 666, and thus \xe2\x80\x98justify a presumption that [the] conviction was insufficiently reliable to satisfy the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>id.</em> at 662.  In this case, although the transcript shows that the state trial judge did his best to conduct the plea colloquy with care, the arrangements made it impossible for Van Patten to have the \xe2\x80\x98assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x99 in anything but the most perfunctory sense.  Van Patten stood alone before judge and prosecutor.  Unlike the usual defendant in a criminal case, he could not turn to his lawyer for private legal advice, to clear up misunderstandings, to seek reassurance, or to discuss any last-minute misgivings.  Listening over an audio connection, counsel could not detect and respond to cues from his client\xe2\x80\x99s demeanor that might have indicated he did not understand certain aspects of the proceeding, or that he was changing his mind.  If Van Patten wished to converse with his attorney, anyone else in the courtroom could effectively eavesdrop.  (We assume the district attorney would balk if he were expected to conduct last-minute consultations with his staff via speakerphone in open court, \xe2\x80\x98on the record,\xe2\x80\x99 with the defendant taking in every word.)  No advance arrangements had been made for a private line in a private place, and even if one could \xe2\x80\x98perhaps\xe2\x80\x99 have been provided, it would have required a special request by Van Patten and, apparently, a break in the proceedings.  In short, this was not an auspicious setting for someone about to waive very valuable constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Patten </em>v. <em>Deppisch</em>, 434 F.\xc2\xa03d 1038, 1042\xe2\x80\x931043 (CA7 2006).</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
