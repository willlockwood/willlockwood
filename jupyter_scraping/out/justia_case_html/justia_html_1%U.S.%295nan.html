They admitted that reasonable privilege had likewise, been allowed in Pennsylvania; but denied that, in either country, the doctrine had been extended to the object of the present rule. For, they insisted, that the Sheriff\'s attendance upon the Executive Council, was voluntary, in order to solicit an appointment, which, notwithstanding his being on the return, the Council might, at pleasure, grant, or refuse. Neither was he bound to give security \'till he was appointed; and, even then, it was not necessary to be given in the city of Philadlphia. With respect to the Lieutenant of the county, nothing, they said, could be more evident, than that his visit to Philadelphia was an act of supererogation, to perform what no law required him to do, and what might as well have been performed through the agency of a Post-rider. </p><p> If, indeed, the attendance of the Sheriff, or of the Lieutenant of the county had been required by the Executive Council; or, if they had been brought before that Board by any legal process; they might then have claimed the advantage of the general rule of privilege. But there can be no pretence in reason, or law, to exempt from an arrest, either a man, who voluntarily comes to solicit an office; or one, who undertakes a journey merely to oblige his neighbours by bringing them their commission. </p><p> At an adjourned sittings, held on the 6th of September, the President delivered the clear, and unanimous opinion of the Court, that the Defendants were not protected from arrests, for any cause that had been shewn. He observed, that they had not been required by the Executive Council to attend them, but evidently came to Philadelphia on their own private business; and that it was the duty of the Court to be careful not to extend the doctrine of privilege to the injury of honest creditors. </p><p> The rule discharged. <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1907435">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> MORGAN v.
