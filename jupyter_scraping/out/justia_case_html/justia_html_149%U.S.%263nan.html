Nash and Dupee were both made defendants.  After issue joined, the cause was removed to the circuit court of the United States on the defendants\' motion on the ground of local prejudice.  Trial was had there which resulted in a decree, December 4, 1890, against Nash for the payment of the debt, and against Dupee for the sale of the land on failure of Nash to make the payment within ten days from the decree.
