There is no bill of exceptions.  The so-called statement of facts is mainly a recapitulation of evidence introduced by the parties at the trial.  The case was not submitted to the decision of the court upon that statement only, but the court made a further finding as to what took place at the trial.  That finding merely states that the parties admitted that, so far as the facts were stated in a certain reported opinion of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, they were a correct statement of the facts of this case, but that each party claimed that there existed additional facts, as to which there is no finding.  On referring to that opinion, such facts as are there stated appear to be scattered through it, intermingled with statements of conflicting evidence and with the court\'s conclusions of fact upon that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 132 U.

Police Jury of Terrebonne Parish,</em> 30 La.Ann. 287.</p>\n<p>In short, there is nothing in the present case which can be called in any legal or proper sense either a statement of facts by the parties or a finding of facts by the court, and no question of law is presented in such a form as to authorize this Court to consider it.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
