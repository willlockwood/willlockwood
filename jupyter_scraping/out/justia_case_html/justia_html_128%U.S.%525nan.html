But it is now assigned for error that as defendant and complainants below were citizens of the same state, and the bill did not allege that the trademark in controversy was "used on goods intended to be transported to a foreign country," Act of March 3, 1881, c. 138, \xc2\xa7 11, 21 Stat. 502, the circuit court had no jurisdiction and the decree must be reversed for that reason.  The objection is well taken, and the decree is accordingly</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
