The District Court denied his motion to have the indictment dismissed because it did not allege a specific overt act that he committed in seeking reentry.  In reversing, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the indictment\xe2\x80\x99s omission of an overt act was a fatal flaw not subject to harmless-error review.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s indictment was not defective, and, thus, this Court need not reach the harmless-error issue.  While the Government does not dispute that respondent cannot be guilty of attempted reentry under \xc2\xa71326(a) unless he committed an overt act qualifying as a substantial step toward completing his goal or that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it charges,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 228, it contends that the instant indictment implicitly alleged that respondent engaged in the necessary overt act by alleging that he \xe2\x80\x9cattempted\xe2\x80\x9d to enter the country.  This Court agrees.  Not only does \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d as used in common parlance connote action rather than mere intent, but, more importantly, as used in the law for centuries, it encompasses both the overt act and intent elements.  Thus, an indictment alleging attempted reentry under \xc2\xa71326(a) need not specifically allege a particular overt act or any other \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent par[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense.  See <em>Hamling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/index.html">418 U. S. 87</a>, 117.  It was enough for the indictment to point to the relevant criminal statute and allege that respondent \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally attempted to enter the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 at or near San Louis \xe2\x80\xa6 Arizona\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about June 1, 2003.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 8.  An indictment has two constitutional requirements: \xe2\x80\x9cfirst, [it must] contai[n] the elements of the offense charged and fairly infor[m] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, [it must] enabl[e] him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hamling</em>, 418 U. S., at 117.  Here, the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt,\xe2\x80\x9d coupled with the specification of the time and place of the alleged reentry, satisfied both.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the indictment would have been sufficient only if it alleged any of three overt acts performed during his attempted reentry\xe2\x80\x94that he walked into an inspection area; that he presented a misleading identification card; or that he lied to the inspector\xe2\x80\x94is rejected.  Respondent is correct that some crimes must be charged with greater specificity than an indictment parroting a federal criminal statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, see <em>Russell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/749/index.html">369 U.

Because the indictment failed to allege a specific overt act that he committed in seeking reentry, the Court of Appeals set aside his conviction and remanded for dismissal of the indictment.  We granted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to answer the question whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from a federal indictment can constitute harmless error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Government expressly declined to \xe2\x80\x9cseek review of the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 threshold holdings that the commission of an overt act was an element of the offense of attempted unlawful reentry and that the indictment failed to allege that element,\xe2\x80\x9d Pet. for Cert. 9, n.\xc2\xa03, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ashwander </em>v.<em> TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U.

For that reason, after oral argument we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs directed to the question whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s indictment was in fact defective.

On that day, respondent walked up to a port of entry and displayed a photo identification of his cousin to the border agent.  Respondent told the agent that he was a legal resident and that he was traveling to Calexico, California.  Because he did not resemble his cousin, respondent was questioned, taken into custody, and ultimately charged with a violation of 8 U.

The District Court denied the motion and, after the jury found him guilty, sentenced respondent to a 63-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning that an indictment\xe2\x80\x99s omission of \xe2\x80\x9can essential element of the offense is a fatal flaw not subject to mere harmless error analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  425 F. 3d 729, 732 (2005).  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s indictment was fatally flawed because it nowhere alleged \xe2\x80\x9cany specific overt act that is a substantial step\xe2\x80\x9d toward the completion of the unlawful reentry.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 733.  The panel majority explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe defendant has a right to be apprised of what overt act the government will try to prove at trial, and he has a right to have a grand jury consider whether to charge that specific overt act.  Physical crossing into a government inspection area is but one of a number of other acts that the government might have alleged as a substantial step toward entry into the United States.  The indictment might have alleged the tendering a bogus identification card; it might have alleged successful clearance of the inspection area; or it might have alleged lying to an inspection officer with the purpose of being admitted\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

Nor does it dispute that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Almendarez-Torres</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/224/index.html">523 U. S. 224</a>, 228 (1998).  It instead contends that the indictment at bar implicitly alleged that respondent engaged in the necessary overt act \xe2\x80\x9csimply by alleging that he \xe2\x80\x98attempted to enter the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Supplemental Brief for United States 8.  We agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only does the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d as used in common parlance connote action rather than mere intent, but more importantly, as used in the law for centuries, it encompasses both the overt act and intent elements.  Consequently, an indictment alleging attempted illegal reentry under \xc2\xa71326(a) need not specifically allege a particular overt act or any other \xe2\x80\x9ccomponent par[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense.  See <em>Hamling </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/index.html">418 U. S. 87</a>, 119 (1974).  Just as it was enough for the indictment in <em>Hamling</em> to allege that the defendant mailed \xe2\x80\x9cobscene\xe2\x80\x9d material in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71461, see 418 U. S., at 117\xe2\x80\x93118, it was enough for the indictment in this case to point to the relevant criminal statute and allege that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about June 1, 2003,\xe2\x80\x9d respondent \xe2\x80\x9cattempted to enter the United States of America at or near San Luis in the District of Arizona.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  App. 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Hamling</em>, we identified two constitutional requirements for an indictment: \xe2\x80\x9cfirst, [that it] contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, [that it] enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  418 U. S., at 117.  In this case, the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt,\xe2\x80\x9d coupled with the specification of the time and place of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attempted illegal reentry, satisfied both.  Indeed, the time-and-place information provided respondent with more adequate notice than would an indictment describing particular overt acts.  After all, a given defendant may have approached the border or lied to a border-patrol agent in the course of countless attempts on innumerable occasions.  For the same reason, the time-and-date specification in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s indictment provided ample protection against the risk of multiple prosecutions for the same crime.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent nonetheless maintains that the indictment would have been sufficient only if it had alleged any of three overt acts performed during his attempted reentry: that he walked into an inspection area; that he presented a misleading identification card; or that he lied to the inspector.  See Supplemental Brief for Respondent 7.  Individually and cumulatively, those acts tend to prove the charged attempt\xe2\x80\x94but none was essential to the finding of guilt in this case.  All three acts were rather part of a single course of conduct culminating in the charged \xe2\x80\x9cattempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Justice Holmes explained in <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/196/375/index.html">196 U. S. 375</a>, 396 (1905), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he unity of the plan embraces all the parts.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent is of course correct that while an indictment parroting the language of a federal criminal statute is often sufficient, there are crimes that must be charged with greater specificity.  See <em>Hamling,</em> 418 U. S., at 117.  A clear example is the statute making it a crime for a witness summoned before a congressional committee to refuse to answer any question \xe2\x80\x9cpertinent to the question under inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7192.  As we explained at length in our opinion in <em>Russell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/749/index.html">369 U. S. 749</a> (1962), a valid indictment for such a refusal to testify must go beyond the words of \xc2\xa7192 and allege the subject of the congressional hearing in order to determine whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal was \xe2\x80\x9cpertinent.<f f="Times New Roman">\xe2\x80\x9d<f f="Century Schoolbook">  Based on a number of cases arising out of congressional investigations, we recognized that the relevant hearing\xe2\x80\x99s subject was frequently uncertain but invariably \xe2\x80\x9ccentral to every prosecution under the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>, </em>at 764.  Both to provide fair notice to defendants and to assure that any conviction would arise out of the theory of guilt presented to the grand jury, we held that indictments under \xc2\xa7192 must do more than restate the language of the statute.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our reasoning in <em>Russell</em> suggests that there was no infirmity in the present indictment.  First, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Russell</em>, guilt under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(a) does not \xe2\x80\x9cdepen[d] so crucially upon such a specific identification of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  369 U. S., at 764.  Second, before explaining the special need for particularity in charges brought under 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7192, Justice Stewart noted that, in 1872, Congress had enacted a statute reflecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe drift of the law away from the rules of technical and formalized pleading which had characterized an earlier era.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  369 U. S.,  at 762.  After the repeal of that statute, there was no other legislation dealing generally with the subject of indictments until the promulgation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1).  As we have said, the Federal Rules \xe2\x80\x9cwere designed to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleadings and are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v.<em> Debrow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/374/index.html">346 U. S. 374</a>, 376 (1953).  While detailed allegations might well have been required under common-law pleading rules, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee,</em> 177 Mass. 267, 59 N.\xc2\xa0E. 55 (1901),<em> </em>they surely are not contemplated by Rule 7(c)(1), which provides that an indictment \xe2\x80\x9cshall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we are satisfied that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s indictment fully complied with that Rule and did not deprive him of any significant protection that the constitutional guarantee of a grand jury was intended to confer, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Title 8 U.

Compare <em>ibid</em>. with <em>Resendiz-Ponce</em>, 425 F. 3d at 729, 733.  With all due respect to his principled position, we think that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial step\xe2\x80\x9d requirement is implicit in the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt,\xe2\x80\x9d and we do not believe that adding those four words would have given respondent any greater notice of the charges against him or protection against future prosecution.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Likewise, it would it be unrealistic to suggest that respondent actually committed three separate attempt offenses involving three different overt acts.  Indeed, if each overt act were treated as a separate element, an attempt involving multiple overt acts might conceivably qualify for several separate offenses, thus perversely enhancing, rather than avoiding, the risk of successive prosecution for the same wrong.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The 1872 statute provided that \xe2\x80\x9cno indictment found and presented by a grand jury in any district or circuit \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form only, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78, 17 Stat. 198.  The opinion in <em>Russell </em>noted that the 1872 statute had been repealed, but its substance had been preserved in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).  See<em> </em>369 U. S., at 762.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c) is also instructive.

If a defendant indicted only for a completed offense can be convicted of attempt under Rule 31(c) without the indictment ever mentioning an overt act, it would be illogical to dismiss an indictment charging \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d because it fails to allege such an act.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962246">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

S. 224</a>, 228 (1998); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cook</em>, 17 Wall. 168, 174 (1872).  As the Court acknowledges, it is likewise well established that \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d contains two substantive elements: the <em>intent</em> to commit the underlying crime, and the undertaking of <em>some action </em>toward commission of that crime.  See<em> ante</em>, at 4 (citing 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa711.2(a), p.\xc2\xa0205 (2d ed. 2003), E. Coke, Third Institute 5 (6th ed. 1680), and Keedy, Criminal Attempts at Common Law, 102 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 464, 468 (1954)).  See also <em>Braxton</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/344/index.html">500 U. S. 344</a>, 349 (1991).  It should follow, then, that when the Government indicts for attempt to commit a crime, it must allege both that the defendant had the intent to commit the crime, <em>and</em> that he took some action toward its commission.  Any rule to the contrary would be an exception to the standard practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court gives two reasons for its special \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  First, it says that in \xe2\x80\x9ccommon parlance\xe2\x80\x9d the word attempt \xe2\x80\x9cconnote[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cimpli[es],\xe2\x80\x9d both the intent and overt-act elements.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  This strikes me as certainly irrelevant, and probably incorrect to boot.  It is irrelevant because, as I have just discussed, we have always required the elements of a crime to be explicitly set forth in the indictment, <em>whether or not </em>they are fairly called to mind by the mere name of the crime.  Burglary, for example, connotes in common parlance the entry of a building with felonious intent, yet we require those elements to be set forth.  Our precedents make clear that the indictment must \xe2\x80\x9cfully, directly, and <em>expressly</em>, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Carll</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/105/611/index.html">105 U. S. 611</a>, 612 (1882) (emphasis added).  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is probably incorrect because I doubt that the common meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d conveys with precision what conviction of that crime requires.   A reasonable grand juror, relying on nothing but that term, might well believe that it connotes intent plus any minor action toward the commission of the crime, rather than the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial step\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court acknowledges is required, <em>ante</em>, at 5.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Besides appealing to \xe2\x80\x9ccommon parlance,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court relies on the fact that attempt, \xe2\x80\x9cas used in the law for centuries \xe2\x80\xa6 encompasses both the overt act and intent elements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  Once again, this argument seems to me certainly irrelevant and probably incorrect.  Many common-law crimes have retained relatively static elements throughout history, burglary among them; that has never been thought to excuse the specification of those elements in the indictment.  And the argument is probably incorrect, because the definition of attempt has not been nearly as consistent as the Court suggests.  Nearly a century ago, a leading criminal-law treatise pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98attempt\xe2\x80\x99 is a term peculiarly indefinite\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cno prescribed legal meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law<em> </em>\xc2\xa7229, p.\xc2\xa0298 (11th ed. 1912).  Even the modern treatise the Court relies upon, see <em>ante,</em> at 4, explains\xe2\x80\x94in a subsection entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Confusion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that jurisdictions vary widely in how they define the requisite actus reus.  LaFave, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa711.4(a), at 218\xe2\x80\x93219.  Among the variations are: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an act toward the commission of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 some offense\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9can act \xe2\x80\x98in furtherance of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an offense; \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a substantial step toward the commission of the crime\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some appreciable fragment of the crime\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and the wonderfully opaque \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commencement of the consummation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa711.4(a), at 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (footnote omitted).  These are not simply different ways of saying \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial step.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Model Penal Code definition that the Court invokes, <em>ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, is just that: a model.  It does not establish the degree of homogeneity that the Court asserts.  The contention that the \xe2\x80\x9cfederal system\xe2\x80\x9d has a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-settled\xe2\x80\x9d definition of attempt, see Supplemental Brief for United States 22, tells us nothing; many terms in federal indictments have only one <em>federal</em> definition, not because that is the universally accepted definition, but because there is only one Federal Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the indictment alleged that respondent \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally attempted to enter the United States of America,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 8, so that the Court focuses only on whether the indictment needed to allege the second element of attempt, an overt act.  If one accepts the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, the indictment could just as well have omitted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally,\xe2\x80\x9d since that is understood in \xe2\x80\x9ccommon parlance,\xe2\x80\x9d and has been an element of attempt \xe2\x80\x9cfor centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Would we say that, in a prosecution for first-degree murder, the element of \xe2\x80\x9cmalice aforethought\xe2\x80\x9d could be omitted from the indictment simply because it is commonly understood, and the law has always required it?  Surely not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole judicial authority the Court cites for its novel exception to the traditional indictment requirements (other than an unpublished opinion of a district court, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03) is <em>Hamling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/index.html">418 U. S. 87</a> (1974).  The relevant portion of that opinion consists of the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe definition of obscenity \xe2\x80\xa6 is not a question of fact, but one of law; the word \xe2\x80\x98obscene,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is not merely a generic or descriptive term, but a legal term of art.  The legal definition of obscenity does not change with each indictment; it is a term sufficiently definite in legal meaning to give a defendant notice of the charge against him.  Since the various component parts of the constitutional definition of obscenity need not be alleged in the indictment in order to establish its sufficiency, the indictment in this case was sufficient to adequately inform petitioners of the charges against them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93119 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf these sentences established the broad principle the Court asserts, they would apply not only to the elements of attempt, but to the elements of all crimes, effecting a revolution in our jurisprudence regarding the requirements of an indictment.  In fact, however, <em>Hamling </em>is easily distinguishable.  \xe2\x80\x9cObscenity\xe2\x80\x9d is, to be sure, one of the elements of the crime of publishing obscenity.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cvarious component parts of the constitutional definition of obscenity\xe2\x80\x9d are no more <em>elements</em> of the crime of publishing obscenity than the various component parts of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding\xe2\x80\x9d are elements of the crime of burglary.  To be sure, those definitions must be met for conviction; but they need not be set forth in the indictment.  If every word contained within the definition of each element of a crime were <em>itself </em>an element of the crime within the meaning of the indictment requirement, there would be no end to the prolixity of indictments.  There is no dispute here that \xe2\x80\x9cintent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial step\xe2\x80\x9d are elements of the federal crime of attempt, just as obscenity was an element of the crime charged in <em>Hamling</em>.  <em>Hamling </em>would be in point if it dispensed with the charging of obscenity in the indictment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court finds another point \xe2\x80\x9cinstructive\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cIf a defendant indicted only for a completed offense can be convicted of attempt \xe2\x80\xa6 without the indictment\xe2\x80\x99s ever mentioning an overt act, it would be illogical to dismiss an indictment charging \xe2\x80\x98attempt\xe2\x80\x99 because it fails to allege such an act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa07.  I disagree; it seems to me entirely logical.  To indict for commission of a <em>completed offense</em>, the prosecutor must persuade the grand jury that the accused\xe2\x80\x99s acts and state of mind fulfilled all the elements of the offense.  If they did so, and if the offense has a <em>mens rea </em>element (which almost all crimes, including burglary, do), then they unquestionably fulfilled all the elements of an attempt as well\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the accused meant to commit the crime and took the requisite step (no matter how demanding the requirement) in that direction.  That is to say, attempt to commit a crime is simply a lesser included offense.  A grand-jury finding that the accused committed the crime is <em>necessarily</em> a finding that he attempted to commit the crime, and therefore the attempt need not be separately charged.  When, however, the prosecutor seeks only an indictment for attempt, it is not enough to tell the grand jury that it requires a finding of \xe2\x80\x9csome, but not all, of the elements of the substantive crime\xe2\x80\x9d; he must specify what the elements of attempt consist of.  He must do that for the same reason a court must <em>instruct </em>the petit jury on the attempt elements, see 2 E. Devitt, C. Blackmar, &amp; K. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \xc2\xa721.03, p.\xc2\xa04, Notes (4th ed. 1990) (collecting cases), even when the indictment has not separately <em>charged </em>attempt: without such specification, the jury, grand or petit, cannot intelligently find attempt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court suggests that there is something different about attempt because it is a parasitic crime.  There is no such crime as bald attempt; it must be attempt <em>to commit some other crime.  </em>This is unquestionably true, fully as true as the fact that attempt begins with an \xe2\x80\x9ca.\xe2\x80\x9d  But there is no reason why the one, any more than the other, has anything to do with the purposes, and hence the substance, of the indictment requirement.  Conspiracy is also, in most cases, a parasitic crime, and no one contends that its elements need not be charged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the clear answer provided by straightforward application of the oft-recited principles of our jurisprudence, I might have been persuaded to recognize an (illogical) exception to those principles if the Government had demonstrated that mere recitation of the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d in attempt indictments has been the traditional practice.  But its effort to do so falls far short; in fact, it has not even undertaken such an effort.  The Government has pointed to some cases that allow an indictment simply to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cattempt,\xe2\x80\x9d and many others that invalidate an indictment for failure to allege an overt act.  See Supplemental Brief for United States 15\xe2\x80\x9321.  It matters not whether more of one sort or the other of these cases arose in state courts or federal courts; the point is that there is no established historical \xe2\x80\x9cattempt\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the general principles of our jurisprudence.  That being so, those principles must prevail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be clear, I need not decide in this case whether, as the Ninth Circuit held, the Government was required to specify in the indictment which particular overt act it would be relying on at trial.  Cf. <em>Russell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/749/index.html">369 U. S. 749</a> (1962).  It suffices to support the judgment, that the Government <em>was</em> required to state not only that Resendiz-Ponce \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and intentionally attempted to enter the United States of America,\xe2\x80\x9d but also that he \xe2\x80\x9ctook a substantial step\xe2\x80\x9d toward that end.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My dissenting view that the indictment was faulty (a point on which we requested supplemental briefing) puts me in the odd position of being the sole Justice who must decide the question on which we granted certiorari: whether a constitutionally deficient indictment is structural error, as the Ninth Circuit held, or rather is amenable to harmless-error analysis.  I cannot vote to affirm or to reverse the judgment without resolving that issue.  Since the full Court will undoubtedly have to speak to the point on another day (it dodged the bullet today by inviting and deciding a <em>different</em> constitutional issue\xe2\x80\x94albeit, to be fair, a narrower one) there is little use in my setting forth my views in detail.  It should come as no surprise, given my opinions in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), and <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 30 (1999) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that I would find the error to be structural.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
