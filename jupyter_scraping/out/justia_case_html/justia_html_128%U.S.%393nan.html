The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>De Walt, the appellee, was tried and convicted, upon an information, of the crime of embezzlement and making false entries as the president of a national bank in violation of \xc2\xa7 5209 of the Revised Statutes, and sentenced and committed to the penitentiary for ten years.  This section prescribes the punishment of imprisonment for not less than five nor more than ten years, which imprisonment may be ordered to be executed in a state jail or penitentiary.  Rev.Stat. \xef\xbf\xbd 5541.  Appellee was subsequently discharged on habeas corpus upon the ground that the crime in question was an infamous crime for which he could not, under the Constitution, be held to answer on information, but only on presentment or indictment by a grand jury.  From the order discharging him, this appeal is prosecuted, and it is contended that a crime is not infamous which is not subject to the penalty of hard labor as part of the punishment of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>This, however, was otherwise ruled in <em>Mackin v.
