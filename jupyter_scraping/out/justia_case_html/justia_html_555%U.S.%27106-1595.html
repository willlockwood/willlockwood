METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x931595.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 8, 2008\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 26, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">In response to questions from an official of respondent local government (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual harassment by the Metro School District employee relations director (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that Hughes had sexually harassed her.  Metro took no action against Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement.  She filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, in violation of 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), which makes it unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cfor an employer to discriminate against any \xe2\x80\xa6 employe[e]\xe2\x80\x9d who (1) \xe2\x80\x9chas opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d (opposition clause), or (2) \xe2\x80\x9chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d (participation clause).  The court granted Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the opposition clause demanded \xe2\x80\x9cactive, consistent\xe2\x80\x9d opposing activities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not cover Metro\xe2\x80\x99s internal investigation because it was not conducted pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The antiretaliation provision\xe2\x80\x99s protection extends to an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in answering questions during an employer\xe2\x80\x99s internal investigation.  Because \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dictionary meaning of resisting or contending against.  Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disapproving account of Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s sexually obnoxious behavior toward her.  \xe2\x80\x9cOppose\xe2\x80\x9d goes beyond \xe2\x80\x9cactive, consistent\xe2\x80\x9d behavior in ordinary discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it.  Thus, a person can \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d by responding to someone else\xe2\x80\x99s questions just as surely as by provoking the discussion.  Nothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when asked a question.  Metro unconvincingly argues for the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s active, consistent opposition rule, claiming that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go badly for an employee who responded to enquiries.  Employers, however, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to discriminatory activity in their operations because <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U.

Because Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is covered by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.

The question here is whether this protection extends to an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in answering questions during an employer\xe2\x80\x99s internal investigation.  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, respondent Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee (Metro), began looking into rumors of sexual harassment by the Metro School District\xe2\x80\x99s employee relations director, Gene Hughes.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  211 Fed. Appx. 373, 374 (CA6 2006).  When Veronica Frazier, a Metro human resources officer, asked petitioner Vicky Crawford, a 30-year Metro employee, whether she had witnessed \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate behavior\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of Hughes, <em>id.</em>, at 374\xe2\x80\x93375, Crawford described several instances of sexually harassing behavior: once, Hughes had answered her greeting, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Hey Dr. Hughes, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by grabbing his crotch and saying \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[Y]ou know what\xe2\x80\x99s up\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; he had repeatedly \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98put his crotch up to [her] window\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and on one occasion he had entered her office and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98grabbed her head and pulled it to his crotch,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 375, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Two other employees also reported being sexually harassed by Hughes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 375.  Although Metro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawford and the two other accusers soon after finishing the investigation, saying in Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s case that it was for embezzlement.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Crawford claimed Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and filed a charge of a Title VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses, making it \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees \xe2\x80\xa6 [1] because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or [2] because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

The one is known as the \xe2\x80\x9copposition clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the other as the \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation clause,\xe2\x80\x9d and Crawford accused Metro of violating both.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment for Metro.  It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposition clause because she had not \xe2\x80\x9cinstigated or initiated any complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d but had \xe2\x80\x9cmerely answered questions by investigators in an already-pending internal investigation, initiated by someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d  Memorandum Opinion, No. 3:03\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300996 (MD Tenn., Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 16a\xe2\x80\x9317a.

Again like the trial judge, the Court of Appeals understood that Crawford could show no violation of the participation clause because her \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98employer\xe2\x80\x99s internal investigation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was not conducted \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pursuant to a pending EEOC charge.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Abbott</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 543).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision conflicts with those of other Circuits, particularly as to the opposition clause, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McDonnell </em>v. <em>Cisneros</em>, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA7 1996), we granted Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  552 U.

We now reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opposition clause makes it \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful \xe2\x80\xa6 for an employer to discriminate against any \xe2\x80\xa6 employe[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 because he has opposed any practice made \xe2\x80\xa6 unlawful \xe2\x80\xa6 by this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  The term \xe2\x80\x9coppose,\xe2\x80\x9d being left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinary meaning, <em>Perrin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/37/index.html">444 U.

Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s description of the louche goings-on would certainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as \xe2\x80\x9cresist[ant]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cantagoni[stic]\xe2\x80\x9d to Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s treatment, if for no other reason than the point argued by the Government and explained by an EEOC guideline: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in \xe2\x80\xa6 a form of employment discrimination, that communication\xe2\x80\x9d virtually always \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>opposition</em> to the activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9 (citing 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II\xe2\x80\x93B(1), (2), p.\xc2\xa0614:0003 (Mar. 2003)); see also <em>Federal Express Corp.</em> v. <em>Holowecki</em>, 552 U.

It is true that one can imagine exceptions, like an employee\xe2\x80\x99s description of a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s racist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases, and this is not one of them.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit thought answering questions fell short of opposition, taking the view that the clause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98demands active, consistent \xe2\x80\x9copposing\xe2\x80\x9d activities to warrant \xe2\x80\xa6 protection against retaliation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting <em>Bell</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 610), and that an employee must \xe2\x80\x9cinstigat[e] or initiat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d a complaint to be covered, 211 Fed. Appx., at 376.  But though these requirements obviously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they are not limits of it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOppose\xe2\x80\x9d goes beyond \xe2\x80\x9cactive, consistent\xe2\x80\x9d behavior in ordinary discourse, where we would naturally use the word to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it.  Countless people were known to \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d slavery before Emancipation, or are said to \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d capital punishment today, without writing public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting the government.  And we would call it \xe2\x80\x9copposition\xe2\x80\x9d if an employee took a stand against an employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory practices not by \xe2\x80\x9cinstigating\xe2\x80\x9d action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons.  Cf. <em>McDonnell,</em> <em>supra, </em>at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliated against him for failing to prevent his subordinate from filing an EEOC charge).  There is, then, no reason to doubt that a person can \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d by responding to someone else\xe2\x80\x99s question just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when her boss asks a question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Metro and its <em>amici</em> support the Circuit panel\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d opposition by arguing that the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likely it is that employers will look into what may be happening outside the executive suite.  As they see it, if retaliation\nis an easy charge when things go bad for an employee\nwho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid the headache by refusing to raise questions about possible discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument is unconvincing, for we think it underestimates the incentive to enquire that follows from our decisions in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ellerth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/742/index.html">524 U. S. 742</a> (1998), and <em>Faragher</em> v. <em>Boca Raton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/775/index.html"></a><a href="/us/524/775/index.html">524 U. S. 775</a> (1998).  <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> hold \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n employer \xe2\x80\xa6 subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with \xe2\x80\xa6 authority over the employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ellerth</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 765; <em>Faragher</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 807.  Although there is no affirmative defense if the hostile environment \xe2\x80\x9cculminates in a tangible employment action\xe2\x80\x9d against the employee, <em>Ellerth</em>, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken\xe2\x80\x9d if it \xe2\x80\x9cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any\xe2\x80\x9d discriminatory conduct and \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  Employers are thus subject to a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any discriminatory activity in their operations as a way to break the circuit of imputed liability.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also Brief for Petitioner 24\xe2\x80\x9328, and nn.\xc2\xa031\xe2\x80\x9335 (citing studies demonstrating that <em>Ellerth</em> and <em>Faragher</em> have prompted many employers to adopt or strengthen procedures for investigating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory conduct).  The possibility that an employer might someday want to fire someone who might charge discrimination traceable to an internal investigation does not strike us as likely to diminish the attraction of an <em>Ellerth</em>-<em>Faragher</em> affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule would not itself largely undermine the <em>Ellerth</em>-<em>Faragher</em> scheme, along with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98primary objective\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[ing] harm\xe2\x80\x9d to employees.  <em>Faragher</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 806 (quoting <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U. S. 405</a>, 417 (1975)).  If it were clear law that an employee who reported discrimination in answering an employer\xe2\x80\x99s questions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep quiet about Title VII offenses against themselves or against others.  This is no imaginary horrible given the documented indications that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why people stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about bias and discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also <em>id.</em>, at 37, and n.\xc2\xa058 (compiling studies).  The appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s rule would thus create a real dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile work environment if the boss took steps to assure a defense under our cases.  If the employee reported discrimination in response to the enquiries, the employer might well be free to penalize her for speaking up.

But that does not mean the end of this case, for Metro\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment raised several defenses to the retaliation charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the District Court never reached these others owing to its ruling on the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on remand.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because this case arises out of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment for Metro, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are required to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, [Crawford].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brosseau </em>v.<em> Haugen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/194/index.html">543 U.

But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees who are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by \xe2\x80\x9ctak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.; </em>it is based on the general principle \xe2\x80\x9cthat a victim has a duty \xe2\x80\x98to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize \xe2\x80\xa6 damages,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 806 (quoting <em>Ford Motor Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/219/index.html">458 U.

We have never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to report discrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative, let alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak.  Extending the mitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees will often face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselves face, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others.  Thus, they are not \xe2\x80\x9cvictims\xe2\x80\x9d of anything until they are retaliated against, and it would be absurd to require them to \xe2\x80\x9cmitigate\xe2\x80\x9d damages they may be unaware they will suffer.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962782">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nCRAWFORD V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. V), prohibits retaliation against an employee who testifies in an internal investigation of alleged sexual harassment.  I agree with the Court that the \xe2\x80\x9copposition clause\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (2000 ed.) prohibits retaliation for such conduct.  I also agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s primary reasoning, which is based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe point argued by the Government and explained by an EEOC guideline: \xe2\x80\x98When an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in \xe2\x80\xa6 a form of employment discrimination, that communication\xe2\x80\x99 virtually always \xe2\x80\x98constitutes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>opposition</em> to the activity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ante</em>, at 4.  I write separately to emphasize my understanding that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding does not\nand should not extend beyond employees who testify in internal investigations or engage in analogous purposive conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court concludes, the term \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d does not denote conduct that necessarily rises to the level required by the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> conduct that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consistent\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinstigated or initiated\xe2\x80\x9d by the employee.  211 Fed. Appx. 373, 376 (2006).  The primary definitions of the term \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d do, however, require conduct that is active and purposive.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1709\xe2\x80\x931710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter Random Dict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866\xe2\x80\x93867 (2d ed. 1989).  For example, the first three definitions of the term in the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies are as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2. to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an opponent or adversary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed. 1987).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9ctaking action (including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress, or correct unlawful discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to decide the question that is before us, we have no need to adopt a definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d that is broader than the definition that petitioner advances.  But in dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in the Random House Dictionary of the English Language goes further, defining \xe2\x80\x9coppose\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to be hostile or adverse to, <em>as in opinion.</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (emphasis added).  Thus, this definition embraces silent opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this is certainly <em>an</em> accepted usage of the term \xe2\x80\x9coppose,\xe2\x80\x9d the term is not always used in this sense, and it is questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the opposition clause of 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  It is noteworthy that all of the other conduct protected by this provision\xe2\x80\x94making a charge, testifying, or assisting or participating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\xe2\x80\x94requires active and purposive conduct.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98That several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>S.\xc2\xa0D. Warren Co.</em> v<em>. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/370/index.html">547 U. S. 370</a>, 378 (2006) (quoting <em>Beecham </em>v<em>. United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a>, 371 (1994)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An interpretation of the opposition clause that protects conduct that is not active and purposive would have important practical implications.  It would open the door to retaliation claims by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers.  To be sure, in many cases, such employees would not be able to show that management was aware of their opposition and thus would not be able to show that their opposition caused the adverse actions at issue.  But in other cases, such employees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue on the question of causation.  Suppose, for example, that an employee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while informally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbial water cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that was overheard by a co-worker.  Or suppose that an employee alleges that such a conversation occurred after work at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workers or at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relative of a supervisor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some courts hold that an employee asserting a retaliation claim can prove causation simply by showing that the adverse employment action occurred within a short time after the protected conduct.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Clark County School Dist</em>.<em> </em>v.<em> Breeden, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/268/index.html">532 U. S. 268</a>, 273 (2001) <em>(per curiam)</em> (noting that some cases \xe2\x80\x9caccept mere temporal proximity between an employer\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case\xe2\x80\x9d); see also<em>\nGorman-Bakos</em> v. <em>Cornell Cooperative Extension of Schenectady Cty</em>., 252 F.\xc2\xa03d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); <em>Conner</em> v. <em>Schnuk Markets, Inc.</em>, 121 F.\xc2\xa03d 1390, 1395 (CA10 1997);<em> Dey </em>v. <em>Colt Constr. &amp; Dev. Co</em>., 28 F.\xc2\xa03d 1446, 1458 (CA7 1994).  As a result, an employee claiming retaliation may be able to establish causation simply by showing that, within some time period prior to the adverse action, the employer, by some indirect means, became aware of the views that the employee had expressed.  Where the protected conduct consisted of a private conversation, application of this rule would be especially problematic because of uncertainty regarding the point in time when the employer became aware of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s private expressions of disapproval.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC has proliferated in recent years.  See U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:\nFY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/\ncharges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY 1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited Jan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOC doubled between 1992 and 2007).  An expansive interpretation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause this trend to accelerate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question whether the opposition clause shields employees who do not communicate their views to their employers through purposive conduct is not before us in this case; the answer to that question is far from clear; and I do not understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding to reach that issue here.  For present purposes, it is enough to hold that the opposition clause does protect an employee, like petitioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal investigation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
