Because Menon resided in Canada, Water Splash obtained permission to effect service by mail.  After Menon declined to answer or otherwise enter an appearance, the trial court issued a default judgment for Water Splash.  That court subsequently denied Menon\xe2\x80\x99s motion to set aside the judgment on the ground that she had not been properly served.  On appeal, Menon argued that service by mail does not comport with the requirements of the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters (Hague Service Convention), which seeks to simplify, standardize, and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad, specifying certain approved methods of service and preempting \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent methods of service\xe2\x80\x9d wherever it applies, <i>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft </i>v. <i>Schlunk</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 694\n.  The Texas Court of Appeals agreed with Menon, holding that the Convention prohibited service of process by mail.  Article 10, the provision at issue, consists of Articles 10(b) and 10(c), which plainly address permissible methods of \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and Article 10(a), which provides that the Convention will not interfere with \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d but does not expressly refer to \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Hague Service Convention does not prohibit service of process by mail.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0This Court begins its analysis by looking to the treaty\xe2\x80\x99s text and the context in which its words are used.  See <i>Schlunk</i>, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 699.  The key word in Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a broad term, and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for the purpose of service.  The structure of the Convention strongly counsels against such an exclusion.  The Convention\xe2\x80\x99s preamble and Article 1 limit the scope of the Convention to service of documents abroad, and its full title includes the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cService Abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has also held that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  <i>Id.,</i> at 701.  It would thus be quite strange if Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x94apparently alone among the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s provisions\xe2\x80\x94concerned something other than service of documents.  Indeed, such a reading would render Article 10(a) superfluous.  Article 10\xe2\x80\x99s function is to ensure that, generally, the Convention \xe2\x80\x9cshall not interfere\xe2\x80\x9d with the activities described in 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c).  But since Article 1 already \xe2\x80\x9celiminates [the] possibility\xe2\x80\x9d that the Convention would apply to any communications that \xe2\x80\x9cdo not culminate in service,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 701, in order for Article 10(a) to do any work, it <i>must </i>pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.  Menon\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that Article 10(a) applies not to <i>service of process</i> but only to the service of \xe2\x80\x9cpost-answer judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d lacks any plausible textual footing in Article 10.  If the drafters wished to limit Article 10(a) to a particular subset of documents, they could have said so\xe2\x80\x94as they did, <i>e.g.</i>, in Article 15, which refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca writ of summons or an equivalent document.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, Article 10(a) uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the same term featured in 10(b) and 10(c).  And the ordinary meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d is broad enough to cover the transmission of <i>any </i>judicial documents.  Accordingly, the text and structure of the Convention indicate that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The main counterargument\xe2\x80\x94that Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9csend judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d should mean something different than the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ceffect service of judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d in Article 10(b) and Article 10(c)\xe2\x80\x94is unpersuasive.  First, it must contend with the compelling structural considerations strongly suggesting that Article 10(a) pertains to service of documents.  Second, reading the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d as a broad concept that includes, but is not limited to, service is probably <i>more </i>plausible than interpreting the word to exclude service, and it does not create the same superfluity problem.  Third, the French version of the Convention, which is \xe2\x80\x9cequally authentic\xe2\x80\x9d to the English version, <i>Schlunk</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 699, uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cadresser,\xe2\x80\x9d which has consistently been understood to mean service or notice.  At best, Menon\xe2\x80\x99s argument creates an ambiguity as to Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  The Court thus turns to additional tools of treaty interpretation, which comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in Water Splash\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  First, the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history strongly suggests that the drafters understood that service by postal channels was permissible.  Second, in the half-century since the Convention was adopted, the Executive Branch has consistently maintained that the Hague Service Convention allows service by mail.  Finally, other signatories to the Convention have consistently adopted Water Splash\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The fact that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail does not mean that it affirmatively authorizes such service.  Rather, service by mail is permissible if the receiving state has not objected to service by mail and if such service is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.  Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the Convention prohibited service by mail, it did not consider whether Texas law authorizes the methods of service used by Water Splash.  That and any other remaining issues are left to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.

When a central authority receives an appropriate request, it must serve the documents or arrange for their service, Art. 5, and then provide a certificate of service, Art. 6.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Submitting a request to a central authority is not, however, the only method of service approved by the Convention.  For example, Article 8 permits service through diplomatic and consular agents; Article 11 provides that any two states can agree to methods of service not otherwise specified in the Convention; and Article 19 clarifies that the Convention does not preempt any internal laws of its signatories that permit service from abroad via methods not otherwise allowed by the Convention.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At issue in this case is Article 10 of the Convention, the English text of which reads as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cProvided the State of destination does not object, the present Convention shall not interfere with\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(b) the freedom of judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination,</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(c) the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0T., at 363.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Articles 10(b) and 10(c), by their plain terms, address additional methods of service that are permitted by the Convention (unless the receiving state objects).  By contrast, Article 10(a) does not expressly refer to \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question in this case is whether, despite this textual difference, the Article 10(a) phrase \xe2\x80\x9csend judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses sending documents <i>for the purposes of service</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In interpreting treaties, \xe2\x80\x9cwe begin with the text of the treaty and the context in which the written words are used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schlunk</i>, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 699 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For present purposes, the key word in Article 10(a) is \xe2\x80\x9csend.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is a broad term,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for a particular purpose (namely, service).  Moreover, the structure of the Hague Service Convention strongly counsels against such a reading.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The key structural point is that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  Several elements of the Convention indicate as much.  First, the preamble states that the Convention is intended \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure that judicial and extrajudicial documents <i>to be served abroad </i>shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in sufficient time.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  And Article 1 defines the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s scope by stating that the Convention \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document <i>for service abroad</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Even the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s full title reflects that the Convention concerns \xe2\x80\x9cService Abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have also held as much.  <i>Schlunk</i>, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 701 (stating that the Convention \xe2\x80\x9capplies only<i> </i>to documents transmitted for service abroad\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we explained, a preliminary draft of Article 1 was criticized \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it suggested that the Convention could apply to transmissions abroad that do not culminate in service.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The final version of Article 1, however, \xe2\x80\x9celiminates this possibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i> The wording of Article 1 makes clear that the Convention \xe2\x80\x9capplies only<i> </i>when there is both transmission of a document from the requesting state to the receiving state, and service upon the person for whom it is intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the text of the Convention reveals, and we have explicitly held, that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  In light of that, it would be quite strange if Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x94apparently alone among the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s provisions\xe2\x80\x94concerned something other than service of documents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, under that reading, Article 10(a) would be superfluous.  The function of Article 10 is to ensure that, absent objection from the receiving state, the Convention \xe2\x80\x9cshall not interfere\xe2\x80\x9d with the activities described in 10(a), 10(b) and 10(c).  But Article 1 already \xe2\x80\x9celiminates [the] possibility\xe2\x80\x9d that the Convention would apply to any communications that \xe2\x80\x9cdo not culminate in service,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 701, so it is hard to imagine how the Convention could interfere with any non-service communications.  Accordingly, in order for Article 10(a) to do any work, it <i>must </i>pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Menon attempts to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that Article 10(a) does<i> </i>refer to serving documents\xe2\x80\x94but only <i>some </i>documents.  Specifically, she makes a distinction between two categories of service.  According to Menon, Article 10(a) does not<i> </i>apply to <i>service of process</i> (which we have defined as \xe2\x80\x9ca formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 700)).  But Article 10(a) does apply, Menon suggests, to the service of \xe2\x80\x9cpost-answer judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, any additional documents which may have to be served later in the litigation).  Brief for Respondent 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  The problem with this argument is that it lacks any plausible textual footing in Article 10.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the drafters wished to limit Article 10(a) to a particular subset of documents, they presumably would have said so\xe2\x80\x94as they did, for example, in Article 15, which refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca writ of summons or an equivalent document.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, Article 10(a) uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the same term that is featured in 10(b) and 10(c).  Accord-ingly, the notion that Article 10(a) governs a different set of documents than 10(b) or 10(c) is hard to fathom.  And it certainly derives no support from the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9csend,\xe2\x80\x9d whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the transmission of <i>any </i>judicial documents (including litigation-initiating documents).  Nothing about the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that Article 10(a) is <i>narrower </i>than 10(b) and 10(c), let alone that Article 10(a) is somehow limited to \xe2\x80\x9cpost-answer\xe2\x80\x9d documents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, Menon wishes to read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csend judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cserve a subset of judicial documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is an entirely atextual reading, and Menon offers no sustained argument in support of it.  Therefore, the only way to escape the conclusion that Article 10(a) includes service of process is to assert that it does not cover service of documents at all\xe2\x80\x94and, as shown above, that reading is structurally implausible and renders Article 10(a) superfluous.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text and structure of the Hague Service Convention, then, strongly suggest that Article 10(a) pertains to service of documents.  The only significant counterargument is that, unlike many other provisions in the Convention, Article 10(a) does not include the word \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d or any of its variants.  The Article 10(a) phrase \xe2\x80\x9csend judicial documents,\xe2\x80\x9d the argument goes, should mean something different than the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ceffect service of judicial documents\xe2\x80\x9d in the other two subparts of Article 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument does not win the day for several reasons.  First, it must contend with the compelling structural considerations discussed above.  See <i>Air France </i>v. <i>Saks</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 392,\n397 (1985)\n (treaty interpretation must take account of the \xe2\x80\x9ccontext in which the written words are used\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center</i> v. <i>Nassar</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13) (\xe2\x80\x9cJust as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too are its structural choices\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the argument fails on its own terms.  Assume for a second that the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d must mean something other than \xe2\x80\x9cserve.\xe2\x80\x9d  That would not imply that Article 10(a) must <i>exclude </i>service.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9csend[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d could be a broader concept that includes service but is not limited to it.  That reading of the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d is probably <i>more </i>plausible than interpreting it to exclude service, and it does not create the same superfluity problem.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, it must be remembered that the French version of the Convention is \xe2\x80\x9cequally authentic\xe2\x80\x9d to the English version.  <i>Schlunk</i>, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 699.  Menon does not seri-ously engage with the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s French text.  But the word \xe2\x80\x9cadresser\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the French counterpart to the word \xe2\x80\x9csend\xe2\x80\x9d in Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas been consistently interpreted as meaning service or notice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hague Conference on Private Int\xe2\x80\x99l Law, Practical Handbook on the Operation of the Service Convention \xc2\xb6279, p. 91 (4th ed. 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the most that could possibly be said for this argument is that it creates an ambiguity as to Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  And when a treaty provision is ambiguous, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cmay look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schlunk</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As discussed below, these traditional tools of treaty interpretation comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in Water Splash\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining Article 10(a)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning: the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history, the views of the Executive, and the views of other signatories.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Drafting history has often been used in treaty interpretation.  See <i>Medell\xc3\xadn </i>v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491,\n507 (2008)\n; <i>Saks</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 400; see also <i>Schlunk</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 700 (analyzing the negotiating history of the Hague Service Convention).  Here, the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history strongly suggests that Article 10(a) allows service through postal channels.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Philip W. Amram was the member of the United States delegation who was most closely involved in the drafting of the Convention.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 6, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (App.) (1967) (S. Exec. Rep.) (statement of State Department Deputy Legal Adviser Richard D. Kearney).  A few months before the Convention was signed, he published an article describing and summarizing it.  In that article, he stated that \xe2\x80\x9cArticle 10 permits direct service by mail .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless [the receiving] state objects to such service.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Proposed International Convention on the Service of Documents Abroad, 51 A.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0J. 650, 653 (1965).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Along similar lines, the Rapporteur\xe2\x80\x99s report on a draft version of Article 10\xe2\x80\x94which did not materially differ from the final version\xe2\x80\x94stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cprovision of paragraph 1 also permits service .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by telegram\xe2\x80\x9d and that the drafters \xe2\x80\x9cdid not accept the proposal that postal channels be limited to registered mail.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Ristau \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x935(a), at 149.  In other words, it was clearly understood that service by postal channels was permissible, and the only question was whether it should be limited to registered mail.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court also gives \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of a treaty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott </i>v. <i>Abbott</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n15 (2010)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the half century since the Convention was adopted, the Executive has consistently maintained that the Hague Service Convention allows service by mail.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When President Johnson transmitted the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent, he included a report by Secretary of State Dean Rusk.  That report stated that \xe2\x80\x9cArticle 10 permits direct service by mail .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless [the receiving] state objects to such service.\xe2\x80\x9d  Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Message From the President of the United States, S. Exec. Doc. C, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1967).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1989, the Eighth Circuit issued <i>Bankston, </i>the first Federal Court of Appeals decision holding that the Hague Service Convention prohibits service by mail.  889 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 174.  The State Department expressed its disagreement with <i>Bankston </i>in a letter addressed to the Administrative Office of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Courts and the National Center for State Courts.  See Notice of Other Documents (1), United States Department of State Opinion Regarding the <i>Bankston</i> Case and Service by Mail to Japan Under the Hague Service Convention, 30 I.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0M. 260, 260\xe2\x80\x93261 (1991) (excerpts of Mar. 14, 1990, letter).  The letter stated that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Bankston </i>is incorrect to the extent that it suggests that the Hague Convention does not permit as a method of service of process the sending of a copy of a summons and complaint by registered mail to a defendant in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 261.  The State Department takes the same position on its website.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, this Court has given \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable weight\xe2\x80\x9d to the views of other parties to a treaty.  <i>Abbott</i>, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>Lozano</i> v. <i>Montoya Alvarez</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9) (noting the importance of \xe2\x80\x9cread[ing] the treaty in a manner consistent with the <i>shared</i> expectations of the contracting parties\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And other signatories to the Convention have consistently adopted Water Splash\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Multiple foreign courts have held that the Hague Service Convention allows for service by mail.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  In addition, several of the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s signatories have either objected, or declined to object, to service by mail under Article 10, thereby acknowledging that Article 10 encompasses service by mail.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Finally, several Special Commissions\xe2\x80\x94comprising numerous contracting States\xe2\x80\x94have expressly stated that the Convention does not prohibit service by mail.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  By contrast, Menon identifies no evidence that any signatory has ever rejected Water Splash\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In short, the traditional tools of treaty interpretation unmistakably demonstrate that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail.  To be clear, this does not mean that the Convention affirmatively <i>authorizes </i>service by mail.  Article 10(a) simply provides that, as long as the receiving state does not object, the Convention does not \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the freedom\xe2\x80\x9d to serve documents through postal channels.  In other words, in cases governed by the Hague Service Convention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met: first, the receiving state has not objected to service by mail; and second, service by mail is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.  See <i>Brockmeyer</i>, 383 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 803\xe2\x80\x93804.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the Convention prohibited service by mail outright, it had no occasion to consider whether Texas law authorizes the methods of service used by Water Splash.  We leave that question, and any other remaining issues, to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1568 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \xe2\x80\x9csend,\xe2\x80\x9d in part, as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o cause to be moved or conveyed from a present location to another place; esp., to deposit (a writing or notice) in the mail\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The argument also assumes that the scope of the Convention is not limited to service of process (otherwise, Article 10(a) would be superfluous even under Menon\xe2\x80\x99s reading).  <i>Schlunk </i>can be read to suggest that this assumption is wrong.  486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 700\xe2\x80\x93701; see 1 B.
