And it was argued by Ingersoll, for the Lessor of the Plaintiff, and by Duncan and C. Smith, for the Defendant. </p><p> For the Lessor of the Plaintiff. The special warranty shows the intention of the party; it secures the grantee against any previous incumbrances by the grantor, and against persons claiming under him, his heirs, or assigns; but there is no covenant, not even a declaration, that he is seized in fee; and, in effect, he simply conveys his own right, whatever that may be A freehold, though not a fee, may be made descendible to heirs and the nature of the conveyance under the statutes, and with the clause of warranty under the act of Assembly (1 Vol.111.Dall. edit.) conveys only such estate as the vendor might lawfully part with. If a tenant for his own life aliens by feoffment, or fine, for the life of another, or in tail, or in fee, it is a forfeiture; 2 Black. Com. 274. Co. Litt. 251. Litt. s. 415. but the reason is, that such an alienation tends to defeat and divest the remainder. In a feoffment, by the word Dedi, since the statute Quia Emptores, the feoff only is bound to the implied warranty; and in other forms of alienation, no warrant whatsoever is implied. 2 Bl. C. 300. 1. Co. Litt. 384. Co. Litt. 102. Litt. s. 733. The present deed is a bargain and sale; a contract to convey for a valuable consideration; 2 Bl. Com. 338. and it has its force and operation by the statute of uses. 2 Bl. Com. 327. 337. The force and operation of the words \'grant, bargain, and sell,\' under the act of Assembly, (1 Vol. 111. Dall. edit.) do not apply where a special warranty is introduced into the deed, and the previous section of the act only gives to deeds acknowledged and recorded the effect of a feoffment, or a deed inrolled in England, to perfect the title and seisen of the grantee; a mere bargain and sale not being before so strong a conveyance, as livery. Shep. T. 219.n. (I.) </p><p> For the Defendant. The act of Assembly declares, that deeds recorded shall be of the same force and effect here, for the giving possession and seisen, and making good the title and assurance of lands, tenements and hereditaments, as deeds of Feoffment with livery of seisen, or deeds enrolled in any of the Courts of record at Westminster, are or shall be in the kingdom of Great Britain. 1 Vol. p. 111. Dall. edit. The present deed is, therefore, an absolute and efficient conveyance in fee, whereas the grantor had only an estate for life, as tenant by the curtesy, in the premises. But if tenant for life, or years, conveys a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 3 U.S. 486, 489</a></p><p> greater estate, than he can lawfully do, whereby the reversion, or remainder is divested, it will be a forfeiture of his estate, as if he makes a feoffment. Co. Litt. 251.a.b. The law is the same in the case of an alienation by a tenant by the curtesy. Ibid. 252. a. The recording a deed is made, by the act of Assembly, equal in solemnity to livery of seisen, as public and notorious, and as operative to pass and vest the estate. So, if tenant for life bargains and sells his lands by deed enrolled, although no fee passes, yet it is a forfeiture, and that by reason of the enrollment, which is matter of record. 2 Leon. 64. 5. In Pennsylvania, the deed on record is itself a record, and a copy of it is evidence. So, if a tenant for years make a feoffment, it is a forfeiture of his estate; 3 Mod. 151. and, when it is said, in the case cited, that if he makes a lease and release, though it is of the same operation, it will not amount to a forfeiture; the reason is assigned in 1 T. Rep. 744. that a lease and release is a lawful conveyance, and passes no more than a man may lawfully part with. 2 Bl. Com. 274. 5. The particular tenant, by granting a larger estate than his own, has, by his own act, determined and put an end to his original interest; and on such determination the next taker is entitled to enter regularly, as in his remainder, or reversion. The criterion of the forfeiture is the actual passing an estate, which the grantor has no right to pass, to the prejudice of him in remainder; it amounts to a disseisin. Feoffment without livery, is said to pass no interest, which is the reason why such a feoffment is not a forfeiture; but by the act of Assembly, a deed recorded is equal to a feoffment with livery; and it is the matter of record, that makes the forfeiture. Harg. Co. Litt. 59. a. n. (3.) </p><p> The Court stopped Ingersoll, when he was about to reply, and delivered their opinion as follows. </p><p></p><p> M\'Kean, Chief Justice. </p><p> We entertain no doubt on the present question. The Legislature has, at various periods, and on a variety of subjects, departed from feudal ceremonies and principles, in relation to the transfer and descent of property; but, in the present instance, the act of Assembly meant only to give to a grant of lands, a greater effect upon the estate, on recording the deed, than could previously have been enjoyed, without livery of seizen: It never contemplated that circumstance, as an instrument to work a forfeiture, on the common law doctrine of alienation by tenant for life, or years. </p><p></p><p> Shippen, Justice. </p><p> From the words of the act of Assembly, it is plain, I think, that the Legislature did not mean to work the forfeiture of a particular estate, by the provision for recording deeds. In allowing to deeds recorded the same force and effect, as feoffments with livery, the intention is expressly restricted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 3 U.S. 486, 490</a></p><p> to \'giving possession and seisen, and making good the title and assurance of lands, tenements, and hereditaments.\' It is, therefore, merely a facility and benefit extended to the grantee. </p><p> Yeates and Smith, Justices, concurred. </p><p> Judgment for the Plaintiff.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
