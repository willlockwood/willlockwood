Furthermore, the Attorney General of New York supports <i>Trietley </i>as an appropriate approach to deciding this case.</p><p>Pursuant to \xc2\xa7 414\'s empowerment of local school districts, the Board of Center Moriches Union Free School District (District) has issued rules and regulations with respect to the use of school property when not in use for school purposes. The rules allow only 2 of the 10 purposes authorized by \xc2\xa7 414: social, civic, or recreational uses (Rule 10) and use by political organizations if secured in compliance with \xc2\xa7 414 (Rule 8).

The brochure stated that the film series would discuss Dr. Dobson\'s views on the undermining influences of the media that could only be counterbalanced by returning to traditional, Christian family values instilled at an early stage. The brochure went on to describe the contents of each of the six parts of the series.3 The District denied the first application, saying</p><p>period one year beginning in the next month. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/959/381/">959 F.2d 381</a>, 383 (CA2 1992). Within a few days the District wrote petitioners that the application "requesting use of the high school for your Sunday services" was denied, citing both N. Y. Educ. Law \xc2\xa7 414 and the District\'s Rule 7 barring uses for religious purposes. The Church did not challenge this denial in the courts and the validity of this denial is not before us.</p><p>3 <i>"Turn Your Heart Toward Home </i>is available now in a series of six discussion-provoking films:</p><p>\'(1) A FATHER LOOKS BACK emphasizes how swiftly time passes and appeals to all parents to \'turn their hearts toward home\' during the allimportant child-rearing years. <i>(60 minutes.)</i></p><p>\'(2) POWER IN PARENTING: THE YOUNG CHILD begins by exploring the inherent nature of power, and offers many practical helps for facing the battlegrounds in child-rearing-bedtime, mealtime and other confrontations so familiar to parents.

The second application for permission to use school premises for showing the film series, which described it as a "Family oriented movie-from a Christian perspective," id., at 91, was denied using identical language.</p><p>The Church brought suit in the District Court, challenging the denial as a violation of the Freedom of Speech and Assembly Clauses, the Free Exercise Clause, and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As to each cause of action, the Church alleged that the actions were undertaken under color of state law, in violation of 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983. The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, rejecting all the Church\'s claims. With respect to the free-speech claim under the First Amendment, the District Court characterized the District\'s facilities as a "limited public forum." The court noted that the enumerated purposes for which \xc2\xa7 414 allowed access to school facilities did not include religious worship or instruction, that Rule 7 explicitly proscribes using school facilities for religious purposes, and that the Church had conceded that its showing of the film series would be for religious purposes. 770 F. Supp. 91, 92, 98-99 (EDNY 1991). The District Court stated that once a limited public forum is opened to a particular type of speech, selectively denying access to other activities of the same genre is forbidden. <i>Id., </i>at 99.

Supp. 1247, 1253 (1990).</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court "in all respects." <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/959/381/">959 F.2d 381</a>, 389 (CA2 1992). It held that the school property, when not in use for school purposes, was neither a traditional nor a designated public forum; rather, it was a limited public forum open only for designated purposes, a classification that "allows it to remain non-public except as to specified uses." <i>Id., </i>at 386. The court observed that exclusions in such a forum need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, <i>ibid., </i>and ruled that denying access to the Church for the purpose of showing its film did not violate this standard. Because the holding below was questionable under our decisions, we granted the petition for certiorari, 506 U.

It is also common ground that the District need not have permitted after-hours use of its property for any of the uses permitted by N. Y. Educ. Law \xc2\xa7 414. The District, however, did open its property for 2 of the 10 uses permitted by \xc2\xa7 414. The Church argued below that because under Rule 10 of the rules issued by the District, school property could be used for "social, civic, and recreational" purposes, the District had opened its property for such a wide variety of communicative purposes that restrictions on communicative uses of the property were subject to the same constitutional limitations as restrictions in traditional public forums such as parks and sidewalks. Hence, its view was that subject matter or speaker exclusions on District property were required to be justified by a compelling state interest and to be narrowly drawn to achieve that end. See <i>Perry, supra, </i>at 45; <i>Cornelius, supra, </i>at 800. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this submission, which is also presented to this Court. The argument has considerable force, for the District\'s property is heavily used by a wide variety of private organizations, including some that presented a "close question," which the Court of Appeals resolved in the District\'s favor, as to whether the District had in fact already opened its property for religious uses. 959 F. 2d, at 387.5 We need</p><p>5 In support of its case in the District Court, the Church presented the following sampling of the uses that had been permitted under Rule 10 in 1987 and 1988:</p><p>"A New Age religious group known as the \'Mind Center\' Southern Harmonize Gospel Singers</p><p>Salvation Army Youth Band</p><p>Hampton Council of Churches\' Billy Taylor Concert Center Moriches Co-op Nursery School\'s Quilting Bee Manorville Humane Society\'s Chinese Auction Moriches Bay Power Squadron</p><p>[Footnote 5 is continued on p. 392J</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="392">392</a></p><p>not rule on this issue, however, for even if the courts below were correct in this respect-and we shall assume for present purposes that they were-the judgment below must be reversed.</p><p>With respect to public property that is not a designated public forum open for indiscriminate public use for communicative purposes, we have said that "[c]ontrol over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in</p><p>Unkechaug Dance Group</p><p>Paul Gibson\'s Baseball Clinic Moriches Bay Civic Association</p><p>Moriches Chamber of Commerce\'s Town Fair Day Center Moriches Drama Club</p><p>Center Moriches Music Award Associations\' \'Amahl &amp; the Night Visitors\' Saint John\'s Track and Field Program</p><p>Girl Scouts of Suffolk [C]ounty</p><p>Cub Scouts Pack 23</p><p>Boy Scout Troop #414." 770 F.

The first item listed is particularly interesting and relevant to the issue before us. The District Court referred to this item as "a lecture series by the Mind Center, purportedly a New Age religious group." <i>Id., </i>at 93. The Court of Appeals described it as follows:</p><p>"The lecture series, \'Psychology and The Unknown,\' by Jerry Huck, was sponsored by the Center Moriches Free Public Library. The library\'s newsletter characterized Mr. Huck as a psychotherapist who would discuss such topics as parapsychology, transpersonal psychology, physics and metaphysics in his 4-night series of lectures. Mr. Huck testified that he lectured principally on parapsychology, which he defined by \'reference to the human unconscious, the mind, the unconscious emotional system or the body system.\' When asked whether his lecture involved matters of both a spiritual and a scientific nature, Mr. Huck responded: \'It was all science. Anything I speak on based on parapsychology, analytic, quantum physicists [sic].\' Although some incidental reference to religious matters apparently was made in the lectures, Mr. Huck himself characterized such matters as \'a fascinating sideline\' and \'not the purpose of the [lecture].\'\'\' 959 F. 2d, at 388.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="393">393</a></p><p>light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral." <i>Cornelius, </i>473 U. S., at 806, citing <i>Perry Education Assn., supra, </i>at 49. The Court of Appeals appeared to recognize that the total ban on using District property for religious purposes could survive First Amendment challenge only if excluding this category of speech was reasonable and viewpoint neutral. The court\'s conclusion in this case was that Rule 7 met this test. We cannot agree with this holding, for Rule 7 was unconstitutionally applied in this case.6</p><p>The Court of Appeals thought that the application of Rule 7 in this case was viewpoint neutral because it had been, and would be, applied in the same way to all uses of school property for religious purposes. That all religions and all uses for religious purposes are treated alike under Rule 7, however, does not answer the critical question whether it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.</p><p>There is no suggestion from the courts below or from the District or the State that a lecture or film about child rearing and family values would not be a use for social or civic purposes otherwise permitted by Rule 10.

In our view, denial on that basis was plainly invalid under our holding in <i>Cornelius, supra, </i>at 806, that</p><blockquote><p>\n"[a]lthough a speaker may be excluded from a nonpublic forum if he wishes to address a topic not encompassed within the purpose of the forum ... or if he is not a member of the class of speakers for whose especial benefit the forum was created ... , the government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject."</p></blockquote><p>The film series involved here no doubt dealt with a subject otherwise permissible under Rule 10, and its exhibition was denied solely because the series dealt with the subject from a religious standpoint. The principle that has emerged from our cases "is that the First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others." <i>City Council of Los Angeles </i>v. <i>Taxpayers for Vincent, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html">466 U. S. 789</a>, 804 (1984). That principle applies in the circumstances of this case; as Judge Posner said for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, to discriminate "against a particular point of view ... would ... flunk the test ... [of] <i>Cornelius, </i>provided that the defendants have no defense based on the establishment clause." <i>May </i>v. <i>Evansville- Vanderburgh School Corp., 787</i></p><p>The District, as a respondent, would save its judgment below on the ground that to permit its property to be used for religious purposes would be an establishment of religion forbidden by the First Amendment.

S. 263</a>, 271 (1981), that the interest of the State in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation "may be [a] compelling" one justifying an abridgment of free speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment; but the Court went on to hold that permitting use of univer-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="395">395</a></p><p>sity property for religious purposes under the open access policy involved there would not be incompatible with the Court\'s Establishment Clause cases.</p><p>We have no more trouble than did the <i>Widmar </i>Court in disposing of the claimed defense on the ground that the posited fears of an Establishment Clause violation are unfounded. The showing of this film series would not have been during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members. The District property had repeatedly been used by a wide variety of private organizations. Under these circumstances, as in <i>Widmar, </i>there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit to religion or to the Church would have been no more than incidental. As in <i>Widmar, supra, </i>at 271-272, permitting District property to be used to exhibit the film series involved in this case would not have been an establishment of religion under the three-part test articulated in <i>Lemon </i>v. <i>Kurtzman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971): The challenged governmental action has a secular purpose, does not have the principal or primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, and does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.7</p><p>The District also submits that it justifiably denied use of its property to a "radical" church for the purpose of proselytizing, since to do so would lead to threats of public unrest and even violence.

There is nothing in the record to support such a justification, which in any event would be difficult to defend as a reason to deny the presentation of a religious point of view about a subject the District otherwise opens to discussion on District property.</p><p>We note that the New York State Attorney General, a respondent here, does not rely on either the Establishment Clause or possible danger to the public peace in supporting the judgment below. Rather, he submits that the exclusion is justified because the purpose of the access rules is to promote the interests of the public in general rather than sectarian or other private interests. In light of the variety of the uses of District property that have been permitted under Rule 10, this approach has its difficulties. This is particularly so since Rule 10 states that District property may be used for social, civic, or recreational use "only if it can be non-exclusive and open to all residents of the school district that form a homogeneous group deemed relevant to the event." App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. At least arguably, the Rule does not require that permitted uses need be open to the public at large. However that may be, this was not the basis of the judgment that we are reviewing. The Court of Appeals, as we understand it, ruled that because the District had the power to permit or exclude certain subject matters, it was entitled to deny use for any religious purpose, including the purpose in this case. The Attorney General also defends this as a permissible subject-matter exclusion rather than a denial based on viewpoint, a submission that we have already rejected.</p><p>The Attorney General also argues that there is no express finding below that the Church\'s application would have been granted absent the religious connection.

The same can be said of the Court\'s use of the phrase "endorsing religion," see <i>ante, </i>at 395, which, as I have indicated elsewhere, cannot suffice as a rule of decision consistent with our precedents and our traditions in this part of our jurisprudence.

Over the years, however, no fewer than five of the currently sitting Justices have, in their own opinions, personally driven pencils through the creature\'s heart (the author of today\'s opinion repeatedly), and a sixth has joined an opinion doing so.

It is there to scare us (and our audience) when we wish it to do so, but we can command it to return to the tomb at will. See, <i>e. g., Lynch </i>v. <i>Donnelly, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/case.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 679 (1984) (noting instances in which Court has not applied <i>Lemon </i>test). When we wish to strike down a practice it forbids, we invoke it, see, <i>e. g., Aguilar </i>v. <i>Felton, 473 </i>U. S. 402 (1985) (striking down state remedial education program administered in part in parochial schools); when we wish to uphold a practice it forbids, we ignore it entirely, see <i>Marsh </i>v. <i>Chambers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/case.html">463 U. S. 783</a> (1983) (upholding state legislative chaplains).

Such a docile and useful monster is worth keeping around, at least in a somnolent state; one never knows when one might need him.</p><p>For my part, I agree with the long list of constitutional scholars who have criticized <i>Lemon </i>and bemoaned the strange Establishment Clause geometry of crooked lines and wavering shapes its intermittent use has produced. See, <i>e. </i>g., Choper, The Establishment Clause and Aid to Parochial Schools-An Update, 75 Calif. L.

What a strange notion, that a Constitution which <i>itself </i>gives "religion in general" preferential treatment (I refer to the Free Exercise Clause) forbids endorsement of religion in general. The attorney general of New York not only agrees with that strange notion, he has an explanation for it: "Religious advocacy," he writes, "serves the community only in the eyes of its adherents and yields a benefit only to those who already believe." Brief for Respondent Attorney General 24. That was <i>not </i>the view of those who adopted our Constitution, who believed that the public virtues inculcated by religion are a public good. It suffices to point out that during the summer of 1789, when it was in the process of drafting the First Amendment, Congress enacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance that the Confederation Congress had adopted in 1787-Article III of which provides: "Religion, morality, and knowledge, <i>being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, </i>schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Unsurprisingly, then, indifference to "religion in general" is <i>not </i>what our cases, both old and recent, demand. See, <i>e. g., Zorach </i>v. <i>Clauson, 343 </i>U.

Lacking a majority at that time to abandon <i>Lemon, </i>we necessarily focused on that test, which had been the exclusive basis for the lower court\'s judgment. Here, of course, the lower court did not mention <i>Lemon, </i>and indeed did not even address any Establishment Clause argument on behalf of respondents.
