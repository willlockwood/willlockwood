The first question before us in these cases is whether the state statute, as applied to insurance policies purchased by employee health care plans regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, is preempted by that Act.  The second question is whether the state statute, as applied to insurance policies purchased pursuant to negotiated collective bargaining agreements regulated by the National Labor Relations Act, is preempted by the labor Act.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>General health insurance typically is sold as group insurance to an employer or other group. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Group insurance presently is subject to extensive state regulation, including </p><p><a class="page-number" name="728">Page 471 U. S. 728</a></p><p> regulation of the carrier, regulation of the sale and advertising of the insurance, and regulation of the content of the contracts. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Mandated benefit laws, that require an insurer to provide a certain kind of benefit to cover a specified illness or procedure whenever someone purchases a certain kind of insurance, are a subclass of such content regulation.</p>\n<p>While mandated benefit statutes are a relatively recent phenomenon, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] statutes regulating the substantive terms of insurance contracts have become commonplace in all 50 States over the last 30 years. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Perhaps the most familiar are those regulating the content of automobile insurance policies. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="729">Page 471 U. S. 729</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The substantive terms of group health insurance contracts, in particular, also have been extensively regulated by the States.  For example, the majority of States currently require that coverage for dependents continue beyond any contractually imposed age limitation when the dependent is incapable of self-sustaining employment because of mental or physical handicap; such statutes date back to the early 1960\'s. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  And over the last 15 years, all 50 States have required that coverage of infants begin at birth, rather than at some time shortly after birth, as had been the prior practice in the unregulated market. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Many state statutes require that insurers offer on an optional basis particular kinds of coverage to purchasers. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Others require insurers either to offer or mandate that insurance policies include coverage for services rendered by a particular type of health care provider. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Mandated benefit statutes, then, are only one variety of a matrix of state laws that regulate the substantive content of health insurance policies to further state health policy.  Massachusetts Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 175, \xc2\xa7 47B (West Supp.1985), is typical of mandated benefit laws currently in place in the majority of States. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  With respect to a Massachusetts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="730">Page 471 U. S. 730</a></p><p> resident, it requires any general health insurance policy that provides hospital and surgical coverage, or any benefit plan that has such coverage, to provide as well a certain minimum of mental health protection.  In particular, \xc2\xa7 47B requires that a health insurance policy provide 60 days of coverage for confinement in a mental hospital, coverage for confinement in a general hospital equal to that provided by the policy for nonmental illness, and certain minimum outpatient benefits. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="731">Page 471 U. S. 731</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Section 47B was designed to address problems encountered in treating mental illness in Massachusetts.  The Commonwealth determined that its working people needed to be protected against the high cost of treatment for such illness.  It also believed that, without insurance, mentally ill workers were often institutionalized in large state mental hospitals, and that mandatory insurance would lead to a higher incidence of more effective treatment in private community mental health centers.  <em>See</em> Massachusetts General Court, Joint Committee on Insurance, Advances in Health Insurance in Massachusetts (1974), reprinted in App. 426, 430-432.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Commonwealth concluded that the voluntary insurance market was not adequately providing mental health coverage, because of "adverse selection" in mental health insurance:  good insurance risks were not purchasing coverage, and this drove up the price of coverage for those who otherwise might purchase mental health insurance.  The legislature believed that the public interest required that it correct the insurance market in the Commonwealth by mandating minimum coverage levels, effectively forcing the good-risk individuals to become part of the risk pool, and enabling insurers to price the insurance at an average market, rather than a market retracted due to adverse selection.  <em>See</em> Findings of Fact of the Superior Court, App. to Juris.Statement in No. 84-325, pp. 50a-53a.  Section 47B, then, was intended to help safeguard the public against the high costs of comprehensive inpatient and outpatient mental health care, reduce nonpsychiatric medical care expenditures for mentally related illness, shift the delivery of treatment from inpatient to outpatient services, and relieve the Commonwealth of some of the financial burden it otherwise would encounter with respect to mental health problems.  <em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="732">Page 471 U. S. 732</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is our task in these cases to decide whether such insurance regulation violates or is inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1001 <em>et seq.</em> (ERISA), comprehensively regulates employee pension and welfare plans.  An employee welfare benefit plan or welfare plan is defined as one which provides to employees "medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability [or] death," whether these benefits are provided "through the purchase of insurance or otherwise."  \xc2\xa7 3(1), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1002(1).  Plans may self-insure or they may purchase insurance for their participants.  Plans that purchase insurance -- so-called "insured plans" -- are directly affected by state laws that regulate the insurance industry.</p>\n<p>ERISA imposes upon pension plans a variety of substantive requirements relating to participation, funding, and vesting.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 201-306, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1051-1086.  It also establishes various uniform procedural standards concerning reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibility for both pension and welfare plans.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 101-111, 401-414, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1021-1031, 1101-1114.  It does not regulate the substantive content of welfare benefit plans.  <em>See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html">463 U. S. 85</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#91">463 U. S. 91</a></span> (1983).</p>\n<p>ERISA thus contains almost no federal regulation of the terms of benefit plans.  It does, however, contain a broad preemption provision declaring that the statute shall "supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan."  \xc2\xa7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(a).  Appellant Metropolitan in No. 84-325 argues that ERISA preempts Massachusetts\' mandated benefit law insofar as \xc2\xa7 47B restricts the kinds of insurance policies that benefit plans may purchase. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 471 U. S. 733</a></p><p></p>\n<p>While \xc2\xa7 514(a) of ERISA broadly preempts state laws that relate to an employee benefit plan, that preemption is substantially qualified by an "insurance saving clause," \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A), which broadly states that, with one exception, nothing in ERISA "shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities."  The specified exception to the saving clause is found in \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(B), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(B), the so-called "deemer clause," which states that no employee benefit plan, with certain exceptions not relevant here,</p>\n<p>"shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer, bank, trust company, or investment company or to be engaged in the business of insurance or banking for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks, trust companies, or investment companies."</p>\n<p>Massachusetts argues that its mandated benefit law, as applied to insurance companies that sell insurance to benefit plans, is a "law which regulates insurance," and therefore is saved from the effect of the general preemption clause of ERISA.</p>\n<p>Wholly apart from the question whether Massachusetts\' mandated benefit law is preempted by ERISA, appellant Travelers in No. 84-356 argues that, as applied to benefit plans negotiated pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, \xc2\xa7 47B is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151 <em>et seq.</em> (NLRA), because it effectively imposes a contract term on the parties that otherwise would be a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.  Unlike ERISA, the NLRA contains no statutory provision indicating the extent to which it was intended to preempt state law.  Resolution of the NLRA preemption question, therefore, requires us to discern legislative intent from the general purpose of the NLRA, and not from any particular statutory language. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="734">Page 471 U. S. 734</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellants are Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Travelers Insurance Company (insurers) who are located in New York and Connecticut, respectively, and who issue group health policies providing hospital and surgical coverage to plans, or to employers or unions that employ or represent employees residing in Massachusetts.  Under the terms of \xc2\xa7 47B, both appellants are required to provide minimal mental health benefits in policies issued to cover Commonwealth residents.</p>\n<p>In 1979, the Attorney General of Massachusetts brought suit in Massachusetts Superior Court for declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce \xc2\xa7 47B.  The Commonwealth asserted that, since January 1, 1976, the effective date of \xc2\xa7 47B, the insurers had issued policies to group policyholders situated outside Massachusetts that provided for hospital and surgical coverage for certain residents of the Commonwealth.  App. 8-9.  It further asserted that those policies failed to provide Massachusetts resident beneficiaries the mental health coverage mandated by \xc2\xa7 47B, and that the insurers intended to issue more such policies, believing themselves not bound by \xc2\xa7 47B for policies issued outside the Commonwealth.  In their answer, the insurers admitted these allegations. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint further asserted that the insurers had amended a number of policies in effect prior to January 1, 1976, but had failed to include the benefits mandated by \xc2\xa7 47B in the amended policies, in violation of the law.  App. 9-10.  Finally, the Commonwealth asserted that the insurers refused to provide the mandated benefits in part on the ground that they believed ERISA and the NLRA preempted \xc2\xa7 47B.  App. 10.  Though the insurers had not actually refused to provide the mandated benefits in any policy issued after January 1, 1976, within the Commonwealth, the insurers preserved their right to challenge the applicability of \xc2\xa7 47B </p><p><a class="page-number" name="735">Page 471 U. S. 735</a></p><p> to any policy issued to an ERISA plan within the Commonwealth. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Commonwealth accordingly requested broad preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, asking the court to require the insurers to provide the mandated benefits to all covered residents of the Commonwealth subject to the terms of \xc2\xa7 47B, regardless of when their policies were issued or whether they were presently receiving such benefits.  App. 11-12.</p>\n<p>The Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the insurers to provide the coverage mandated by \xc2\xa7 47B.  App. 57-59.  After trial, a different judge issued a permanent injunction to the same effect, <em>see</em> App. to Juris.Statement in No. 84-325, pp. 67a-70a, making extensive findings of fact concerning the cost, nature, purpose, and effect of the mandated benefit law.  <em>See id.</em> at 36a-62a.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts granted the insurers\' application for direct appellate review and affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.  <em>Attorney General v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</em> 385 Mass. 598, 433 N.E.2d 1223 (1982).</p>\n<p>Addressing first the ERISA preemption question, the court recognized that \xc2\xa7 47B is a law that "<em>relate[s] to\' benefit plans," and so would be preempted unless it fell within one of the exceptions to the preemption clause of ERISA.  385 Mass. at 605, 433 N.E.2d at 1227.  The court went on to hold, however, that \xc2\xa7 47B is a law "which regulates insurance," as understood by the ERISA saving clause, \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(b)(2)(A), and therefore is not preempted by ERISA.  385 Mass. at 606-609, 433 N.E.2d at 1228-1230.

The court nonetheless was wary of a literal reading of the statute, lest the saving clause give the States unintended authority to regulate in areas otherwise governed by ERISA.  It therefore understood the saving clause to save only state laws that were unrelated to the substantive provisions of ERISA.  Since nothing in ERISA regulates the content of welfare plans, state regulation of insurance that indirectly affects the content of welfare plans is not preempted by ERISA.  385 Mass. at 606-607, 609, 433 N.E.2d at 1228-1229.\n</em></p>\n<p>The court then went on to conclude that the NLRA does not preempt \xc2\xa7 47B.  Although \xc2\xa7 47B regulates health benefits, a subject of mandatory collective bargaining, the NLRA does not preempt all local regulation affecting employment relations.  A public health statute, \xc2\xa7 47B does not regulate labor-management relations as such, or affect the free play of economic forces between labor and management.</p>\n<p>"It is unlikely that Congress intended, by enacting the NLRA, to bind the hands of State Legislatures with respect to problems such as mental health."</p>\n<p>385 Mass. at 613, 433 N.E.2d at 1232.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the court pointed out, Congress has indicated in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011 <em>et seq.,</em> that federal laws should not be construed to supersede state laws "regulating the business of insurance."  \xc2\xa7 1012(b).  Section 47B operates upon insurance and insurance policies.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 471 U. S. 737</a></p><p> contains no limiting definition of the term "business of insurance" that would suggest a narrow reading excluding \xc2\xa7 47B from its protection.  385 Mass. at 613-614, 433 N.E.2d at 1232.  The court therefore found no preemption under either ERISA or the NLRA.</p>\n<p>On appeal, this Court, 463 U.S. 1221 (1983), vacated the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court and remanded the cases for further consideration in light of the intervening decision in <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html">463 U. S. 85</a></span> (1983).  Appropriately refocusing on the ERISA preemption provisions that were the subject of that decision, the Supreme Judicial Court, with one justice dissenting, reinstated its former judgment.  <em>Attorney General v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</em> 391 Mass. 730, 463 N.E.2d 548 (1984).  The court reasoned that this Court had not addressed the insurance exception in <em>Shaw,</em> and, as that decision construed none of the exceptions listed in \xc2\xa7 514(b), our statement that the exceptions were "narrow" was merely dictum that did not compel the Massachusetts court to change its result.  391 Mass. at 733, 463 N.E.2d at 550.  Unlike the exemption from ERISA coverage at issue in <em>Shaw,</em> the exception in \xc2\xa7 514(b) is phrased very broadly.  Nor was there reason to alter the limiting construction given the saving clause.  The Court in <em>Shaw</em> held that ERISA\'s broad preemption provision was intended to preempt any state law that "relate[d] to" an employee benefit plan, not merely those state laws that directly conflicted with a substantive provision in the federal statute.  Though the Court thus had rejected a conflict-based analysis of the broadly phrased preemption clause as being too narrow an interpretation of that provision, it did not follow that the conflict-based limitation on the saving clause imposed by the Supreme Judicial Court similarly should be rejected.</p>\n<p>The dissenting justice felt that the <em>Shaw</em> Court had made clear that the exemptions and exceptions to ERISA\'s preemption clause should be read narrowly in order to preserve nationwide uniformity in the administration of welfare plans.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 471 U.

The broad scope of the preemption clause was noted recently in <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra,</em> where we held that the New York Human Rights Law and that State\'s Disability Benefits Law "relate[d] to" welfare plans governed by ERISA.  The phrase "relate to" was given its broad common-sense meaning, such that a state law "relate[s] to" a benefit plan "in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan."  463 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/85/case.html#97">463 U.

The Commonwealth does not argue that \xc2\xa7 47B, as applied to policies purchased by benefit plans, does not relate to those plans, and we agree with the Supreme Judicial Court that the mandated benefit law, as applied, relates to ERISA plans, and thus is covered by ERISA\'s broad preemption provision set forth in \xc2\xa7 514(a).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the sphere in which \xc2\xa7 514(a) operates was explicitly limited by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2).  The insurance saving clause preserves any state law "which regulates insurance, banking, or securities."  The two preemption sections, while clear enough on their faces, perhaps are not a model of legislative drafting, for while the general preemption clause broadly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 471 U. S. 740</a></p><p> preempts state law, the saving clause appears broadly to preserve the States\' lawmaking power over much of the same regulation.  While Congress occasionally decides to return to the States what it has previously taken away, it does not normally do both at the same time. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Fully aware of this statutory complexity, we still have no choice but to</p>\n<p>"begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose."</p>\n<p><em>Park \'N Fly, Inc. v.

We also must presume that Congress did not intend to preempt areas of traditional state regulation.  <em>See Jones v.

This common-sense view of the matter, moreover, is reinforced by the language of the subsequent subsection of ERISA, the "deemer clause," which states that an employee benefit plan shall not be deemed to be an insurance company</p>\n<p>"for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies, <em>insurance contracts,</em> banks, trust companies, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 471 U.

By exempting from the saving clause laws regulating insurance contracts that apply directly to benefit plans, the deemer clause makes explicit Congress\' intention to include laws that regulate insurance contracts within the scope of the insurance laws preserved by the saving clause.  Unless Congress intended to include laws regulating insurance contracts within the scope of the insurance saving clause, it would have been unnecessary for the deemer clause explicitly to exempt such laws from the saving clause when they are applied directly to benefit plans.</p>\n<p>The insurers nonetheless argue that \xc2\xa7 47B is in reality a health law that merely operates on insurance contracts to accomplish its end, and that it is not the kind of traditional insurance law intended to be saved by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A).  We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>Initially, nothing in \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A), or in the "deemer clause" which modifies it, purports to distinguish between traditional and innovative insurance laws.  The presumption is against preemption, and we are not inclined to read limitations into federal statutes in order to enlarge their preemptive scope.  Further, there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress had such a distinction in mind.</p>\n<p>Appellants assert that state laws that directly regulate the insurer, and laws that regulate such matters as the way in which insurance may be sold, are traditional laws subject to the clause, while laws that regulate the substantive terms of insurance contracts are recent innovations more properly seen as health laws, rather than as insurance laws, which \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A) does not save.  This distinction reads the saving clause out of ERISA entirely, because laws that regulate only the insurer, or the way in which it may sell insurance, do not "relate to" benefit plans in the first instance.  Because they would not be preempted by \xc2\xa7 514(a), they do not need to be "saved" by \xc2\xa7 514(b)(2)(A).  There is no indication that Congress could have intended the saving clause to operate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="742">Page 471 U. S. 742</a></p><p> only to guard against too expansive readings of the general preemption clause that might have included laws wholly unrelated to plans. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Appellants\' construction, in our view, violates the plain meaning of the statutory language and renders redundant both the saving clause it is construing, as well as the deemer clause which it precedes, and accordingly has little to recommend it. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is both historically and conceptually inaccurate to assert that mandated benefit laws are not traditional insurance laws.  As we have indicated, state laws regulating the substantive terms of insurance contracts were commonplace well before the mid-70\'s, when Congress considered ERISA. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The case law concerning the meaning of the phrase "business of insurance" in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1011 <em>et seq.,</em> also strongly supports the conclusion that regulation regarding the substantive terms of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 471 U. S. 743</a></p><p> insurance contracts falls squarely within the saving clause as laws "which regulate insurance."</p>\n<p>Cases interpreting the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act have identified three criteria relevant to determining whether a particular practice falls within that Act\'s reference to the "business of insurance":</p>\n<p>"<em>first,</em> whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\'s risk; <em>second,</em> whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and <em>third,</em> whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry."</p>\n<p><em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/119/case.html">458 U.

S. 205</a></span> (1979).  Application of these principles suggests that mandated benefit laws are state regulation of the "business of insurance."</p>\n<p>Section 47B obviously regulates the spreading of risk:  as we have indicated, it was intended to effectuate the legislative judgment that the risk of mental health care should be shared.  <em>See</em> Findings of Fact of the Superior Court, App. to Juris.Statement in No. 84-325, pp. 50a-51a.  It is also evident that mandated benefit laws directly regulate an integral part of the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder by limiting the type of insurance that an insurer may sell to the policyholder.  Finally, the third criterion is present here, for mandated benefit statutes impose requirements only on insurers, with the intent of affecting the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder.  Section 47B, then, is the very kind of regulation that this Court has identified as a law that relates to the regulation of the business of insurance as defined in the McCarran-Ferguson Act: [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>"Congress was concerned [in the McCarran-Ferguson Act] with the type of state regulation that centers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 471 U. S. 744</a></p><p> around the contract of insurance. . . .  The relationship between insurer and insured, <em>the type of policy which could be issued,</em> its reliability, its interpretation, and enforcement -- these were the core of the \'business of insurance.\'  [T]he focus [of the statutory term] was on the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder.  Statutes aimed at protecting or regulating this relationship, directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the \'business of insurance.\'"</p>\n<p><em>SEC v.

S. 460</a></span> (1969) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Nor is there any contrary case authority suggesting that laws regulating the terms of insurance contracts should not be understood as laws that regulate insurance.  In short, the plain language of the saving clause, its relationship to the other ERISA preemption provisions, and the traditional understanding of insurance regulation, all lead us to the conclusion that mandated benefit laws such as \xc2\xa7 47B are saved from preemption by the operation of the saving clause. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 471 U. S. 745</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Nothing in the legislative history of ERISA suggests a different result.  There is no discussion in that history of the relationship between the general preemption clause and the saving clause, and indeed very little discussion of the saving clause at all. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In the early versions of ERISA, the general preemption clause preempted only those state laws dealing with subjects regulated by ERISA.  The clause was significantly broadened at the last minute, well after the saving clause was in its present form, to include all state laws that relate to benefit plans.  The change was made with little explanation by the Conference Committee, and there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress was aware of the new prominence given the saving clause in light of the rewritten preemption clause, or was aware that the saving clause was in conflict with the general preemption provision. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  There is a complete absence of evidence that Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 471 U. S. 746</a></p><p> intended the narrow reading of the saving clause suggested by appellants here.  Appellants do call to our attention a few passing references in the record of the floor debate to the "narrow" exceptions to the preemption clause, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] but these are far too frail a support on which to rest appellants\' rather unnatural reading of the clause.</p>\n<p>We therefore decline to impose any limitation on the saving clause beyond those Congress imposed in the clause itself and in the "deemer clause" which modifies it.  If a state law "regulates insurance," as mandated benefit laws do, it is not preempted.  Nothing in the language, structure, or legislative history of the Act supports a more narrow reading of the clause, whether it be the Supreme Judicial Court\'s attempt to save only state regulations unrelated to the substantive provisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 471 U. S. 747</a></p><p> of ERISA, or the insurers\' more speculative attempt to read the saving clause out of the statute.</p>\n<p>We are aware that our decision results in a distinction between insured and uninsured plans, leaving the former open to indirect regulation while the latter are not.  By so doing we merely give life to a distinction created by Congress in the "deemer clause," a distinction Congress is aware of and one it has chosen not to alter. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  We also are aware that appellants\' construction of the statute would eliminate some of the disuniformities currently facing national plans that enter into local markets to purchase insurance.  Such disuniformities, however, are the inevitable result of the congressional decision to "save" local insurance regulation.  Arguments as to the wisdom of these policy choices must be directed at Congress.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Unlike ERISA, the NLRA contains no statutory preemption provision.

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts correctly found that,</p>\n<p>"[b]ecause a plan that purchases insurance has no choice but to provide mental health care benefits, the insurance provisions of \xc2\xa7 47B effectively control the content of insured welfare benefit plans."</p>\n<p>385 Mass. at 605, 433 N.E.2d at 1227.  More precisely, faced with \xc2\xa7 47B, parties to a collective bargaining agreement providing for health insurance are forced to make a choice:  either they must purchase the mandated benefit, decide not to provide health coverage at all, or decide to become self-insured, assuming they are in a financial position to make that choice.</p>\n<p>The question then becomes whether this kind of interference with collective bargaining is forbidden by federal law.  Appellants argue that, because Congress intended to leave the choice of terms in collective bargaining agreements to the free play of economic forces, not subject either to state law or to the control of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), mandated benefit laws should be preempted by the NLRA.</p>\n<p>The Court has articulated two distinct NLRA preemption principles.  The so-called <em>Garmon</em> rule, <em>see San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span> (1959), protects the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB to determine in the first instance what kind of conduct is either prohibited or protected by the NLRA.

S. 749</a></p><p> Massachusetts has sought to regulate or prohibit any conduct subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the NLRB, since the Act is silent as to the substantive provisions of welfare benefit plans.</p>\n<p>A second preemption doctrine protects against state interference with policies implicated by the structure of the Act itself, by preempting state law and state causes of action concerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated.  The doctrine was designed, at least initially, to govern preemption questions that arose concerning activity that was neither arguably protected against employer interference by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7 and 8(a)(1) of the NLRA nor arguably prohibited as an unfair labor practice by \xc2\xa7 8(b) of that Act.  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 157, 158(a)(1) and (b).

Instead, appellants argue that not only did Congress establish a balance of bargaining power between labor and management in the Act, but it also intended to prevent the States from establishing minimum employment standards that labor and management would otherwise have been required to negotiate from their federally protected bargaining positions, and would otherwise have been permitted to set at a lower level than that mandated by state law.  Appellants assert that such state regulation is permissible only when Congress has authorized its enactment.  Because welfare benefits are a mandatory subject of bargaining under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 471 U. S. 752</a></p><p> labor law, <em>see Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers v.

[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellants assume that Congress\' ultimate concern in the NLRA was in leaving the parties free to reach agreement about contract terms.  The framework established in the NLRA was merely a means to allow the parties to reach such agreement fairly.  A law that interferes with the end result of bargaining is, therefore, even worse than a law that interferes with the bargaining process.  Thus, it is argued, this case is <em>a fortiori</em> to cases like <em>Morton, Machinists,</em> and <em>New York Telephone.</em></p>\n<p>The question has been before the Court in the past, <em>see Algoma Plywood Co. v.

Upon close analysis, however, we find that <em>Morton, Machinists,</em> and <em>New York Telephone</em> all rest on a sound understanding of the purpose and operation of the Act that is incompatible with appellants\' position here.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Congress apparently did not consider the question whether state laws of general application affecting terms of collective bargaining agreements subject to mandatory bargaining were to be preempted. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  That being so, "the Court must construe the Act and determine its impact on state law in light of the wider contours of federal labor policy."  <em>Belknap, Inc. v.

S. 520</a></span>, n. 4 (1983) (opinion concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The NLRA is concerned primarily with establishing an equitable process for determining terms and conditions of employment, and not with particular substantive terms of the bargain that is struck when the parties are negotiating from relatively equal positions.  <em>See</em> Cox, Recent Developments in Federal Labor Law Preemption, 41 Ohio St.L.J. 277, 297 (1980).  The NLRA\'s declared purpose is to remedy</p>\n<p>"[t]he inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151.  The same section notes the desirability of "restoring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 471 U.

Wagner), thought to be the cause of economic decline and depression. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Congress hoped to accomplish this by establishing procedures for more equitable private bargaining.</p>\n<p>The evil Congress was addressing thus was entirely unrelated to local or federal regulation establishing minimum terms of employment.  Neither inequality of bargaining power nor the resultant depressed wage rates were thought to result from the choice between having terms of employment set by public law or having them set by private agreement.  No incompatibility exists, therefore, between federal rules designed to restore the equality of bargaining power and state or federal legislation that imposes minimal substantive requirements on contract terms negotiated between parties to labor agreements, at least so long as the purpose of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="755">Page 471 U. S. 755</a></p><p> the state legislation is not incompatible with these general goals of the NLRA.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it never has been argued successfully that minimal labor standards imposed by other federal laws were not to apply to unionized employers and employees.  <em>See, e.g., Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html">450 U. S. 728</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#737">450 U.

Nor has Congress ever seen fit to exclude unionized workers and employers from laws establishing federal minimal employment standards.  We see no reason to believe that for this purpose Congress intended state minimum labor standards to be treated differently from minimum federal standards.</p>\n<p>Minimum state labor standards affect union and nonunion employees equally, and neither encourage nor discourage the collective bargaining processes that are the subject of the NLRA.  Nor do they have any but the most indirect effect on the right of self-organization established in the Act.  Unlike the NLRA, mandated benefit laws are not laws designed to encourage or discourage employees in the promotion of their interests collectively; rather, they are in part "designed to give specific minimum protections to <em>individual</em> workers and to ensure that <em>each</em> employee covered by the Act would receive" the mandated health insurance coverage.  <em>Barrentine,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#739">450 U. S. 739</a></span> (emphasis in original).  Nor do these laws even inadvertently affect these interests implicated in the NLRA.  Rather, they are minimum standards</p>\n<p>"independent of the collective bargaining process [that] devolve on [employees] as individual workers, not as members of a collective organization."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/728/case.html#745">450 U. S. 745</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It would further few of the purposes of the Act to allow unions and employers to bargain for terms of employment that state law forbids employers to establish unilaterally.</p>\n<p>"Such a rule of law would delegate to unions and unionized employers the power to exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they disfavored."</p>\n<p><em>Allis-Chalmers</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="756">Page 471 U.

It would turn the policy that animated the Wagner Act on its head to understand it to have penalized workers who have chosen to join a union by preventing them from benefiting from state labor regulations imposing minimal standards on nonunion employers.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>Most significantly, there is no suggestion in the legislative history of the Act that Congress intended to disturb the myriad state laws then in existence that set minimum labor standards, but were unrelated in any way to the processes of bargaining or self-organization.  To the contrary, we believe that Congress developed the framework for self-organization and collective bargaining of the NLRA within the larger body of state law promoting public health and safety.  The States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate as "<em>to the protection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.\'"  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/36/case.html">Slaughter-House Cases,</a></span></em> 16 Wall. 36,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/36/case.html#62">83 U.

State laws requiring that employers contribute to unemployment and workmen\'s compensation funds, laws prescribing mandatory state holidays, and those dictating payment to employees for time spent at the polls or on jury duty all have withstood scrutiny.  <em>See, e.g., Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v.

The ERISA saving clause, with its similarly worded protection of "any law of any State which regulates insurance," appears to have been designed to preserve the McCarran-Ferguson Act\'s reservation of the business of insurance to the States.  The saving clause and the McCarran-Ferguson Act serve the same federal policy and utilize similar language to define what is left to the States.  Moreover, \xc2\xa7 514(d) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1144(d), explicitly states in part:  "Nothing in [ERISA] shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States."  Thus, application of the McCarran-Ferguson Act lends further support to our ruling that Congress did not intend mandated benefit laws to be preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The Conference Committee Report merely stated:  "The preemption provisions of title I are not to exempt any person from any State law that regulates insurance."

The preemption clause apparently was broadened out of a fear that "state professional associations" would otherwise hinder the development of such employee benefit programs as "prepaid legal service programs."  <em>See</em> 120 Cong Rec. 29197 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Dent); <em>id.</em> at 29933 (remarks of Sen. Williams); <em>id.</em> at 29949 (remarks of Sen. Javits).  There is no suggestion that the preemption provision was broadened out of any concern about state regulation of insurance contracts, beyond a general concern about "potentially conflicting State laws."  <em>See id.</em> at 29942 (remarks of Sen. Javits).</p>\n<p>The Conference Committee that was convened to work out differences between the Senate and House versions of ERISA broadened the general preemption provision from one that preempted state laws only insofar as they regulated the same areas explicitly regulated by ERISA to one that preempts all state laws unless otherwise saved.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 383 (1974).  The change gave the insurance saving clause a much more significant role, as a provision that saved an entire body of law from the sweeping general preemption clause.  There were no comments on the floor of either Chamber specifically concerning the insurance saving clause, and hardly any concerning the exceptions to the preemption clause in general.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F24" name="T24">n</a> 24, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>The change in the preemption provision was not disclosed until the Report was filed with Congress 10 days before final action was taken on ERISA.
