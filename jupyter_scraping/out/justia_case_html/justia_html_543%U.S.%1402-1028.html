Kirby, Pty Ltd., an Australian manufacturer, hired International Cargo Control (ICC) to arrange for delivery of machinery from Australia to Huntsville, Ala., by \xe2\x80\x9cthrough\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.,</em> end-to-end) transportation.  The bill of lading (essentially, contract) that ICC issued to Kirby (ICC bill) designated Savannah, Ga., as the discharge port and Huntsville as the ultimate destination, and set ICC\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation lower than the cargo\xe2\x80\x99s true value, using the default liability rule in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) ($500 per package) for the sea leg and a higher amount for the land leg.  The bill also contained what is known as a \xe2\x80\x9cHimalaya Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d which extends liability limitations to downstream parties, including, here, \xe2\x80\x9cany servant, agent, or other person (including any independent contractor).\xe2\x80\x9d  Kirby separately insured the cargo for its true value with co-respondent, Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd.  When ICC hired a German shipping company (hereinafter Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd) to transport the containers, Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd issued its own bill of lading to ICC (Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill), designating Savannah as the discharge port and Huntsville as the ultimate destination.  That bill also adopted COGSA\xe2\x80\x99s default rule, extended it to any land damages, and extended it in a Himalaya Clause to \xe2\x80\x9call agents \xe2\x80\xa6 (including inland) carriers \xe2\x80\xa6 and all independent contractors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd hired petitioner Norfolk Southern Railway (Norfolk) to transport the machinery from Savannah to Huntsville.  The train derailed, causing an alleged $1.5 million in damages.  Allianz reimbursed Kirby for the loss and then joined Kirby in suing Norfolk in a Georgia Federal District Court, asserting diversity jurisdiction and alleging tort and contract claims.  Norfolk responded that, among other things, Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s potential recovery could not exceed the liability limitations in the two bills of lading.  The District Court granted Norfolk partial summary judgment, limiting Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability to $500 per container, and certified the decision for interlocutory review.  In reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that Norfolk could not claim protection under the ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s Himalaya Clause because it had not been in privity with ICC when that bill was issued and because linguistic specificity was required to extend the clause\xe2\x80\x99s benefits to an inland carrier.  It also held that Kirby was not bound by the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation because ICC was not acting as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent when it received that bill.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Federal law governs the interpretation of the ICC and Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bills.

This Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to torts or crimes\xe2\x80\x94being conceptual rather than spatial, have always been difficult to draw.\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U. S., at 735.  To ascertain a contract\xe2\x80\x99s maritime nature, this Court looks not to whether a ship or vessel was involved in the dispute, or to the place of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s formation or performance, but to \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and character of the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>North Pacific S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</em> v. <em>Hall Brothers Marine Railway &amp; Shipbuilding Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/249/119/index.html">249 U. S. 119</a>, 125.  Here, the bills are maritime contracts because their primary objective is to accomplish the transportation of goods by sea from Australia to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 eastern coast.  Under a conceptual rather than spatial approach, the fact that the bills call for the journey\xe2\x80\x99s final leg to be by land does not alter the contracts\xe2\x80\x99 essentially maritime nature.  The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection of maritime <em>commerce.</em> \xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Corp.</em> v. <em>Central Gulf Lines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/603/index.html">500 U. S. 603</a>, 608 (emphasis added).  The conceptual approach vindicates that interest by focusing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.  While it may once have seemed natural to think that only contracts embodying commercial obligations between the \xe2\x80\x9ctackles\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, from port to port) have maritime objectives, the shore is now an artificial place to draw a line.  Maritime commerce has evolved along with the nature of transportation and is often inseparable from some land-based obligations.  The international transportation industry has moved into a new era, in which cargo owners can contract for transportation across oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.  The popularity of an efficient choice, to assimilate land legs into international ocean bills of lading, should not render bills for ocean carriage nonmaritime contracts.  Lower court cases that appear to have depended solely on geography in fashioning a rule for identifying maritime contracts are inconsistent with the conceptual approach required by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  Pp.  6\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The case is not inherently local.  A maritime contract\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.  See <em>Kossick, </em>365 U. S.<em>, </em>at 735.  Though some state interests are surely implicated in this case, those interests cannot be accommodated without defeating a federal interest; thus, federal law governs.  See <em>id.,</em> at 739.  The touchstone here is a concern for the uniform meaning of maritime contracts.  Applying state law to cases such as this one would undermine the uniformity of general maritime law.  The same liability limitation in a single bill of lading for international intermodal transportation often applies both to sea and to land, as is true of the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill.  Likewise, a single Himalaya Clause can cover both sea and land carriers downstream, as in the ICC bill.   Confusion and inefficiency will inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a given contract\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  In protecting the uniformity of federal maritime law, this Court also reinforces the liability regime Congress established in COGSA.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Norfolk is entitled to the protection of the liability limitations in both bills of lading.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s broadly written Himalaya Clause limits Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability.  This simple question of contract interpretation turns on whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly applied <em>Robert C. Herd &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Krawill Machinery Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/297/index.html">359 U. S. 297</a>.  Deriving a principle of narrow construction from <em>Herd</em>, the Court of Appeals concluded that the language of the ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s Himalaya Clause is too vague to clearly include Norfolk.  Moreover, it interpreted <em>Herd</em> to require privity between the carrier and the party seeking shelter under a Himalaya Clause.  Nothing in <em>Herd</em> requires such linguistic specificity or privity rules.  It simply says that contracts for carriage of goods by sea must be construed like any other contracts: by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.  The Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is not true to the contract language or the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  The plain language of the Himalaya Clause indicates an intent to extend the liability limitation broadly and corresponds to the fact that various modes of transportation would be involved in performing the contract.  Since Huntsville is some 366 miles inland from the discharge port, the parties must have anticipated using a land carrier\xe2\x80\x99s services for the contract\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  Because it is clear that a railroad was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s broadly written clause, Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability is limited by the clause\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Norfolk also enjoys the benefits of the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation.  The question arising from this bill requires the Court to set an efficient default rule for certain shipping contracts.   To interpret the bill, the Court draws a rule from the common carriage decision of <em>Great Northern R. Co.</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/508/index.html">232 U. S. 508</a>: When an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport goods, the cargo owner\xe2\x80\x99s recovery against the carrier is limited by the liability limitation to which the intermediary and carrier agreed.  The intermediary is not the cargo owner\xe2\x80\x99s agent in every sense, but it can negotiate reliable and enforceable liability limitations with carriers it engages.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that traditional agency law rather than the <em>Great Northern</em> rule should govern here is rejected.  It is of no moment that the traditional indicia of agency did not exist between Kirby and ICC, for the <em>Great Northern</em> principle only requires treating ICC as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent for a <em>single, limited</em> purpose: when ICC contracts with subsequent carriers for liability limitations.  Nor will a decision binding Kirby to the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation be disastrous for the international shipping industry.  First, a limited agency rule tracks industry practices.  Second, if liability limitations negotiated with cargo owners were reliable while those negotiated with intermediaries were not, carriers would likely want to charge the latter higher rates, resulting in discrimination in common carriage.  Finally, this decision produces an equitable result, since Kirby retains the right to sue ICC, the carrier, for any loss exceeding the liability limitation to which they agreed.

A shipment of machinery from Australia was destined for Huntsville, Alabama.  The intercontinental journey was uneventful, and the machinery reached the United States unharmed.  But the train carrying the machinery on its final, inland leg derailed, causing extensive damage.  The machinery\xe2\x80\x99s owner sued the railroad.  The railroad seeks shelter in two liability limitations contained in contracts that upstream carriers negotiated for the machinery\xe2\x80\x99s delivery.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This controversy arises from two bills of lading (essentially, contracts) for the transportation of goods from Australia to Alabama.  A bill of lading records that a carrier has received goods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the terms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract for carriage.  See 2 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law 58\xe2\x80\x9360 (3d ed. 2001) (hereinafter Schoenbaum);<em> </em>Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 49 Stat. 1208, 46 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa71303.  Respondent James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd. (Kirby), an Australian manufacturing company, sold 10 containers of machinery to the General Motors plant located outside Huntsville, Alabama.  Kirby hired International Cargo Control (ICC), an Australian freight forwarding company, to arrange for delivery by \xe2\x80\x9cthrough\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, end-to-end) transportation.  (A freight forwarding company arranges for, coordinates, and facilitates cargo transport, but does not itself transport cargo.)  To formalize their contract for carriage, ICC issued a bill of lading to Kirby (ICC bill).  The bill designates Sydney, Australia, as the port of loading, Savannah, Georgia, as the port of discharge, and Huntsville as the ultimate destination for delivery.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In negotiating the ICC bill, Kirby had the opportunity to declare the full value of the machinery and to have ICC assume liability for that value.  Cf. <em>New York, N.\xc2\xa0H. &amp;\nH. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Nothnagle</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/128/index.html">346 U. S. 128</a>, 135 (1953) (a carrier must provide a shipper with a fair opportunity to declare value). <em> </em>Instead, and as is common in the industry, see Sturley, Carriage of Goods by Sea, 31 J. Mar. L. &amp; Com. 241, 244 (2000), Kirby accepted a contractual liability limitation for ICC below the machinery\xe2\x80\x99s true value, resulting, presumably, in lower shipping rates.  The ICC bill sets various liability limitations for the journey from Sydney to Huntsville.  For the sea leg, the ICC bill invokes the default liability rule set forth in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.  The COGSA \xe2\x80\x9cpackage limitation\xe2\x80\x9d provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNeither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States . . . unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted into the bill of lading.\xe2\x80\x9d 46 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa71304(5).</p>\n<p align="left">\nFor the land leg, in turn, the bill limits the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s liability to a higher amount.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  So that other downstream parties expected to take part in the contract\xe2\x80\x99s execution could benefit from the liability limitations, the bill also contains a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cHimalaya Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThese conditions [for limitations on liability] apply whenever claims relating to the performance of the contract evidenced by this [bill of lading] are made against any servant, agent or other person (including any independent contractor) whose services have been used in order to perform the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, cl.\xc2\xa010.1.</p>\n<p align="left">\nMeanwhile, Kirby separately insured the cargo for its true value with its co-respondent in this case, Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd. (formerly MMI General Insurance, Ltd.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having been hired by Kirby, and because it does not itself actually transport cargo, ICC then hired Hamburg S\xc3\xbcdamerikanische Dampfschiflahrts-Gesellschafft Eggert &amp; Amsinck (Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd), a German ocean shipping company, to transport the containers.  To formalize their contract for carriage, Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd issued its own bill of lading to ICC (Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill).  That bill designates Sydney as the port of loading, Savannah as the port of discharge, and Huntsville as the ultimate destination for delivery.  It adopts COGSA\xe2\x80\x99s default rule in limiting the liability of Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd, the bill\xe2\x80\x99s designated carrier, to $500 per package.  See 46 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa71304(5).  It also contains a clause extending that liability limitation beyond the \xe2\x80\x9ctackles\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, to potential damage on land as well as on sea.  Finally, it too contains a Himalaya Clause extending the benefit of its liability limitation to \xe2\x80\x9call agents . . . (including inland) carriers . . . and all independent contractors whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 63, cl.\xc2\xa05(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acting through a subsidiary, Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd hired Petitioner Norfolk Southern Railroad (Norfolk) to transport the machinery from the Savannah port to Huntsville.  Delivery failed.  The Norfolk train carrying the machinery derailed en route, causing an alleged $1.5 million in damages.  Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s insurance company reimbursed Kirby for the loss.  Kirby and its insurer then sued Norfolk in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, asserting diversity jurisdiction and alleging tort and contract claims.  In its answer, Norfolk argued, among other things, that Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s potential recovery could not exceed the amounts set forth in the liability limitations contained in the bills of lading for the machinery\xe2\x80\x99s carriage. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s motion for partial summary judgment, holding that Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability was limited to $500 per container.  Upon a joint motion from Norfolk and Kirby, the District Court certified its decision for interlocutory review pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71292(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit reversed.  It held that Norfolk could not claim protection under the Himalaya Clause in the first contract, the ICC bill.  It construed the language of the clause to exclude parties, like Norfolk, that had not been in privity with ICC when ICC issued the bill.  300 F.\xc2\xa03d 1300, 1308\xe2\x80\x931309 (2002).  The majority also suggested that \xe2\x80\x9ca special degree of linguistic specificity is required to extend the benefits of a Himalaya clause to an inland carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 1310.  As for the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill, the court held that Kirby could be bound by the bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation \xe2\x80\x9conly if ICC was acting as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent when it received Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd\xe2\x80\x99s bill.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1305.  And, applying basic agency law principles, the Court of Appeals concluded that ICC had not been acting as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent when it received the bill.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Based on its opinion that Norfolk was not entitled to benefit from the liability limitation in either bill of lading, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment for the railroad.  We granted certiorari to decide whether Norfolk could take shelter in the liability limitations of either bill, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1099/index.html">540 U. S. 1099</a> (2004), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The courts below appear to have decided this case on an assumption, shared by the parties, that federal rather than state law governs the interpretation of the two bills of lading.  Respondents now object.  They emphasize that, at bottom, this is a diversity case involving tort and contract claims arising out of a rail accident somewhere between Savannah and Huntsville.  We think, however, borrowing from Justice Harlan, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe situation presented here has a more genuinely salty flavor than that.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kossick</em> v. <em>United Fruit Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/365/731/index.html">365 U. S. 731</a>, 742 (1961).  When a contract is a maritime one, and the dispute is not inherently local, federal law controls the contract interpretation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 735.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our authority to make decisional law for the interpretation of maritime contracts stems from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s grant of admiralty jurisdiction to federal courts.  See Art. III, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01 (providing that the federal judicial power shall extend to \xe2\x80\x9call Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71333(1) (granting federal district courts original jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d); R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 733\xe2\x80\x93738 (5th ed. 2003).  This suit was properly brought in diversity, but it could also be sustained under the admiralty jurisdiction by virtue of the maritime contracts involved.  See <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hawn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/406/index.html">346 U. S. 406</a>, 411 (1953) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ubstantial rights . . . are not to be determined differently whether [a] case is labelled \xe2\x80\x98law side\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98admiralty side\xe2\x80\x99 on a district court\xe2\x80\x99s docket\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, for federal common law to apply in these circumstances, this suit <em>must</em> also be sustainable under the admiralty jurisdiction.  See <em>Stewart Organization, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ricoh Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/22/index.html">487 U. S. 22</a>, 28 (1988).  Because the grant of admiralty jurisdiction and the power to make admiralty law are mutually dependent, the two are often intertwined in our cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the two-step analysis from <em>Kossick</em>, we find that federal law governs this contract dispute.  Our cases do not draw clean lines between maritime and non-maritime contracts.  We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to torts or crimes\xe2\x80\x94being conceptual rather than spatial, have always been difficult to draw.\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U. S., at 735.  To ascertain whether a contract is a maritime one, we cannot look to whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute, as we would in a putative maritime tort case.  Cf. Admiralty Extension Act, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa7740 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States shall extend to and include all cases of damage or injury . . . caused by a vessel on navigable water, notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land\xe2\x80\x9d); R. Force &amp; M. Norris, 1 The Law of Seamen \xc2\xa71:15 (5th ed. 2003).  Nor can we simply look to the place of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s formation or performance.  Instead, the answer \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon . . . the nature and character of the contract,\xe2\x80\x9d and the true criterion is whether it has \xe2\x80\x9creference to maritime service or maritime transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>North Pacific S.

See G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, Law of Admiralty 31 (2d ed. 1975) (\xe2\x80\x9cIdeally, the [admiralty] jurisdiction [over contracts ought] to include those and only those things principally connected<em> </em>with maritime transportation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).  To be sure, the two bills call for some performance on land; the final leg of the machinery\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Huntsville was by rail.  But under a conceptual rather than spatial approach, this fact does not alter the essentially maritime nature of the contracts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Kossick</em>, for example, we held that a shipowner\xe2\x80\x99s promise to assume responsibility for any improper treatment his seaman might receive at a New York hospital was a maritime contract.  The seaman had asked the shipowner to pay for treatment by a private physician, but the shipowner, preferring the cheaper public hospital, offered to cover the costs of any complications that might arise from treatment there.  We characterized his promise as a \xe2\x80\x9cfringe benefit\xe2\x80\x9d to a shipowner\xe2\x80\x99s duty in maritime law to provide \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98maintenance and cure.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U.

It did not matter that the site of the inadequate treatment\xe2\x80\x94which gave rise to the contract dispute\xe2\x80\x94was in a hospital on land.  Likewise, Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s rail journey from Savannah to Huntsville was a \xe2\x80\x9cfringe\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the intercontinental journey promised in the ICC and Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bills.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have reiterated that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cthe protection of maritime <em>commerce</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 608 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Sisson</em> v. <em>Ruby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/358/index.html">497 U.

The conceptual approach vindicates that interest by focusing our inquiry on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.  While it may once have seemed natural to think that only contracts embodying commercial obligations between the \xe2\x80\x9ctackles\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, from port to port) have maritime objectives, the shore is now an artificial place to draw a line.  Maritime commerce has evolved along with the nature of transportation and is often inseparable from some land-based obligations.  The international transportation industry \xe2\x80\x9cclearly has moved into a new era\xe2\x80\x94the age of multimodalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all available modes of transportation by air, water, and land.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Schoenbaum 589 (4th ed. 2004).  The cause is technological change: Because goods can now be packaged in standardized containers, cargo can move easily from one mode of transport to another.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Longshoremen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/490/index.html">447 U. S. 490</a>, 494 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[C]ontainerization may be said to constitute the single most important innovation in ocean transport since the steamship displaced the schooner\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted));<font b="1"> G.

See 1 Schoenbaum 595.  Put simply, it is to Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s advantage to arrange for transport from Sydney to Huntsville in one bill of lading, rather than to negotiate a separate contract\xe2\x80\x94and to find an American railroad itself\xe2\x80\x94for the land leg.  The popularity of that efficient choice, to assimilate land legs into international ocean bills of lading, should not render bills for ocean carriage nonmaritime contracts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some lower federal courts appear to have taken a spatial approach when deciding whether intermodal transportation contracts for intercontinental shipping are maritime in nature.  They have held that admiralty jurisdiction does not extend to contracts which require maritime and nonmaritime transportation, unless the nonmaritime transportation is merely incidental\xe2\x80\x94and that long-distance land travel is not incidental.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Orient Overseas Container Lines</em>, 230 F.\xc2\xa03d 549, 555\xe2\x80\x93556 (CA2 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]ransport by land under a bill of lading is not \xe2\x80\x98incidental\xe2\x80\x99 to transport by sea if the land segment involves great and substantial distances,\xe2\x80\x9d and land transport of over 850 miles across four countries is more than incidental);<em> Sea-Land Serv., Inc.</em> v. <em>Danzig</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d 1373, 1378 (CA Fed. 2000) (holding that intermodal transport contracts were not maritime contracts because they called for \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial transportation between inland locations and ports both in this country and the Middle East\xe2\x80\x9d that was not incidental to the transportation by sea); <em>Kuehne &amp; Nagel (AG &amp; CO)</em> v. <em>Geosource, Inc</em>., 874 F.\xc2\xa02d 283, 290 (CA5 1989) (holding that a through bill of lading calling for land transportation up to 1,000 miles was not a traditional maritime contract because such \xe2\x80\x9cextensive land-based operations cannot be viewed as merely incidental to the maritime operations\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a preliminary matter, it seems to us imprecise to describe the land carriage required by an intermodal transportation contract as \xe2\x80\x9cincidental\xe2\x80\x9d; realistically, each leg of the journey is essential to accomplishing the contract\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  In this case, for example, the bills of lading required delivery to Huntsville; the Savannah port would not do.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, to the extent that these lower court decisions fashion a rule for identifying maritime contracts that depends solely on geography, they are inconsistent with the conceptual approach our precedent requires.  See <em>Kossick</em>, 365 U. S., at 735.  Conceptually, so long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce\xe2\x80\x94and thus it is a maritime contract.  Its character as a maritime contract is not defeated simply because it also provides for some land carriage.  Geography, then, is useful in a conceptual inquiry only in a limited sense: If a bill\xe2\x80\x99s <em>sea</em> components are insubstantial, then the bill is not a maritime contract.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having established that the ICC and Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bills are maritime contracts, then, we must clear a second hurdle before applying federal law in their interpretation.  Is this case inherently local?  For not \xe2\x80\x9cevery term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilburn Boat Co.</em> v. <em>Fireman\xe2\x80\x99s Fund Ins. Co</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/310/index.html">348 U. S. 310</a>, 313 (1955) (applying state law to maritime contract for marine insurance because of state regulatory power over insurance industry).  A maritime contract\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.  See <em>Kossick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 735.  Respondents have not articulated any specific Australian or state interest at stake, though some are surely implicated.  But when state interests cannot be accommodated without defeating a federal interest, as is the case here, then federal substantive law should govern.  See <em>Kossick</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 739 (the process of deciding whether federal law applies \xe2\x80\x9cis surely . . . one of accommodation, entirely familiar in many areas of overlapping state and federal concern, or a process somewhat analogous to the normal conflict of laws situation where two sovereignties assert divergent interests in a transaction\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 Schoenbaum 61 (\xe2\x80\x9cBills of lading issued outside the United States are governed by the general maritime law, considering relevant choice of law rules\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, our touchstone is a concern for the uniform meaning of maritime contracts like the ICC and Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bills.  We have explained that Article III\xe2\x80\x99s grant of admiralty jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country.  It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several States, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the States with each other or with foreign states.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  American Dredging Co.</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/443/index.html">510 U.

The same liability limitation in a single bill of lading for international intermodal transportation often applies both to sea and to land, as is true of the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill.  Such liability clauses are regularly executed around the world.  See 1 Schoenbaum 595; Wood, Multimodal Transportation: An American Perspective on Carrier Liability and Bill of Lading Issues, 46 Am. J. Comp. L. 403, 407 (Supp. 1998).  See also 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71307 (permitting parties to extend the COGSA default liability limit to damage done \xe2\x80\x9cprior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, a single Himalaya Clause can cover both sea and land carriers downstream, as is true of the ICC bill.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>infra.</em>  Confusion and inefficiency will inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a given contract\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  As we said in <em>Kossick</em>, when \xe2\x80\x9ca [maritime] contract \xe2\x80\xa6 may well have been made anywhere in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cshould be judged by one law wherever it was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  365 U. S., at 741.  Here, that one law is federal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In protecting the uniformity of federal maritime law, we also reinforce the liability regime Congress established in COGSA.  By its terms, COGSA governs bills of lading for the carriage of goods \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71301(e).  For that period, COGSA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpackage limitation\xe2\x80\x9d operates as a default rule.  \xc2\xa71304(5).  But COGSA also gives the option of extending its rule by contract.  See \xc2\xa71307 (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation, or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea\xe2\x80\x9d).  As COGSA permits, Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd in its bill of lading chose to extend the default rule to the entire period in which the machinery would be under its responsibility, including the period of the inland transport.  Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd would not enjoy the efficiencies of the default rule if the liability limitation it chose did not apply equally to all legs of the journey for which it undertook responsibility.  And the apparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea, would be defeated.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the merits, we begin with the ICC bill of lading, the first of the contracts at issue.  Kirby and ICC made a contract for the carriage of machinery from Sydney to Huntsville, and agreed to limit the liability of ICC and other parties who would participate in transporting the machinery.  The bill\xe2\x80\x99s Himalaya Clause states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThese conditions [for limitations on liability] apply whenever claims relating to the performance of the contract evidenced by this [bill of lading] are made against <em>any servant, agent</em> <em>or other person (including any independent contractor) whose services have been used in order to perform the contract</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, cl.\xc2\xa010.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe question presented is whether the liability limitation in Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s and ICC\xe2\x80\x99s contract extends to Norfolk, which is ICC\xe2\x80\x99s sub-subcontractor.  The Circuits have split in answering this question.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Akiyama Corp. of America</em> v. <em>M. V. Hanjin Marseilles</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 571, 574 (CA9 1998) (privity of contract is not required in order to benefit from a Himalaya Clause), with <em>Mikinberg</em> v. <em>Baltic S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</em>, 988 F.\xc2\xa02d 327, 332 (CA2 1993) (a contractual relationship is required).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a simple question of contract interpretation.  It turns only on whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly applied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Robert C. Herd &amp; Co</em>. v. <em>Krawill Machinery Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/297/index.html">359 U. S. 297</a> (1959).  We conclude that it did not.  In <em>Herd</em>, the bill of lading between a cargo owner and carrier said that, consistent with COGSA, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Carrier\xe2\x80\x99s liability, if any, shall be determined on the basis of $500 per package.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 302.  The carrier then hired a stevedoring company to load the cargo onto the ship, and the stevedoring company damaged the goods.  The Court held that the stevedoring company was not a beneficiary of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation.  Because it found no evidence in COGSA or its legislative history that Congress meant COGSA\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation to extend automatically to a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s agents, like stevedores, the Court looked to the language of the bill of lading itself.  It reasoned that a clause limiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Carrier\xe2\x80\x99s liability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d did not \xe2\x80\x9cindicate that the contracting parties intended to limit the liability of stevedores or other agents. . . . If such had been a purpose of the contracting parties it must be presumed that they would in some way have expressed it in the contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court added that liability limitations must be \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly construed and limited to intended beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 305.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit, like respondents, made much of the <em>Herd</em> decision.  Deriving a principle of narrow construction from <em>Herd</em>, the Court of Appeals concluded that the language of the ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s Himalaya Clause is too vague to clearly include Norfolk. <em> </em>300 F. 3d, at 1308.  Moreover, the lower court interpreted <em>Herd</em> to require privity between the carrier and the party seeking shelter under a Himalaya Clause.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1308.  But nothing in <em>Herd</em> requires the linguistic specificity or privity rules that the Eleventh Circuit attributes to it.  The decision simply says that contracts for carriage of goods by sea must be construed like any other contracts: by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.  If anything, <em>Herd</em> stands for the proposition that there is no special rule for Himalaya Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling is not true to the contract language or to the intent of the parties.  The plain language of the Himalaya Clause indicates an intent to extend the liability limitation broadly\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> servant, agent or other person (including <em>any</em> independent contractor)\xe2\x80\x9d whose services contribute to performing the contract.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, cl.10.1 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cRead naturally, the word \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 has an expansive meaning, that is, \xe2\x80\x98one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).  There is no reason to contravene the clause\xe2\x80\x99s obvious meaning.  See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle</em>, 8 Wheat. 1, 89\xe2\x80\x9390 (1823) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the words of a law, treaty, or contract, have a plain and obvious meaning, all construction, in hostility with such meaning, is excluded\xe2\x80\x9d).  The expansive contract language corresponds to the fact that various modes of transportation would be involved in performing the contract.  Kirby and ICC contracted for the transportation of machinery from Australia to Huntsville, Alabama, and, as the crow flies, Huntsville is some 366 miles inland from the port of discharge.  See G. Fitzpatrick &amp; M. Modlin, Direct-Line Distances 168 (1986).  Thus, the parties must have anticipated that a land carrier\xe2\x80\x99s services would be necessary for the contract\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  It is clear to us that a railroad like Norfolk was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bill\xe2\x80\x99s broadly written Himalaya Clause.  Accordingly, Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability is limited by the terms of that clause.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question arising from the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill of lading is more difficult.  It requires us to set an efficient default rule for certain shipping contracts, a task that has been a challenge for courts for centuries.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hadley</em> v. <em>Baxendale</em>, 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854).  ICC and Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd agreed that Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd would transport the machinery from Sydney to Huntsville, and agreed to the COGSA \xe2\x80\x9cpackage limitation\xe2\x80\x9d on the liability of Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd, its agents, and its independent contractors.  The second question presented is whether that liability limitation, which ICC negotiated, prevents Kirby from suing Norfolk (Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd\xe2\x80\x99s independent contractor) for more.  As we have explained, the liability limitation in the ICC bill, the first contract, sets liability for a land accident higher than this bill does.  See n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra.</em>  Because Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s liability will be lower if it is protected by the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill too, we must reach this second question in order to give Norfolk the full relief for which it petitioned.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To interpret the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill, we turn to a rule drawn from our precedent about common carriage: When an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport goods, the cargo owner\xe2\x80\x99s recovery against the carrier is limited by the liability limitation to which the intermediary and carrier agreed.  The intermediary is certainly not automatically empowered to be the cargo owner\xe2\x80\x99s agent in every sense.  That would be unsustainable.  But when it comes to liability limitations for negligence resulting in damage, an intermediary can negotiate reliable and enforceable agreements with the carriers it engages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We derive this rule from our decision about common carriage in <em>Great Northern R. Co</em>. v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Connor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/508/index.html">232 U. S. 508</a> (1914).  In <em>Great Northern</em>, an owner hired a transfer company to arrange for the shipment of her goods.  Without the owner\xe2\x80\x99s express authority, the transfer company arranged for rail transport at a tariff rate that limited the railroad\xe2\x80\x99s liability to less than the true value of the goods.  The goods were lost en route, and the owner sued the railroad.  The Court held that the railroad must be able to rely on the liability limitation in its tariff agreement with the transfer company.  The railroad \xe2\x80\x9chad the right to assume that the Transfer Company could agree upon the terms of the shipment\xe2\x80\x9d; it could not be expected to know if the transfer company had any outstanding, conflicting obligation to another party.  <em>Id.,</em> at 514.  The owner\xe2\x80\x99s remedy, if necessary, was against the transfer company.  <em>Id</em>., at 515.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents object to our reading of <em>Great Northern</em>, and argue that this Court should fashion the federal rule of decision from general agency law principles.  Like the Eleventh Circuit, respondents reason that Kirby cannot be bound by the bill of lading that ICC negotiated with Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd unless ICC was then acting as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent.  Other Courts of Appeals have also applied agency law to cases similar to this one.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kukje Hwajae Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>The M/V Hyundai Liberty</em>, 294 F.\xc2\xa03d 1171, 1175\xe2\x80\x931177 (CA9 2002) (an intermediary acted as a cargo owner\xe2\x80\x99s agent when negotiating a bill of lading with a downstream carrier). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think reliance on agency law is misplaced here.  It is undeniable that the traditional indicia of agency, a fiduciary relationship and effective control by the principal, did not exist between Kirby and ICC.  See Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa71 (1957).  But that is of no moment.  The principle derived from <em>Great Northern</em> does not require treating ICC as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent in the classic sense.  It only requires treating ICC as Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s agent for a <em>single, limited</em> purpose: when ICC contracts with subsequent carriers for limitation on liability.  In holding that an intermediary binds a cargo owner to the liability limitations it negotiates with downstream carriers, we do not infringe on traditional agency principles.  We merely ensure the reliability of downstream contracts for liability limitations.  In <em>Great Northern</em>, because the intermediary had been \xe2\x80\x9centrusted with goods to be shipped by railway, and, nothing to the contrary appearing, the carrier had the right to assume that [the intermediary] could agree upon the terms of the shipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  232 U. S., at 514.  Likewise, here we hold that intermediaries, entrusted with goods, are \xe2\x80\x9cagents\xe2\x80\x9d only in their ability to contract for liability limitations with carriers downstream.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also contend that any decision binding Kirby to the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation will be disastrous for the international shipping industry.  Various participants in the industry have weighed in as <em>amici</em> on both sides in this case, and we must make a close call.  It would be idle to pretend that the industry can easily be characterized, or that efficient default rules can easily be discerned.  In the final balance, however, we disagree with respondents for three reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we believe that a limited agency rule tracks industry practices.  In intercontinental ocean shipping, carriers may not know if they are dealing with an intermediary, rather than with a cargo owner.  Even if knowingly dealing with an intermediary, they may not know how many other intermediaries came before, or what obligations may be outstanding among them.  If the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule were the law, carriers would have to seek out more information before contracting, so as to assure themselves that their contractual liability limitations provide true protection.  That task of information gathering might be very costly or even impossible, given that goods often change hands many times in the course of intermodal transportation.  See 1 Schoenbaum 589; Wood, 46 Am. J. Comp. L., at 404.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, if liability limitations negotiated with cargo owners were reliable while limitations negotiated with intermediaries were not, carriers would likely want to charge the latter higher rates.  A rule prompting downstream carriers to distinguish between cargo owners and intermediary shippers might interfere with statutory and decisional law promoting nondiscrimination in common carriage.  Cf.  <em>ICC</em> v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/220/235/index.html">220 U. S. 235</a>, 251\xe2\x80\x93256 (1911) (common carrier cannot \xe2\x80\x9csit in judgment on the title of the prospective shipper\xe2\x80\x9d); Shipping Act, 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71709 (nondiscrimination rules).  It would also, as we have intimated, undermine COGSA\xe2\x80\x99s liability regime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, as in <em>Great Northern</em>, our decision produces an equitable result.  See 232 U. S., at 515.  Kirby retains the option to sue ICC, the carrier, for any loss that exceeds the liability limitation to which they agreed.  And indeed, Kirby <em>has</em> sued ICC in an Australian court for damages arising from the Norfolk derailment.  It seems logical that ICC\xe2\x80\x94the only party that definitely knew about and was party to both of the bills of lading at issue here\xe2\x80\x94should bear responsibility for any gap between the liability limitations in the bills.  Meanwhile, Norfolk enjoys the benefit of the Hamburg S\xc3\xbcd bill\xe2\x80\x99s liability limitation.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that Norfolk is entitled to the protection of the liability limitations in the two bills of lading.  Having undertaken this analysis, we recognize that our decision does no more than provide a legal backdrop against which future bills of lading will be negotiated.  It is not, of course, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s task to structure the international shipping industry.  Future parties remain free to adapt their contracts to the rules set forth here, only now with the benefit of greater predictability concerning the rules for which their contracts might compensate.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The bill provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Freight Forwarder shall in no event be or become liable for any loss of or damage to the goods in an amount exceeding the equivalent of 666.67 SDR per package or unit or 2\nSDR per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher, unless the nature and value of the goods\nshall have been declared by the Consignor.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert.\n57a, cl.\xc2\xa08.3.  An SDR, or Special Drawing Right, is a unit of account created by the International Monetary Fund and calculated daily\non the basis of a basket of currencies.  Liability computed per pack-\nage for the 10 containers, for example, was approximately $17,373 when the bill of lading issued in June 1997, $17,231 when the goods were damaged on October 9, 1997, and $9,763 when the case was argued.  See International Monetary Fund Exchange Rate Archives, http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/rates/param_rms_mth.cfm (as vis-\nited Nov. 5, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file)<font b="1">.  Respondents claim that liability computed by weight is higher.  The machinery\xe2\x80\x99s weight is not in the record.  In any case, because we conclude that Norfolk is also protected by the $500 per package limit in the second bill of lading at issue here, see Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra,</em> and thus cannot be liable for more than $5,000 for the 10 containers, each holding one machine, the precise liability under the ICC bill of lading does not matter.</font></p><font b="1">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Clauses extending liability limitations take their name from an English case involving a steamship called <em>Himalaya</em>.
