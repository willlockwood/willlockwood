The Board\xe2\x80\x99s final decision addressed only the claims on which the Director had instituted review.  On appeal, the Federal Circuit rejected SAS\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa7318(a) required the Board to decide the patentability of every claim challenged in the petition.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0When the Patent Office institutes an inter partes review, it must decide the patentability of all of the claims the petitioner has challenged.  The plain text of \xc2\xa7318(a) resolves this case.  Its directive is both mandatory and comprehensive.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d generally imposes a nondiscretionary duty, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily implies every member of a group.  Thus, \xc2\xa7318(a) means that the Board <i>must </i>address <i>every </i>claim the petitioner has challenged.  The Director\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d power appears nowhere in the statutory text.  And both text and context strongly counsel against inferring such a power.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The statute envisions an inter partes review guided by the initial petition.  See \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  Congress structured the process such that the petitioner, not the Director, defines the proceeding\xe2\x80\x99s contours.  The ex parte reexamination statute shows that Congress knew exactly how to authorize the Director to investigate patentability questions \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n his own initiative, and at any time,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7303(a).  The inter partes review statute indicates that the Director\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d to institute review \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to [the] petition\xe2\x80\x9d is a yes-or-no choice.  \xc2\xa7314(b).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Section 314(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Director find \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d that the petitioner will prevail on \xe2\x80\x9cat least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition\xe2\x80\x9d suggests, if anything, a regime where a reasonable prospect of success on a single claim justifies review of them all.  Again, if Congress had wanted to adopt the Director\xe2\x80\x99s claim-by-claim approach, it knew how to do so.  See \xc2\xa7304.  Nor does it follow that, because \xc2\xa7314(a) invests the Director with discretion on the question <i>whether</i> to institute review, it also invests him with discretion regarding <i>what</i> claims that review will encompass.  The rest of the statute confirms, too, that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s petition, not the Director\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, should guide the life of the litigation.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa7316(a)(8).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Director suggests that a textual discrepancy between \xc2\xa7314(a)\xe2\x80\x94which addresses whether to institute review based on claims found \xe2\x80\x9cin the petition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xc2\xa7318(a)\xe2\x80\x94which addresses the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final resolution of the claims challenged \xe2\x80\x9cby the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94means that the Director enjoys the power to institute a review covering fewer than all of the claims challenged in the petition.  However, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s winnowing mechanism\xe2\x80\x94which allows a patent owner to concede one part of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge and \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ancel any challenged patent claim,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7316(d)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x94fully explains why Congress adopted the slightly different language.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Director\xe2\x80\x99s policy argument\xe2\x80\x94that partial institution is efficient because it permits the Board to focus on the most promising challenges and avoid spending time and resources on others\xe2\x80\x94is properly addressed to Congress, not this Court.  And the Director\xe2\x80\x99s asserted \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d power, which is wholly unmentioned in the statute, is not entitled to deference under <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A.

Recently, the Court upheld the inter partes review statute against a constitutional challenge.  <i>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</i> v. <i>Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Energy Group, LLC</i>, <i>ante,</i> p.\xc2\xa0___.  Now we take up a question concerning the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  When the Patent Office initiates an inter partes review, must it resolve <i>all</i> of the claims in the case, or may it choose to limit its review to only <i>some </i>of them?  The statute, we find, supplies a clear answer: the Patent Office must \xe2\x80\x9cissue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of <i>any </i>patent claim challenged by the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7318(a) (emphasis added).  In this context, as in so many others, \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cevery.\xe2\x80\x9d  The agency cannot curate the claims at issue but must decide them all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress long ago created a patent system granting inventors rights over the manufacture, sale, and use of their inventions.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa08; see\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7154(a)(1).  To win a patent, an applicant must (among other things) file \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d that describe the invention and establish to the satisfaction of the Patent Office the invention\xe2\x80\x99s novelty and nonobviousness.  See<i> </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102, 103, 112(b), 131; <i>Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2016) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sometimes, though, bad patents slip through.  Maybe the invention wasn\xe2\x80\x99t novel, or maybe it was obvious all along, and the patent owner shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy the special privileges it has received.  To remedy these sorts of problems, Congress has long permitted parties to challenge the validity of patent claims in federal court.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7282(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).  More recently, Congress has supplemented litigation with various administrative remedies.  The first of these was ex\xc2\xa0parte reexamination.  Anyone, including the Director of the Patent Office, can seek ex parte reexamination of a patent claim.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7302, 303(a).  Once instituted, though, an ex\xc2\xa0parte reexamination follows essentially the same inquisitorial process between patent owner and examiner as the initial Patent Office examination.  \xc2\xa7305.  Later, Congress supplemented ex\xc2\xa0parte reexamination with inter partes reexamination.  Inter partes reexamination (since repealed) provided a slightly more adversarial process, allowing a third party challenger to submit comments throughout the proceeding.  \xc2\xa7314(b)(2) (2006 ed.) (repealed).  But otherwise it too followed a more or less inquisitorial course led by the Patent Office.  \xc2\xa7314(a).  Apparently unsatisfied with this approach, in 2011 Congress repealed inter partes reexamination and replaced it with inter partes review.  See 35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7311\xe2\x80\x93319 (2012 ed.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The new inter partes review regime looks a good deal more like civil litigation.  At its outset, a party must file \xe2\x80\x9ca petition to institute an inter partes review of [a] patent.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7311(a).  The petition \xe2\x80\x9cmay request to cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of [the] patent\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that the claims are obvious or not novel.  \xc2\xa7311(b); see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102 and 103.  In doing so, the petition must identify \xe2\x80\x9ceach claim challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d the grounds for the challenge, and the evidence supporting the challenge.  \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  The patent owner, in turn, may respond with \xe2\x80\x9ca preliminary response to the petition\xe2\x80\x9d explaining \xe2\x80\x9cwhy no inter partes review should be instituted.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7313.  With the parties\xe2\x80\x99 submissions before him, the Director then decides \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to institute an inter partes review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pursuant to [the] petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(b).  (In practice, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Trial and Appeal Board exercises this authority on behalf of the Director, see 37 CFR \xc2\xa742.4(a) (2017).)  Before instituting review, the Director must determine, based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 papers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7314(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Once the Director institutes an inter partes review, the matter proceeds before the Board with many of the usual trappings of litigation.  The parties conduct discovery and join issue in briefing and at an oral hearing.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7316(a)(5), (6), (8), (10), (13).  During the course of the case, the patent owner may seek to amend its patent or to cancel one or more of its claims.  \xc2\xa7316(d).  The parties may also settle their differences and seek to end the review.  \xc2\xa7317.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed,\xe2\x80\x9d at the end of the litigation the Board \xe2\x80\x9cshall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7318(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our case arose when SAS sought an inter partes review of ComplementSoft\xe2\x80\x99s software patent.  In its petition, SAS alleged that all 16 of the patent\xe2\x80\x99s claims were unpatent- able for various reasons.  The Director (in truth the Board acting on the Director\xe2\x80\x99s behalf) concluded that SAS was likely to succeed with respect to at least one of the claims and that an inter partes review was therefore warranted.  But instead of instituting review on all of the claims challenged in the petition, the Director instituted review on only some (claims 1 and 3\xe2\x80\x9310) and denied review on the rest.  The Director did all this on the strength of a Patent Office regulation that purported to recognize a power of \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution,\xe2\x80\x9d claiming that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen instituting <i>inter partes </i>review, the [Director] may authorize the review to proceed on all or some of the challenged claims and on all or some or the grounds of unpatentability asserted for each claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  37 CFR \xc2\xa742.108(a).  At the end of litigation, the Board issued a final written decision finding claims 1, 3, and 5\xe2\x80\x9310 to be unpatentable while upholding claim 4.  But the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision did not address the remaining claims on which the Director had refused review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That last fact led SAS to seek review in the Federal Circuit.  There SAS argued that\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7318(a) required the Board to decide the patentability of <i>every </i>claim SAS challenged in its petition, not just some.  For its part, the Federal Circuit rejected SAS\xe2\x80\x99s argument over a vigorous dissent by Judge Newman.  <i>SAS Institute, Inc. </i>v. <i>ComplementSoft, LLC</i>,<i> </i>825 F.\xc2\xa03d 1341 (2016).  We granted certiorari to decide the question ourselves.  581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We find that the plain text of \xc2\xa7318(a) supplies a ready answer.  It directs that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed under this chapter, the [Board] <i>shall issue</i> a final written decision with respect to the patentability of <i>any patent claim challenged by the petitioner </i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7318(a) (emphasis added).  This directive is both mandatory and comprehensive.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d generally imposes a nondiscretionary duty.  See <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26, 35 (1998)\n.  And the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d naturally carries \xe2\x80\x9can expansive meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 5 (1997).  When used (as here) with a \xe2\x80\x9csingular noun in affirmative contexts,\xe2\x80\x9d the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9crefer[s] to a member of a particular group or class without distinction or limitation\xe2\x80\x9d and in this way \xe2\x80\x9cimpl[ies] <i>every </i>member of the class or group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., Mar. 2016), www.oed.com/view/Entry/8973 (OED) (emphasis added) (all Internet materials as last visited Apr. 20, 2018).  So when \xc2\xa7318(a) says the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final written decision \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d resolve the patentability of \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged by the petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d it means the Board <i>must</i> address <i>every </i>claim the petitioner has challenged.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That would seem to make this an easy case.  Where a statute\xe2\x80\x99s language carries a plain meaning, the duty of an administrative agency is to follow its commands as written, not to supplant those commands with others it may prefer.  <i>Social Security Bd.</i> v. <i>Nierotko</i>,\n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 358, 369 (1946)\n.  Because SAS challenged all 16 claims of ComplementSoft\xe2\x80\x99s patent, the Board in its final written decision had to address the patentability of all 16 claims.  Much as in the civil litigation system it mimics, in an inter partes review the petitioner is master of its complaint and normally entitled to judgment on all of the claims it raises, not just those the decisionmaker might wish to address.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Director replies that things are not quite as simple as they seem.  Maybe the Board has to decide every claim challenged by the petitioner in an inter partes review.  But, he says, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean every challenged claim gains admission to the review process.  In the Director\xe2\x80\x99s view, he retains discretion to decide which claims make it into an inter partes review and which don\xe2\x80\x99t.  The trouble is, nothing in the statute says anything like that.  The Director\xe2\x80\x99s claimed \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d power appears nowhere in the text of \xc2\xa7318, or anywhere else in the statute for that matter.  And what can be found in the statutory text and context strongly counsels against the Director\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Start where the statute does.  In its very first provision, the statute says that a party may seek inter partes review by filing \xe2\x80\x9ca petition to institute an inter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7311(a).  This language doesn\xe2\x80\x99t authorize the Director to start proceedings on his own initiative.  Nor does it contemplate a petition that asks the Director to initiate whatever kind of inter partes review he might choose.  Instead, the statute envisions that a petitioner will seek an inter partes review of a particular kind\xe2\x80\x94one guided by a petition describing \xe2\x80\x9ceach claim challenged\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7312(a)(3).  From the outset, we see that Congress chose to structure a process in which it\xe2\x80\x99s the petitioner, not the Director, who gets to define the contours of the proceeding.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa0j]ust as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of words is presumed to be deliberate\xe2\x80\x9d and deserving of judicial respect, \xe2\x80\x9cso too are its structural choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center</i> v. <i>Nassar</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338, 353 (2013)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It\xe2\x80\x99s telling, too, to compare this structure with what came before.  In the ex parte reexamination statute, Congress embraced an inquisitorial approach, authorizing the Director to investigate a question of patentability \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n his own initiative, and at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7303(a).  If Congress had wanted to give the Director similar authority over the institution of inter partes review, it knew exactly how to do so\xe2\x80\x94it could have simply borrowed from the statute next door.  But rather than create (another) agency-led, inquisitorial process for reconsidering patents, Congress opted for a party-directed, adversarial process.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s choice to depart from the model of a closely related statute is a choice neither we nor the agency may disregard.  See <i>Nassar</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More confirmation comes as we move to the point of institution.  Here the statute says the Director must decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to institute an inter partes review .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. pursuant to a petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(b).  The Director, we see, is given only the choice \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d to institute an inter partes review.  That language indicates a binary choice\xe2\x80\x94either institute review or don\xe2\x80\x99t.  And by using the term \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress told the Director what he must say yes or no to: an inter partes review that proceeds \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin conformance to\xe2\x80\x9d the petition.  OED, www.oed.com/view/Entry/155073.  Nothing suggests the Director enjoys a license to depart from the petition and institute a <i>different</i> inter partes review of his own design.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To this the Director replies by pointing to another part of \xc2\xa7314.  Section 314(a) provides that the Director may not authorize an inter partes review unless he determines \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d the petitioner will prevail on \xe2\x80\x9cat least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Director argues that this language requires him to \xe2\x80\x9cevaluate claims individually\xe2\x80\x9d and so must allow him to institute review on a claim-by-claim basis as well.  Brief for Federal Respondent 28.  But this language, if anything, suggests just the opposite.  Section 314(a) does not require the Director to evaluate every claim individually.  Instead, it simply requires him to decide whether the petitioner is likely to succeed on \xe2\x80\x9cat least 1\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  Once that single claim threshold is satisfied, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether the petitioner is likely to prevail on any <i>additional</i> claims; the Director need not even consider any other claim before instituting review.  Rather than contemplate claim-by-claim institution, then, the language anticipates a regime where a reasonable prospect of success on a single claim justifies review of all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here again we know that if Congress wanted to adopt the Director\xe2\x80\x99s approach it knew exactly how to do so.  The ex parte reexamination statute allows the Director to assess whether a request raises \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim\xe2\x80\x9d and (if so) to institute reexamination limited to \xe2\x80\x9cresolution of <i>the question</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7304 (emphasis added).  In other words, that statute allows the Director to institute proceedings on a claim-by-claim and ground-by-ground basis.  But Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose to pursue that known and readily available approach here.  And its choice to try something new must be given effect rather than disregarded in favor of the comfort of what came before.  See <i>Nassar</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 353\xe2\x80\x93354.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Faced with this difficulty, the Director tries another tack.  He points to the fact that \xc2\xa7314(a) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t <i>require</i> him to institute an inter partes review even after he finds the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d threshold met with respect to one claim.  Whether to institute proceedings upon such a finding, he says, remains a matter left to his discretion.  See <i>Cuozzo</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  But while \xc2\xa7314(a) invests the Director with discretion on the question <i>whether</i> to institute review, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow that the statute affords him discretion regarding <i>what</i> claims that review will encompass.  The text says only that the Director can decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d to institute the requested review\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether <i>and to what extent</i>\xe2\x80\x9d review should proceed.  \xc2\xa7314(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rest of the statute confirms, too, that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s petition, not the Director\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, is supposed to guide the life of the litigation.  For example, \xc2\xa7316(a)(8) tells the Director to adopt regulations ensuring that, \xe2\x80\x9cafter an inter partes review has been instituted,\xe2\x80\x9d the patent owner will file \xe2\x80\x9ca response to the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Surely it would have made little sense for Congress to insist on a response <i>to the petition</i> if, in truth, the Director enjoyed the discretion to limit the claims under review.  What\xe2\x80\x99s the point, after all, of answering claims that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the proceeding?  If Congress had meant to afford the Director the power he asserts, we would have expected it to instruct him to adopt regulations requiring the patent owner to file a response <i>to the Director\xe2\x80\x99s institution notice</i> or <i>to the claims on which the Director instituted review</i>.  Yet we have nothing like that here.  And then and again there is \xc2\xa7318(a).  At the end of the proceeding, \xc2\xa7318(a) categorically commands the Board to address in its final written decision \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged by the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  In all these ways, the statute tells us that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, not the Director\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, define the scope of the litigation all the way from institution through to conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Director says we can find at least some hint of the discretion he seeks by comparing \xc2\xa7314(a) and \xc2\xa7318(a).  He notes that, when addressing whether to institute review at the beginning of the litigation, \xc2\xa7314(a) says he must focus on the claims found \xe2\x80\x9cin the petition\xe2\x80\x9d; but when addressing what claims the Board must address at the end of the litigation, \xc2\xa7318(a) says it must resolve the claims challenged \xe2\x80\x9cby the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the Director, this (slight) linguistic discrepancy means the claims the Board must address in its final decision are not necessarily the same as those identified in the petition.  And the only possible explanation for this arrangement, the Director submits, is that he must enjoy the (admittedly implicit) power to institute an inter partes review that covers fewer than all of the claims challenged in the petition.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We just don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.  Whatever differences they might display, \xc2\xa7314(a) and \xc2\xa7318(a) both focus on the <i>petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s</i> contentions and, given that, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see how they might be read to give the <i>Director</i> power to decide what claims are at issue.  Particularly when there\xe2\x80\x99s a much simpler and sounder explanation for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s wording.  As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, a patent owner may move to \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ancel any challenged patent claim\xe2\x80\x9d during the course of an inter partes review, effectively conceding one part of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge.  \xc2\xa7316(d)(1)(A).  Naturally, then, the claims challenged \xe2\x80\x9cin the petition\xe2\x80\x9d will not always survive to the end of the case; some may drop out thanks to the patent owner\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  And in that light it is plain enough why Congress provided that only claims still challenged \xe2\x80\x9cby the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d at the litigation\xe2\x80\x99s end must be addressed in the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final written decision.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s own winnowing mechanism fully explains why Congress adopted slightly different language in \xc2\xa7314(a) and \xc2\xa7318(a).  We need not and will not invent an atextual explanation for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s drafting choices when the statute\xe2\x80\x99s own terms supply an answer.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235, 240\n\xe2\x80\x93241 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent, there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moving past the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and context, the Director attempts a policy argument.  He tells us that partial institution is efficient because it permits the Board to focus on the most promising challenges and avoid spending time and resources on others.  Brief for Federal Respondent 35\xe2\x80\x9336; see also <i>post, </i>at 1 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <i>post, </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  SAS responds that all patent challenges usually end up being litigated <i>somewhere</i>, and that partial institution creates inefficiency by requiring the parties to litigate in two places instead of one\xe2\x80\x94the Board for claims the Director chooses to entertain and a federal court for claims he refuses.  Indeed, SAS notes, the government itself once took the same view, arguing that partial institution \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undermine[s] the Congressional efficiency goal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for this very reason.  Brief for Petitioner 30.  Each side offers plausible reasons why its approach might make for the more efficient policy.  But who should win that debate isn\xe2\x80\x99t our call to make.  Policy arguments are properly addressed to Congress, not this Court.  It is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s job to enact policy and it is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s job to follow the policy Congress has prescribed.  And whatever its virtues or vices, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed policy here is clear: the petitioner in an inter partes review is entitled to a decision on all the claims it has challenged.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That leaves the Director to suggest that, however this Court might read the statute, he should win anyway because of <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837 (1984)\n.  Even though the statute says nothing about his asserted \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d power, the Director says the statute is at least ambiguous on the propriety of the practice and so we should leave the matter to his judgment.  For its part, SAS replies that we might use this case as an opportunity to abandon <i>Chevron</i> and embrace the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impressive body\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of pre-<i>Chevron</i> law recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the meaning of a statutory term\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is properly a matter for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial [rather than] administrative judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 41 (quoting <i>Pittston Stevedoring Corp.</i> v. <i>Dellaventura</i>, 544 F.\xc2\xa02d 35, 49 (CA2 1976) (Friendly, J.)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But whether <i>Chevron </i>should remain is a question we may leave for another day.  Even under <i>Chevron</i>, we owe an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the law no deference unless, after \xe2\x80\x9cemploying traditional tools of statutory construction,\xe2\x80\x9d we find ourselves unable to discern Congress\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 843, n.\xc2\xa09.  And after applying traditional tools of interpretation here, we are left with no uncertainty that could warrant deference.  The statutory provisions before us deliver unmistakable commands.  The statute hinges inter partes review on the filing of a petition challenging specific patent claims; it makes the petition the centerpiece of the proceeding both before and after institution; and it requires the Board\xe2\x80\x99s final written decision to address every claim the petitioner presents for review.  There is no room in this scheme for a wholly unmentioned \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d power that lets the Director select only some challenged claims for decision.  The Director may (today) think his approach makes for better policy, but policy considerations cannot create an ambiguity when the words on the page are clear.  See <i>SEC</i> v. <i>Sloan</i>,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, 116\n\xe2\x80\x93117 (1978).  Neither may we defer to an agency official\xe2\x80\x99s preferences because we imagine some \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical reasonable legislator\xe2\x80\x9d would have favored that approach.  <i>Post, </i>at<i> </i>9 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Our duty is to give effect to the text that 535 <i>actual</i> legislators (plus one President) enacted into law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At this point, only one final question remains to resolve.  Even if the statute forbids his partial institution practice, the Director suggests we lack the power to say so.  By way of support, he points to \xc2\xa7314(d) and our decision in <i>Cuozzo</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  Section 314(d) says that the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination by the Director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Cuozzo</i>,<i> </i>we held that this provision prevented courts from entertaining an argument that the Director erred in instituting an inter partes review of certain patent claims.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x9312).  The Director reads these authorities as foreclosing judicial review of any legal question bearing on the institution of inter partes review\xe2\x80\x94including whether the statute permits his \xe2\x80\x9cpartial institution\xe2\x80\x9d practice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this reading overreads both the statute and our precedent.  As <i>Cuozzo</i> recognized, we begin with \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98strong presumption\xe2\x80\x99 in favor of judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9).  To overcome that presumption, <i>Cuozzo</i> explained, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents require \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing indications\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress meant to foreclose review.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the strength of this presumption and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, <i>Cuozzo </i>concluded that \xc2\xa7314(d) precludes judicial review only of the Director\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinitial determination\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7314(a) that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x99 that the claims are unpatentable on the grounds asserted\xe2\x80\x9d and review is therefore justified.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 9); see <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (review unavailable \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a patent holder merely challenges the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98determin[ation] that the information presented in the petition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shows that there is a reasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x99 of success \xe2\x80\x98with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> ibid.</i> (claim that a \xe2\x80\x9cpetition was not pleaded \xe2\x80\x98with particularity\xe2\x80\x99 under \xc2\xa7312 is little more than a challenge to the Patent Office\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, under \xc2\xa7314(a), that the \xe2\x80\x98information presented in the petition\xe2\x80\x99 warranted review\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, <i>Cuozzo</i> proceeded to emphasize that \xc2\xa7314(d) does not \xe2\x80\x9cenable the agency to act outside its statutory limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).

SAS does not seek to challenge the Director\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that it showed a \xe2\x80\x9creason- able likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of success sufficient to warrant \xe2\x80\x9cinstitut[ing] an inter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7314(a), (d).  No doubt SAS remains very pleased with the Director\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on that score.  Instead, SAS contends that the Director exceeded his statutory authority by limiting the review to fewer than all of the claims SAS challenged.  And nothing in \xc2\xa7314(d) or <i>Cuozzo</i> withdraws our power to ensure that an inter partes review proceeds in accordance with the law\xe2\x80\x99s demands.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because everything in the statute before us confirms that SAS is entitled to a final written decision addressing all of the claims it has challenged and nothing suggests we lack the power to say so, the judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">So ordered.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg suggests the Director might yet avoid this command by refusing to review a petition he thinks too broad while signaling his willingness to entertain one more tailored to his sympathies.  <i>Post, </i>at 1 (dissenting opinion).

An example will help the reader keep that framework in mind.  Suppose the Patent Office issues a patent containing, say, 16 different claims.  A challenger, believing the patent is invalid, seeks to invoke the inter partes review procedure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory chapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cInter partes review\xe2\x80\x9d explains just how this is to be done.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7311\xe2\x80\x93319.  First, the challenger files a petition requesting \xe2\x80\x9ccancel[lation]\xe2\x80\x9d of one or more of the patent claims as \xe2\x80\x9cunpatentable\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cprior art\xe2\x80\x9d shows, for example, that they are not \xe2\x80\x9cnovel.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7311(b); see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102, 103.  That petition must detail the grounds for the challenge and the supporting evidence, along with providing certain technical information.  \xc2\xa7312.  Second, the patent owner may file a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary response\xe2\x80\x9d to the petition.  \xc2\xa7313.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the Director of the Patent Office will decide whether to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitute\xe2\x80\x9d inter partes review.  \xc2\xa7314.  The statute specifies that the Director \xe2\x80\x9cmay not authorize an inter partes review to be instituted unless the Director determines .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(a).  Thus, in my example, if the Director determines that none of the 16 challenges in the petition has likely merit, he cannot institute an inter partes review.  Even if there is one potentially meritorious challenge, we have said that the statute contains \xe2\x80\x9cno mandate to institute review,\xe2\x80\x9d so the Director still has discretion to deny a petition.  <i>Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</i> v. <i>Lee</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  We have also held that the Director\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to institute review is normally not reviewable.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Director, by regulation, has delegated the power to institute review to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.  37 CFR \xc2\xa742.4(a) (2017).  And the Director has further provided by regulation that where a petition challenges several patent claims (say, all 16 claims in my example), \xe2\x80\x9cthe Board may authorize the review to proceed on all <i>or some</i> of the challenged claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa742.108(a) (emphasis added).  Thus, where some, but not all, of the challenges have likely merit (say, 1 of the 16 has likely merit and the others are close to frivolous), the Board is free to conduct inter partes review only as to the challenge with likely merit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Fourth, the statute next describes the relation of a petition for review and an instituted review to other proceedings involving the challenged patent.  \xc2\xa7315.  Fifth, the statute describes what happens once the Board begins its inter partes review, including how the Board is to take evidence and make its decisions, \xc2\xa7316, and the nature and effect of settlements, \xc2\xa7317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sixth, the statute sets forth the section primarily at issue here, which describes what happens at the end of the process.  It says:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cFinal Written Decision. If an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed under this chapter, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of <i>any patent claim challenged by the petitioner</i> and any new claim added under section 316(d).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7318(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the chapter says that a \xe2\x80\x9cparty dissatisfied with the final written decision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may appeal the decision\xe2\x80\x9d to the U.\xc2\xa0S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  \xc2\xa7319; see \xc2\xa7141(c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, going through this process, if a petitioner files a petition challenging 16 claims and the Board finds that the challenges to 15 of the claims are frivolous, the Board may then, as it interprets the statute, begin and proceed through the inter partes review process as to the remaining claim, number 16, but not in respect to the other 15 claims.  Eventually the Board will produce a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written decision\xe2\x80\x9d as to the patentability of claim number 16, which decision the challenger (or the patentee) can appeal to the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Now let us return to the question at hand, the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7318(a).  Do those words unambiguously refer, as the majority believes, to \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d <i>in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s original petition</i>?  The words \xe2\x80\x9cin the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s original petition\xe2\x80\x9d do not appear in the statute.  And the words that do appear, \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged by the petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d could be modified by using different words that similarly do not appear, for example, the words \xe2\x80\x9cin the inter partes review proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  But without added words, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d does not tell us whether the relevant challenge is one made in the initial petition or only one made in the inter partes review proceeding itself.  And, linguistically speaking, there is as much reason to fill that gap with reference to the claims still being challenged in the proceeding itself as there is to fill it with reference to claims that were initially challenged in the petition but which the Board weeded out before the inter partes review proceeding began.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Which reading we give the statute makes a difference.  The first reading, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading, means that in my example, the Board must consider and write a final, and <i>appealable</i>, see \xc2\xa7319, decision in respect to the challenges to all 16 claims, including the 15 frivolous challenges.  The second reading requires the Board to write a final, appealable decision only in respect to the challenge to the claim (number 16 in my example) that survived the Board\xe2\x80\x99s initial screening, namely, in my example, the one challenge in respect to which the Board found a \xe2\x80\x9creason-able likelihood that the petitioner would prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7314(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I cannot find much in the statutory context to support the majority\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the statutory words \xe2\x80\x9cclaim challenged by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d refer unambiguously to claims challenged initially in the petition.  After all, the majority agrees that they do not refer to claims that initially were challenged in the petition but were later settled or withdrawn.  <i>Ante</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310;<i> </i>see \xc2\xa7316(d)(1)(A) (allowing the patent owner to cancel a challenged patent claim during inter partes review); \xc2\xa7317 (addressing settlement).  The majority says that weeded-out challenges, unlike settled matters or canceled claims, involve claims that are still being \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged \xe2\x80\x98by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99 at the litigation\xe2\x80\x99s end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But weeded-out challenges are the same as settled matters and canceled claims in this respect.  The petitioner cannot continue to challenge a claim once that challenge is weeded out by the Board at the institution phase.  He cannot pursue it before the Board in the inter partes review, and normally he cannot pursue it in a court of appeals.  See <i>Cuozzo</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312).  The petitioner might bring a totally separate case in court in which he challenges the claim, but that is a different matter that is not the subject of this statutory chapter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the chapter\xe2\x80\x99s structure help fill the statutory gap.  I concede that if we examine the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written decision\xe2\x80\x9d section, \xc2\xa7318(a), just after reading the three initial sections of the statute, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7311, 312, and 313, we may be tempted to believe that the words \xe2\x80\x9cany patent claim challenged\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7318(a) must refer to the claims challenged in the petition, just as the words \xe2\x80\x9ceach claim challenged\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7312(a)(3) unmistakably do.  But once we look at the whole statute, this temptation disappears.  The first section, \xc2\xa7311, describing the inter partes review process, does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  The next section, \xc2\xa7312, describes the requirements for the initial petition, which is filed <i>before</i> any inter partes proceeding has been insti-tuted.  It is about the petition, so it is not surprising that it refers to the claims challenged in the petition.  The next section, \xc2\xa7313, concerns the preliminary response, which is similarly filed before the inter partes review proceeding has been instituted and is thus similarly focused on the petition, although it does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The very next section, however, \xc2\xa7314, along with part of \xc2\xa7315, describes preliminary screening and the <i>institution</i> of the inter partes review proceeding.  The remainder of \xc2\xa7315, and the following sections, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7316 and 317, then describe how that proceeding, once instituted, will be conducted (and provide for settlements).  Only then does \xc2\xa7318 appear.  That statutory provision tells the Board that, at the conclusion of the inter partes review proceeding, it must \xe2\x80\x9cissue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7318(a).  And in this context, a context about the inter partes review proceeding itself, it is more than reasonable to think that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpatent claim challenged by the petitioner\xe2\x80\x9d refers to challenges made in the proceeding, not challenges made in the petition but never made a part of the proceeding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I am not helped by examining, as the majority examines, what Congress might have done had it used other language.  <i>Ante, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  The majority points out that had Congress meant anything other than \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged in the petition,\xe2\x80\x9d it might have said so more clearly.  <i>Ibid.</i>  But similarly, if Congress had meant \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged in the petition,\xe2\x80\x9d it might have used the words \xe2\x80\x9cin the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  After all, it used those very words only four sections earlier.  See \xc2\xa7314(a) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cclaims challenged in the petition\xe2\x80\x9d).  This argument, like many such arguments, is a wash.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither am I helped by analogizing the inter partes review proceeding to civil litigation.  Cf. <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 5.  That is because, as this Court said in <i>Cuozzo</i>, inter partes review is a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  It has some adversarial characteristics, but \xe2\x80\x9cin other significant respects, inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.,</i> at<i> ___ </i>(slip op., at 15)<i>.</i>  Its purposes are not limited to \xe2\x80\x9chelping resolve concrete patent-related disputes among parties,\xe2\x80\x9d but extend to \xe2\x80\x9creexamin[ing] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an earlier administrative grant of a patent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] the public\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are kept within their legitimate scope.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Precision Instrument Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.</i>,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806, 816 (1945)\n; ellipsis in original); see also <i>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</i> v. <i>Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Energy Group, LLC</i>, ___ U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2018) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, I would turn to the likely purposes of the statutory provision.  As the majority points out, \xc2\xa7314(a) makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cDirector\xe2\x80\x9d (now his delegate, the Board) is to determine whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of success as to at least one of the claims the petition challenges.  If not, he cannot initiate an inter partes review proceeding.  If so, \xc2\xa7314(a) \xe2\x80\x9cinvests the Director with discretion on the question whether to institute review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 8 (emphasis deleted); <i>Cuozzo</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).  As I have said, Patent Office regulations allow the Board to proceed with inter partes review of some of the claims a petitioner challenges (say, only those where there is a reasonable likelihood of success), but not of others.  37 CFR \xc2\xa742.108(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority points out that it does not follow from \xc2\xa7314(a) that the statute affords the Director discretion regarding <i>what claims that review will encompass</i>.  The text says only that the Director can decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d to institute the requested review, not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether and to what extent\xe2\x80\x9d review should proceed.  <i>Ante, </i>at 8 (emphasis de-leted).  That is certainly so.  But I think that when we, as judges, face a difficult text, it is often helpful to ask not just \xe2\x80\x9cwhether\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cwhy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Why, asks the Patent Office, would Congress have intended to require the Board to proceed with an inter partes review, take evidence, and hear argument in respect to challenges to claims that the Board had previously determined had no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood\xe2\x80\x9d of success?  The statute would seem to give the Director discretion to achieve the opposite, namely, to avoid wasting the Board\xe2\x80\x99s time and effort reviewing challenges that it has already decided have no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable likelihood of success.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my example, why make the Board do further work on the challenges to claims 1 through 15, which the Board has already decided are near frivolous?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More than that, to read \xc2\xa7318(a) as requiring a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written decision\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to those 15 perhaps frivolous challenges would seem to lead to judicial review of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision about those frivolous challenges.  After all, \xc2\xa7319 of the statute says that a \xe2\x80\x9cparty dissatisfied with the final written decision of the [Board] under section 318(a),\xe2\x80\x9d the provision before us, \xe2\x80\x9cmay appeal the decision\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Circuit.  And the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is anomalous in that it is difficult to imagine why Congress, with one hand, would make the agency\xe2\x80\x99s weeding-out decision nonreviewable, see <i>Cuozzo</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9312), yet at the same time would make the decision reviewable via the requirement that the Board issue a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal written\xe2\x80\x9d appealable \xe2\x80\x9cdecision\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to that weeded-out challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I end up where I began.  Section 318(a) contains a gap just after the words \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged by the petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Considerations of context, structure, and purpose do not close the gap.  And under <i>Chevron</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a statute leaves a \xe2\x80\x98gap\xe2\x80\x99 or is \xe2\x80\x98ambigu[ous],\xe2\x80\x99 we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text, nature, and purpose of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cuozzo</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mead Corp.</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, 229 (2001)\n; alteration in original).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In referring to <i>Chevron</i>, I do not mean that courts are to treat that case like a rigid, black-letter rule of law, instructing them always to allow agencies leeway to fill every gap in every statutory provision.  See <i>Mead Corp.</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 229\xe2\x80\x93231.  Rather, I understand <i>Chevron</i> as a rule of thumb, guiding courts in an effort to respect that leeway which Congress intended the agencies to have.  I recognize that Congress does not always consider such matters, but if not, courts can often implement a more general, virtually omnipresent congressional purpose\xe2\x80\x94namely, the creation of a well-functioning statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x94by using a canon-like, judicially created construct, the hypothetical reasonable legislator, and asking what such legislators would likely have intended had Congress considered the question of delegating gap-filling authority to the agency.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To answer this question, we have previously held that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatute\xe2\x80\x99s complexity, the vast number of claims that it engenders, and the consequent need for agency expertise and administrative experience\xe2\x80\x9d normally \xe2\x80\x9clead us to read [a] statute as delegating to the Agency considerable authority to fill in, through interpretation, matters of detail related to its administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Walton</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 212, 225 (2002)\n.  These considerations all favor such a reading here.  Indeed, the question before us is one of agency administration in respect to detailed matters that an agency working with the statute is particularly likely to understand.  In addition, the agency filled the gap here through the exercise of rulemaking authority explicitly given it by Congress to issue regulations \xe2\x80\x9csetting forth the standards for the showing of sufficient grounds to institute a review\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing and governing inter partes review.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7316(a)(2), (4);<i> Cuozzo</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313); cf. <i>Mead Corp.</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 227.  Thus, there is a gap, the agency possesses gap-filling authority, and it filled the gap with a regulation that, for reasons I have stated, is a reasonable exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I consequently would affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit.
