JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The defendants in error brought suit in the district court of Lincoln County, Oklahoma, against the plaintiff in error, for damages, alleging that they were the owners of a certain racehorse which had been shipped by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 233 U.

There was a verdict and judgment for the defendants in error, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma (36 Okl. 433).</p>\n<p>It appears that the horse, for the injury to which this suit was brought, was a part of the shipment under which the horse in the previous case of <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

S. 173</a></span>, was carried as therein stated, and that the facts relating to the shipment and cause of injury set forth in the present case are the same as those in the <em>Robinson</em> case.  The Supreme Court of Oklahoma, after noticing the fact that, except as to the value of the animals, the extent of their injuries and the resulting damages, the two cases were identical in every material feature, followed the <em>Robinson</em> case.</p>\n<p>The present case therefore is controlled by the decision in the <em>Robinson</em> case, and, from what we have there said, it follows that the judgment here under review must be reversed.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
