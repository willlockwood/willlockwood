However, the court went on to discuss the Commission\'s findings on the merits. It concluded that the Commission had not justified its conclusions that (a) the $22 charge was not shown to approximate transit costs and (b) the line haul rate was sufficient to cover the costs involved. The court then found that the Commission\'s conclusion that the new charge would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="934">Page 400 U.S. 932 , 934</a></p><p> have diverted traffic to motor carriers was based on substantial evidence. On the basis of the last finding, the court upheld the ICC\'s action and entered an order denying relief to appellants. </p><p> It has been settled law since the first Chenery case that \'an administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\' SEC v. Chenery Corp., <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/80/case.html#95">318 U.S. 80, 95</a> (1943). Thus, when the reviewing court here determined that the agency applied an erroneous standard of proof in its determination, it was barred from going on to consider whether the agency\'s action was supported by substantial evidence. The court compounded the error by upsetting two of the agency\'s findings as to reasonableness and upholding the agency solely on the basis of the third finding. The Examiner\'s report, adopted by the Commission, explicitly states that the conclusion was based on \'all things considered,\' not merely the finding of diversion. Finally, the applicable statute provides: </p><ul>\'In the exercise of its powers to prescribe just and reasonable rates the Commission shall give due consideration, among other factors, to the effect of rates on the movement of traffic by the carrier or carriers for which the rates are prescribed ....\'4</ul> <p> It is apparent from a reading of the statute that the likelihood of diversion cannot be an independent ground if the court determines, as it took upon itself to determine here, that the other factors involved do not support the Commission\'s conclusion as to reasonableness. Thus, the court was in error not only in reviewing the evidence after it determined the standard to be erroneous, but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="935">Page 400 U.S. 932 , 935</a></p><p> was in error in two respects when it did evaluate the evidence. </p><p> It may well be that, had the Commission acted in light of the District Court\'s findings as to the standard of proof, it would have found that the proposed charge was just and reasonable. We cannot assume, any more than the District Court could properly assume, that the finding of an unreasonable charge would have the support of substantial evidence. As the Court said in Chenery, supra, </p><ul>\'The Commission\'s action cannot be upheld merely because findings might have been made and considerations disclosed which would justify its order as an appropriate safeguard for the interests protected by the Act. There must be such a responsible finding. There is no such finding here.\' 318 U.S., at 94 (citation omitted).</ul> <p> By affirming the District Court, this Court gives its tacit approval to a procedure which is not in accord with accepted procedures of judicial review of agency actions. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the proceedings to the ICC. </p><p> Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> \'...

There is no separate charge for transiting cotton at most points in the South, or for transiting molasses at Jacksonville, Florida, and in the instant proceedings the appellants sought to impose the separate charge on such commodities at these points. The original proposal included grain and grain products, but the appellants did not contest the Examiner\'s decision before the full Commission. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> Convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1336. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> 49 U.S.C. 15a(2) (emphasis added). </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
