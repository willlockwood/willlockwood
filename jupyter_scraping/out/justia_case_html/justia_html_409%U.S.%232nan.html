Klementova was indicted, tried, and acquitted of charges of violating 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 545 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] by willfully and knowingly, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="233">Page 409 U. S. 233</a></p><p> with intent to defraud the United States, smuggling the articles into the United States without submitting to the required customs procedures.  Following the acquittal, the Government instituted a forfeiture action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 545 and \xc2\xa7 497 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 728, 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1497. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Klementova intervened in the proceeding and argued that his acquittal of charges of violating 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 545 barred the forfeiture.  The District Court held that the forfeiture was barred by collateral estoppel and the Fifth Amendment.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that a forfeiture action pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1497 was not barred by an acquittal of charges of violating 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 545.  We grant certiorari, affirm, and thereby resolve a conflict among the circuits as to whether a forfeiture is barred in these circumstances. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 409 U. S. 234</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Collateral estoppel would bar a forfeiture under \xc2\xa7 1497 if, in the earlier criminal proceeding, the elements of a \xc2\xa7 1497 forfeiture had been resolved against the Government.  <em>Ashe v. Swenson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/436/case.html">397 U. S. 436</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/436/case.html#443">397 U. S. 443</a></span> (1970).  But, in this case, acquittal on the criminal charge did not necessarily resolve the issues in the forfeiture action.  For the Government to secure a conviction under \xc2\xa7 545, it must prove the physical act of unlawful importation as well as a knowing and willful intent to defraud the United States.  An acquittal on the criminal charge may have involved a finding that the physical act was not done with the requisite intent.  Indeed, the court that tried the criminal charge specifically found that the Government had failed to establish intent. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To succeed in a forfeiture action under \xc2\xa7 1497, on the other hand, the Government need only prove that the property was brought into the United States without the required declaration; the Government bears no burden with respect to intent.  Thus, the criminal acquittal may not be regarded as a determination that the property was not unlawfully brought into the United States, and the forfeiture </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 409 U. S. 235</a></p><p> proceeding will not involve an issue previously litigated and finally determined between these parties. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, the difference in the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases precludes application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.  The acquittal of the criminal charges may have only represented "<em>an adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\'"  <em>Helvering v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/case.html">303 U.

As to the issues raised, it does not constitute an adjudication on the preponderance of the evidence burden applicable in civil proceedings.  <em>See Murphy v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/630/case.html">272 U. S. 630</a></span> (1926); <em>Stone v.

S. 178</a></span> (1897).\n</em></p>\n<p>If for no other reason, the forfeiture is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it involves neither two criminal trials nor two criminal punishments.</p>\n<p>"Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission, for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 409 U. S. 236</a></p><p> punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense."</p>\n<p><em>Helvering v. Mitchell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/case.html#399">303 U. S. 399</a></span>.  <em>See also United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/537/case.html">317 U. S. 537</a></span> (1943). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Forfeiture under \xc2\xa7 1497 is a civil sanction.  The provision was originally enacted as \xc2\xa7 497 of the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 964.  The Tariff Act of 1930 reenacted the forfeiture remedy, 46 Stat. 728, and added \xc2\xa7 593, 46 Stat. 751, which became 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 545.  The forfeiture provision fell within Title IV of the Act, which contained the "Administrative Provisions."  Part III of that title, of which \xc2\xa7 1497 was a part, dealt with "Ascertainment, Collection, and Recovery of Duties."  Section 545, on the other hand, was part of the "Enforcement Provisions," and became part of the Criminal Code of the United States.  The fact that the sanctions were separate and distinct and were contained in different parts of the statutory scheme is relevant in determining the character of the forfeiture.  Congress could and did order both civil and criminal sanctions, clearly distinguishing them.  There is no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 409 U. S. 237</a></p><p> reason for frustrating that design.  <em>See Helvering v. Mitchell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/case.html#404">303 U. S. 404</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The \xc2\xa7 1497 forfeiture is intended to aid in the enforcement of tariff regulations.  It prevents forbidden merchandise from circulating in the United States, and, by its monetary penalty, it provides a reasonable form of liquidated damages for violation of the inspection provisions and serves to reimburse the Government for investigation and enforcement expenses.  In other contexts, we have recognized that such purposes characterize remedial, rather than punitive, sanctions.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/391/case.html#401">303 U.

Moreover, it cannot be said that the measure of recovery fixed by Congress in \xc2\xa7 1497 is so unreasonable or excessive that it transforms what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.  <em>Rex Trailer Co. v.

It appears that the \xc2\xa7 1497 forfeiture is civil and remedial, and, as a result, its imposition is not barred by an acquittal of charges of violating \xc2\xa7 545.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Whoever knowingly and willfully, with intent to defraud the United States, smuggles, or clandestinely introduces into the United States any merchandise which should have been invoiced, or makes out or passes, or attempts to pass, through the customhouse any false, forged, or fraudulent invoice, or other document or paper; or"</p>\n<p>"Whoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings into the United States, any merchandise contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise after importation, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law -- "</p>\n<p>"Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."</p>\n<p>"Proof of defendant\'s possession of such goods, unless explained to the satisfaction of the jury, shall be deemed evidence sufficient to authorize conviction for violation of this section."</p>\n<p>"Merchandise introduced into the United States in violation of this section, or the value thereof, to be recovered from any person described in the first or second paragraph of this section, shall be forfeited to the United States."</p>\n<p>"The term \'United States,\' as used in this section, shall not include the Philippine Islands, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Islands, Kingman Reef, Johnston Island, or Guam."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1497 provides:</p>\n<p>"Any article not included in the declaration and entry as made, and, before examination of the baggage was begun, not mentioned in writing by such person, if written declaration and entry was required, or orally if written declaration and entry was not required, shall be subject to forfeiture and such person shall be liable to a penalty equal to the value of such article."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>United State v.
