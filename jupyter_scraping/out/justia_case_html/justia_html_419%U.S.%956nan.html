After a number of raids in which these motion pictures were seized for lack of a proper license from the Maryland State Board of Censors, appellant sought injunctive relief against the enforcement of Maryland\'s film licensing requirements on the grounds that such requirements violate the freedoms protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We held a predecessor Maryland statute unconstitutional in Freedman v. Maryland, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html">380 U.S. 51</a>, the three- judge District Court, however, concluded that the defects identified in Freedman had been remedied by the present statute. 352 F.Supp. 530; 375 F.

I have previously set forth, at some length, my view that no form of censorship, no matter how speedy or efficient it may be, is constitutionally permissible. The cost and delay involved in contesting an adverse determination by the censor provide a very practical deterrent to free and open expression; the inevitable result is a reluctance even to attempt to disseminate ideas which, by virtue of their content, may attract the censor\'s attention or draw his wrath. Moreover, by imposing his sanctions in advance, the censor circumvents all the protections of the Bill of Rights which are called into play by a criminal prosecution after the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="957">Page 419 U.S. 956 , 957</a></p><p> fact.
