Hazard, 102 U.S.  81 (1880)</h3><p><b>Menasha v. Hazard</b></p><p><b>102 U.S. 81</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>1. A town in Wisconsin, being thereunto authorized by law, subscribed for stock in a railroad company and issued its bonds in payment therefor, each reciting that it "shall be valid only when it is thereon duly certified that the conditions upon which it was voted, issued, and deposited by said town have been performed."  Suit was brought on the bonds by a party who in good faith purchased them before they matured.  <em>Held</em> that the certificate on the bonds (<em>infra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/81/case.html#87">102 U. S. 87</a></span>) is in proper form, estopping the town from denying their validity and placing them in a condition to be put on the market as commercial paper.</p>\n<p>2. Where, before the subscription and bonds were voted, the company was authorized to consolidate with other companies constructing connecting lines, and such consolidation was effected, <em>held</em> that the issue of the bonds to the consolidated company was lawful.</p>\n<p>3. <em>County of Scotland v. Thomas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/682/case.html">94 U. S. 682</a></span>, and <em>Wilson v. Salamanca,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/499/case.html">99 U. S. 499</a></span>, approved.</p>\n<p>This was an action by Rowland G. Hazard against the Town of Menasha and the City of Menasha, upon interest coupons detached from bonds of the Town of Menasha, payable to the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company or bearer.  On the trial of the issues, it appeared:</p>\n<p>I. That the Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company made to said town the following proposition:</p>\n<p>"The Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company of the State of Wisconsin, a corporation of said state authorized to construct and operate a railroad with one or more tracks, from Doty\'s Island, situated in the Towns of Neenah and Menasha, in the County of Winnebago, northwesterly, via the towns of Weyauwega, Waupaca, Amherst, and Stevens Point, to Bayfield, and thence to Superior on Lake Superior, and requiring the aid of the said Towns of Menasha and Neenah, each in the sum of $50,000, in the construction of that portion of road which lies between said Doty\'s Island and the Wolf River, and being thereto authorized by chapter 126 of the General Laws of 1869, entitled"</p>\n<p>"An Act to authorize certain counties, towns, cities, and villages to aid in the construction of the land grant railroad from Portage City and from Coty\'s Island to Lake Superior,"</p>\n<p>"submits to the said Town of Menasha the following proposition, to wit: "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 102 U.

That on the 4th of June, 1870, an election was held in said town as provided in said act, and a majority of the votes cast in favor of the railroad proposition.</p>\n<p>III. That said proposition was published and voted upon as required by said act, except the third paragraph, which was published in the words following:</p>\n<p>"<em>Third,</em> that the proper officers of said town shall issue said bonds as required by law, and, on notice being received by the chairman of the board of supervisors of said town from the said National Bank of Commerce of New York that this company has deposited therein to the credit of said town the said five hundred full paid shares of its capital stock, he shall deposit or cause to be deposited in said band all of the said bonds, with instructions to said bank or its officers to hold the same on deposit in trust for said town until such time as there shall be filed in said bank a properly authenticated certificate signed by the chief officers of this company and the board of supervisors of said town or the secretary of state of this state that the iron has been laid upon the track of road and cars have been run over the same through from the depot, on Doty\'s Island, or in said town, to the Wolf River, when the said bonds shall become the absolute property of and be held by said bank, subject to the order of this company or its assigns, and which certificate shall authorize and require the president of said bank to certify upon the back of each of said bonds that the conditions upon which the said bonds were voted, issued, and deposited by said town have been performed, and in case this company fail to comply with the said conditions, the said bonds shall be returned to said town on demand of the authorities thereof."</p>\n<p>IV. That the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company deposited with said bank for said town five hundred shares of its common capital stock.</p>\n<p>V. That on or about the 1st of June, 1871, the chairman of the board of supervisors of said town, with the town clerk, made fifty coupon bonds of said town; that thereupon a suit was instituted in the Circuit Court of the County of Winnebago by one Lawson, a taxpayer in said town, on behalf of himself and all other taxpayers, to enjoin the issue of said bonds.  An injunction was allowed and served upon the officers of said town restraining the issue of said particular fifty bonds, but no others under said act, which injunction is still </p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 102 U.

That on Nov. 23, 1870, the said Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company voluntarily consolidated its franchise and capital stock with the Portage, Stevens Point, and Superior Railroad Company, a corporation incorporated by and under chapter 369 of the Laws of Wisconsin, 1870, under an agreement of consolidation filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Wisconsin, Dec. 5, 1870.</p>\n<p>XIV. That on Feb. 4, 1871, the name of the Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company, was changed to the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, under the provisions of chapter 27 of Private and Local Laws of Wisconsin, 1871.  That by chapter 31, General Laws of Wisconsin, 1871, approved March 1, 1871, the said chapter 126 of the General Laws of 1869 was amended as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.  All bonds and other securities which have heretofore been voted by any county, town, incorporated city, or village under the provisions of said chapter 126 of the General Laws of 1869 to said railroad, under its name of Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company, shall be issued and delivered to said company by and under its said name of Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, and such bonds or other securities so issued and delivered shall have in all courts and places and with all parties the same force and effect as though the name of said company had not been changed and the same had been issued and delivered to it under its name of Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company."</p>\n<p>XV. That on July 1, 1871, the said company voluntarily consolidated its franchises and capital stock with the Manitowoc and Minnesota Railroad Company, a corporation incorporated and extended under and by virtue of chapter 342 of the Private and Local Laws of Wisconsin for 1868, chapters 255 and 302 of the Private and Local Laws for 1869, and chapter 476 of the Private and Local Laws for the year 1871, by an agreement thereto filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Wisconsin, July 10, 1871.</p>\n<p>XVI. That by chapter 127 of the General Laws of Wisconsin for 1874 the City of Menasha was incorporated and made </p><p><a class="page-number" name="92">Page 102 U. S. 92</a></p><p> capable of being sued for the indebtedness of said Town of Menasha, and liable to pay three-fourths of any recovery.</p>\n<p>XVII. That the plaintiff bought the bonds of which the coupons are in suit from Gardner Colby, president of the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, for a valuable consideration, without notice, other than appears on the face of the bonds and certificates printed on them, as follows:  Bond No. 16, on Dec. 11, 1873; bonds Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 37, 38, and 39, on Sept. 12, 1874.</p>\n<p>The judges were divided in opinion upon the following questions:</p>\n<p><em>First,</em> whether the coupons executed and delivered, and there being upon the bonds to which they were annexed such certificates as hereinbefore set forth and produced upon the trial by the plaintiff, created a liability against said town in favor of the plaintiff under the pleadings and proofs.</p>\n<p><em>Second,</em> whether the court should have instructed the jury that the construction of such railroad by the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company without constructing the same across Lake Butte des Morts, but securing the right to cross said lake on the bridge of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company under the contract above set forth, was not a performance of the conditions of the proposition to construct a railroad from block 3, in Jones\'s plat, on Doty\'s Island, to Wolf River.</p>\n<p>The court submitted to the jury these two questions:</p>\n<p><em>First,</em> as to the fact, bearing upon the certificate which the text of the bond required, whether, under all the facts presented, there has been a substantial compliance with the terms of the proposition in the terms of the bond.</p>\n<p><em>Second,</em> whether there has been a substantial compliance on the part of the railroad company as to the conditions of the construction of the road between Doty\'s Island and Wolf Creek.</p>\n<p>And as to the latter question, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p>"Now if there is nothing on the bond to render it invalid, the only other question that can arise in the case is whether the consideration for which this bond was given has failed so as to render it inoperative in the hands of the plaintiff.

A town in Wisconsin, being thereunto authorized by law, subscribed for stock in a railroad company and issued its bonds in payment therefor, each reciting that it "shall be valid only when it is thereon duly certified that the conditions upon which it was voted, issued, and deposited by said town have been performed."  Suit was brought on the bonds by a party who in good faith purchased them before they matured.  <em>Held</em> that the certificate on the bonds (<em>infra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/102/81/case.html#87">102 U. S. 87</a></span>) is in proper form, estopping the town from denying their validity and placing them in a condition to be put on the market as commercial paper.</p>\n<p>2. Where, before the subscription and bonds were voted, the company was authorized to consolidate with other companies constructing connecting lines, and such consolidation was effected, <em>held</em> that the issue of the bonds to the consolidated company was lawful.</p>\n<p>3. <em>County of Scotland v.

That by chapter 31, General Laws of Wisconsin, 1871, approved March 1, 1871, the said chapter 126 of the General Laws of 1869 was amended as follows:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.  All bonds and other securities which have heretofore been voted by any county, town, incorporated city, or village under the provisions of said chapter 126 of the General Laws of 1869 to said railroad, under its name of Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company, shall be issued and delivered to said company by and under its said name of Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, and such bonds or other securities so issued and delivered shall have in all courts and places and with all parties the same force and effect as though the name of said company had not been changed and the same had been issued and delivered to it under its name of Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company."</p>\n<p>XV.

That the plaintiff bought the bonds of which the coupons are in suit from Gardner Colby, president of the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, for a valuable consideration, without notice, other than appears on the face of the bonds and certificates printed on them, as follows:  Bond No. 16, on Dec. 11, 1873; bonds Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 37, 38, and 39, on Sept. 12, 1874.</p>\n<p>The judges were divided in opinion upon the following questions:</p>\n<p><em>First,</em> whether the coupons executed and delivered, and there being upon the bonds to which they were annexed such certificates as hereinbefore set forth and produced upon the trial by the plaintiff, created a liability against said town in favor of the plaintiff under the pleadings and proofs.</p>\n<p><em>Second,</em> whether the court should have instructed the jury that the construction of such railroad by the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company without constructing the same across Lake Butte des Morts, but securing the right to cross said lake on the bridge of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company under the contract above set forth, was not a performance of the conditions of the proposition to construct a railroad from block 3, in Jones\'s plat, on Doty\'s Island, to Wolf River.</p>\n<p>The court submitted to the jury these two questions:</p>\n<p><em>First,</em> as to the fact, bearing upon the certificate which the text of the bond required, whether, under all the facts presented, there has been a substantial compliance with the terms of the proposition in the terms of the bond.</p>\n<p><em>Second,</em> whether there has been a substantial compliance on the part of the railroad company as to the conditions of the construction of the road between Doty\'s Island and Wolf Creek.</p>\n<p>And as to the latter question, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p>"Now if there is nothing on the bond to render it invalid, the only other question that can arise in the case is whether the consideration for which this bond was given has failed so as to render it inoperative in the hands of the plaintiff.

S. 93</a></p><p> from block 3 of Jones\'s plat, in the Town of Neenah, on Doty\'s Island, to the Wolf River.  That had to be done, undoubtedly, before these bonds were to be valid -- before there was a sufficient consideration to render them available to the plaintiff in the view that we have taken of the other part of the case."</p>\n<p><em>Third,</em> whether a delivery of the stock of the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, after consolidation with the Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Railroad Company and with the Manitowoc and Minnesota Railroad Company, as hereinbefore set forth, was a compliance with the terms of such proposition.</p>\n<p><em>Fourth,</em> whether said town was authorized to issue its bonds to the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company after the several consolidations hereinbefore set forth.</p>\n<p>Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff against the town for the amount of the coupons sued on, and interest and costs.  The town then removed the case to this Court.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The first question certified in this case is answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>We think that the certificate on the back of the bonds is a substantial compliance with the condition on their face, and the proposition of the railroad company accepted by the town.  The condition as expressed in the bonds is in the exact language of the second article of the proposition, and implies that they shall be considered as fully executed, and that they may be put on the market as valid commercial paper, "when it is thereon duly certified that the conditions upon which they were voted, issued, and deposited by said town have been performed."  To ascertain what "duly" means in this connection, it is necessary to look to the other parts of the proposition, and there we find in article 3 that the bonds, when issued by the proper officers of the town, were to be deposited with the National Bank of Commerce in New York,</p>\n<p>"in trust for said town, until such time as there shall be filed in said bank a properly authenticated certificate, signed by the chief officer of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 102 U. S. 94</a></p><p> company and the chairman of the board of supervisors of said town, or the secretary of state of this state, that the iron has been laid upon the track of road and cars run over the same, through from the depot on Doty\'s Island, or in said town to Wolf River, when the said bonds shall become the absolute property of and be held by said bank, subject to the order of this company, or its assigns, and which certificate shall authorize and require the president of said bank to certify upon the back of each of said bonds that the conditions upon which the said bonds were voted, issued, and deposited by said town have been performed."</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the proposition and the condition on the face of the bond mean that the bonds should become the valid and subsisting obligations of the town when the president of the National Bank of Commerce had certified thereon that the president of the railroad company and the chairman of the board of supervisors of the town had certified to him that the iron had been laid on the track of the road and the cars run over the same from the depot on Doty\'s Island, or in said town, to Wolf River.  This certificate was on the bonds when they were bought by the defendant in error on the market.  In legal effect it was the same as if it contained the words, "that the conditions upon which they [the bonds] were voted, issued, and deposited by said town had been performed," because, by the very terms of the proposition, the certificate of the proper officers was to be conclusive evidence to the president of the bank of that fact, and not only authorize but require him to make the endorsement contemplated.  When, therefore, he certified that he had received, and put on file in his bank, certificates from the proper parties, such as were required as the basis of his action, he did certify to the facts which the proposition said they should conclusively prove.  His statement of what they proved was unimportant.  The proposition settled that.</p>\n<p>The fact that the certificate furnished the bank is signed in the name of the railroad company by the president is not a valid objection.  It was signed by the president, and that is all the proposition required.</p>\n<p>The third and fourth questions are also answered in the affirmative. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="95">Page 102 U. S. 95</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Before the subscription and bonds were voted, the Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Company was authorized to consolidate with other companies "which by law may be authorized to construct connecting lines of road or make such consolidation."  Act approved March 10, and published April 6, 1870.  The Portage, Stevens Point, and Superior Railroad was incorporated March 16, 1870, with express authority to consolidate with the Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Company.  The Wisconsin Central Railroad Company is in fact the name of Portage, Winnebago, and Superior Company as changed by statute, Feb. 4, 1871.  The organization of the company was the same after as before this change.  The Manitowoc and Minnesota Railroad Company was authorized to enter into consolidation agreements by the Act of March 24, 1871, being chapter 476 of Private and Local Laws, Wis., 1871, and the consolidation with the company was actually effected July 1, 1871.  The vote for the bonds was taken June 4, 1870, and the bonds were issued and delivered to the bank Oct. 25, 1871.  Upon this state of facts, we think this case is brought directly within the principles settled in <em>County of Scotland v. Thomas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/682/case.html">94 U. S. 682</a></span>, and <em>Wilson v. Salamanca,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/499/case.html">99 U. S. 499</a></span>.  The authority of the Wisconsin Central Company was to consolidate with any other company that might at any time have the power to enter into such an arrangement.  It was not confined to such companies as then had the power.</p>\n<p>These answers dispose of the case and make it unnecessary to consider the second question certified.  When the bonds were "duly certified" and delivered to the railroad company by the bank, they became, under the agreement of the parties, valid instruments, completely executed in form, and in a condition to be put on the market as commercial paper.  Having on them the necessary certificate, the purchaser need not inquire whether the facts were as certified.  <em>Anthony v. County of Jasper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/101/693/case.html">101 U. S. 693</a></span>.  With the certificate endorsed, the bonds were in legal effect the same as if they had been issued by the proper officers under full authority without the condition which appeared on their face.  Under these circumstances, the condition did not destroy their negotiability.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
