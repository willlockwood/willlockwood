A federal regulation governing the "optional categorically needy" provides that, if only one spouse is eligible for Medicaid, the States must "deem" income of the other spouse, <em>i.e.,</em> consider the latter\'s income as "available" to the Medicaid applicant, for one month after the spouses cease to live together, following which period only the income actually contributed may be considered.  After petitioner wife, as a result of cerebral hemorrhages, was placed in a long-term care facility in Iowa, which has not exercised the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option, her petitioner husband applied for Medicaid assistance on her behalf.  She is part of the optional categorically needy, since she is eligible for, but does not receive, SSI benefits.  Iowa, in calculating the wife\'s Medicaid benefits, "deemed" or attributed income earned by the husband to the wife in a manner inconsistent with the federal regulation.

"Deeming," in the parlance of the Social Security laws and regulations, means that a State determines eligibility by assuming that a portion of the spouse\'s income is "available" to the applicant.  Because an individual\'s eligibility for Medicaid benefits depends in part on the financial resources that are "available" to him, "[d]eeming . . . has the effect of reducing both the number of eligible individuals and the amount of assistance paid to those who qualify."  <em>Schweiker v.

This program was restructured in 1972 by Congress, when it replaced three of the four categorical programs with Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1381 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III).  Fearing that some States might withdraw from the Medicaid program rather than bear the increased costs imposed by the restructuring, Congress offered the States the "\xc2\xa7 209(b) option."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(f).  Under the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option, the States may elect to provide Medicaid assistance only to those individuals who would have been eligible under the State\'s Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972.  In other words, the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option allows the States to avoid the effect of the link between the SSI and Medicaid programs:  States may become either "\xc2\xa7 209(b) States" or "SSI States."</p>\n<p>If a State participates in the Medicaid program without exercising the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option, the State is required to make Medicaid assistance available to all recipients of SSI benefits.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.120 (1980). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  SSI States, however, are not limited to providing Medicaid benefits to SSI recipients.  The Medicaid program offers participating States the option of providing Medicaid assistance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="269">Page 455 U.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Included among the "optional categorically needy," are (1) individuals who would be eligible for, but for some reason are not receiving, SSI benefits and (2) individuals who would be eligible for SSI benefits but for their institutionalized status.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 435.210-435.211 (1980).</p>\n<p>With regard to the "optional categorically needy," the Secretary\'s regulations require the States to "deem" the income and resources of spouses who share the same household.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723(b) (1980).  Where both spouses are eligible for Medicaid, the States must "deem" income for the first six months after the spouses cease to live together.  After this 6-month period, the States may consider only the income and resources actually contributed by one spouse to the other.  \xc2\xa7 435.723(c).  If only one spouse is eligible for Medicaid, a similar rule applies, but the time period is one month, instead of six.  \xc2\xa7 435.723(d). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In effect, \xc2\xa7 435.723 places time limitations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="270">Page 455 U.

The question addressed by the lower courts, and now presented for our decision, is whether this regulation is a permissible exercise of the Secretary\'s authority under the Act to define what income is "available."</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Elvina Herweg has been in a comatose state since August, 1976, as a result of two cerebral hemorrhages.  When she was placed in a long-term care facility, her husband, petitioner Darrell Herweg, applied for Medicaid assistance on Elvina\'s behalf.  Elvina does not receive SSI benefits, although the parties and the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> agree that she is eligible to receive such benefits. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Iowa applied its own formula to determine Elvina\'s eligibility for Medicaid and to ascertain the amount Darrell would be required to contribute toward his wife\'s care.  This formula was based on the income Darrell earned as a butcher and on standard living allowances allowed Darrell and his three children living at home.  In other words, Iowa was "deeming," or attributing, income earned by one spouse to the other.</p>\n<p>Iowa, however, was deeming in a manner inconsistent with the Secretary\'s regulations, which place time limitations upon the States\' ability to consider as available to the applicant his spouse\'s income where the spouses do not share the same household.  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#269">455 U. S. 269</a></span> and this page, and n. 4.  Because Elvina was institutionalized and because Darrell is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="271">Page 455 U. S. 271</a></p><p> eligible for Medicaid, the Secretary\'s regulations prohibit Iowa from considering Darrell\'s income after one month from the time the couple ceased to live together.  <em>See</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723(d) (1980).</p>\n<p>Petitioners filed the instant suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa challenging Iowa\'s "deeming" of the income of a Medicaid applicant\'s spouse. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  After certifying a class of plaintiffs, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the District Court held that \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(17), required Iowa\'s procedures to</p>\n<p>"provide for a factual determination in each instance of the amount of the spouse\'s income which is in fact reasonably available for the support of the institutionalized spouse. . . .  Such determination must give due consideration to the individual obligations and the particular needs of each spouse and family."</p>\n<p>443 F.Supp. 1316, 1319 (1978).  In interpreting \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17), the District Court concluded that "<em>deeming\' is contrary to congressional intent, whether income of the noninstitutionalized spouse is deemed available or unavailable."  <em>Id.</em> at 1320.  The District Court noted that the predecessor to 42 CFR 435.723 (1980) [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] was inconsistent with its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17).  In the District Court\'s view, therefore, the Secretary\'s regulation was inconsistent with </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="272">Page 455 U.

The District Court approved this plan, and petitioners appealed.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided Court.  619 F.2d 1265 (1980) (en banc).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although Elvina Herweg does not receive SSI benefits, the class certified without objection by the District Court includes SSI recipients.  We therefore construe the order entered by the District Court, and the plan adopted by Iowa in response, as applying both to SSI recipients and to the optional categorically needy.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>With regard to recipients of SSI benefits, the District Court\'s order clearly conflicts with \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(10)(A), which requires States not having exercised the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option to provide Medicaid assistance to all SSI recipients. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.120 (1980).  <em>See Beltran v. Myers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/625/case.html">451 U.

The SSI program, contained in Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1382 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. III), contains its own eligibility provisions.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1382(a)(1), 1382c(b), (f)(1).  Pursuant to the District Court\'s order, however, Iowa is permitted to deny  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 455 U. S. 273</a></p><p> Medicaid benefits to institutionalized SSI recipients if, after making an individualized factual determination,Iowa concludes that the income of the SSI recipient\'s spouse should be considered available even though it was not actually contributed.  Because Congress has clearly spoken in this regard, to the extent it permits Iowa to deny Medicaid assistance to SSI recipients, the District Court\'s order cannot stand. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>In requiring individualized determinations of income available to the Medicaid applicant, the District Court held that the Secretary has exceeded his authority in permitting any "deeming" whatsoever.  In <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers,</em> 453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#45">453 U. S. 45</a></span>, however, we held that Congress intended to permit a state Medicaid plan to deem the income from the applicant\'s spouse as part of the available income which the state plan may consider in determining eligibility.  Thus, to the extent that the District Court\'s order forbids deeming under any circumstances, the order conflicts with our decision in <em>Gray Panthers.</em></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The issue that remains, therefore, is whether \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17) precludes the Secretary from promulgating regulations that impose time limitations upon the States\' ability to consider the income of the institutionalized applicant\'s spouse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="274">Page 455 U.

Subsection (17)(D), respondents argue, evidences Congress\' intent to permit the States to consider the financial responsibility of spouses and parents.  Nothing in the statute or the legislative history, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] respondents contend, suggests that Congress intended to prevent the States from enforcing their financial responsibility policies simply because the Medicaid applicant is institutionalized.  We think, however, that respondents overemphasize the effect of subsection (17)(D).  That provision may not be read independently of subsection (17)(B).  Subsection (17)(B) provides that participating States must grant benefits to eligible individuals</p>\n<p>"taking into account only such income and resources as are, <em>as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary,</em> available to the applicant."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(17)(B) (emphasis added).  In <em>Gray Panthers,</em> we recognized that subsection (17)(B) delegates to the Secretary broad authority to prescribe standards setting eligibility requirements for state Medicaid plans.  In view of Congress\' explicit delegation of authority to give substance to the meaning of "available," the Secretary\'s definition of the term is "<em>entitled to more than mere deference or weight.\'"  </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="275">Page 455 U.

Francis, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/416/case.html#426">432 U. S. 426</a></span>.  As in <em>Gray Panthers</em> and <em>Batterton,</em> our review is limited to determining whether the Secretary has exceeded his statutory authority and whether the regulation is arbitrary and capricious.\n</em></p>\n<p>Although Congress has approved of some deeming of income between Medicaid applicants and their spouses, <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#48">453 U. S. 48</a></span>, we cannot agree with respondents that Congress intended the States to enforce their spousal responsibility policies wholly unimpeded by the Secretary\'s congressionally authorized power to give substance to the term "available."  In placing time limitations upon the States\' ability to consider the spouse\'s income where the Medicaid applicant and his spouse no longer live together, the Secretary has done nothing more than define what income is "available."  Although Congress intended that a spouse\'s income <em>could be</em> part of the income which the Secretary may determine should be considered by the States as available to the Medicaid applicant, <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#45">453 U. S. 45</a></span>, we see nothing in subsection (17)(D) that precludes the Secretary from imposing upon the States the time limits at issue in the instant case.  We find nothing in subsection (17)(D) either that disables the Secretary from defining the term "available" in such circumstances or that gives the States authority to "deem" income unimpeded by the Secretary\'s authority under subsection (17)(B). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Subsection (17)(D) cannot </p><p><a class="page-number" name="276">Page 455 U. S. 276</a></p><p> be read to <em>require</em> the Secretary to permit the States to consider the income of a spouse no longer living with the applicant as available to the applicant for an unlimited duration.</p>\n<p>Although we do not agree with the contention of the United States, and apparently that of petitioners, that the time limitations in 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723 (1980) are <em>compelled</em> by the relationship between the Medicaid and SSI programs, we do agree that the Secretary may acknowledge this relationship in defining "availability" of income with regard to Medicaid applicants within the optional categories.  As we have explained, the optional categorically needy consists, in part, of those individuals who are eligible for, but are not receiving, SSI benefits, and those individuals who, but for their institutionalization, would be eligible for SSI benefits.  <em>Supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#269">455 U. S. 269</a></span>.  Since these groups are defined in part with regard to SSI income limitations, it is reasonable that the Secretary should determine that States electing to provide Medicaid assistance to the optional categorically needy should apply a similar method for calculating income as that employed in the SSI program.  The 1-month and 6-month limitations in 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723 (1980) are virtually identical to the SSI requirements.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1382(a)(1), 1382c(b), (f)(1).  We cannot say that it is either arbitrary or capricious for the Secretary to conclude that SSI recipients and the optional categorically needy should be treated similarly with respect to the method used for calculating income in determining whether the State is entitled to receive federal financial assistance under the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p>In upholding the Secretary\'s limitation on deeming, we do not thereby render subsection (17)(D) meaningless.  That provision, however, may not be read in isolation from the other provisions of the Social Security Act.  We have no doubt that some tension exists between the Secretary\'s congressionally authorized power under subsection (17)(B) to determine what income is "available" to the applicant and Congress\' intent in subsection (17)(D) to permit the States to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="277">Page 455 U. S. 277</a></p><p> enforce their spousal responsibility policies. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Because Congress, in subsection (17)(B), has delegated broad authority to the Secretary to set eligibility standards for the Medicaid program, however, we cannot say that the Secretary\'s regulations placing time limitations on the States\' ability to deem income between spouses who do not share the same household are unreasonable or contrary to law.  A reviewing court may not set aside the Secretary\'s regulations "simply because it would have interpreted the statute in a different manner."  <em>Batterton v. Francis, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/416/case.html#425">432 U. S. 425</a></span>.  <em>A fortiori,</em> Iowa may not ignore federal regulations simply because it interprets \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17) in a manner it considers preferable to the Secretary\'s interpretation.</p>\n<p>This would be a different case, and respondents\' arguments more compelling, if the Secretary had sought to use his authority under subsection (17)(B) to foreclose entirely the States\' ability to consider the income of the institutionalized applicant\'s spouse.  Such a reading of the statute could well render subsection (17)(D) superfluous.  <em>See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers,</em> 453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#45">453 U. S. 45</a></span>.  The Secretary\'s regulations, however, impose no such across-the-board limitation on the States\' ability to implement their spousal responsibility policies.  The challenged regulation applies only to those SSI States that have decided to extend Medicaid benefits to the optional categorically needy, and it prohibits deeming only after the spouses have ceased to live together for prescribed periods of time.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723 (1980) is simply an exception to the general rule that the spouse\'s income may be considered available to the applicant.  With regard to the optional categorically needy, SSI States are <em>required</em> to deem </p><p><a class="page-number" name="278">Page 455 U. S. 278</a></p><p> the income and resources of spouses living in the same household.  \xc2\xa7 435.723(b).  States exercising the \xc2\xa7 209(b) option are <em>required</em> to deem income to the extent required in SSI States, and may deem to the full extent they did before 1972.  \xc2\xa7 435.734.  <em>See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#40">453 U. S. 40</a></span>. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Finally, the SSI applicant is considered to a similar extent to have available to him his spouse\'s income and financial resources.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>We conclude that the Secretary need not interpret \xc2\xa7 1902 (a)(17) to require an individualized factual determination in each instance as to the amount of income of an applicant\'s spouse that may reasonably be considered available to the applicant.  With regard to SSI recipients in SSI States, such an interpretation would be contrary to \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(10)(A), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(10)(A).  With regard to the optional categorically needy, we find that the Secretary has not exceeded his authority in promulgating 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723 (1980), and that this regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1902(a)(17) provides that a state plan for medical assistance must</p>\n<p>"include reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which (A) are consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, (B) provide for taking into account only such income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, available to the applicant or recipient . . .

Iowa is an "SSI State."  This means that, under \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(10)(A), it must develop a plan "for making medical assistance available to all individuals receiving . . . supplemental security income benefits. . . ."  As part of the plan Iowa developed, a noninstitutionalized spouse must contribute toward the care of an institutionalized spouse.  This is explicitly authorized by \xc2\xa7 1902(a)(17)(D), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1396a(a)(17)(D), which prohibits a state from reducing the amount of Medicaid assistance to be made available to a recipient because of the financial responsibility of another person, <em>unless the other person is the recipient\'s spouse or parent.</em> <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#267">455 U.

[<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  In short, I conclude that Iowa\'s "deeming" procedure is authorized by subsection 17(D).</p>\n<p>The Court apparently believes that Iowa overemphasizes the importance of subsection (17)(D).  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#274">455 U. S. 274</a></span>.  It bases its conclusion on subsection (17)(B), which delegates to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the task of determining what income is "available" to an institutionalized spouse.  The applicable regulation promulgated by the Secretary goes 180 degrees contrary to the expressed will of Congress, and prohibits states from taking the income of a noninstitutionalized spouse into account after the month in which the SSI recipient is institutionalized.  42 CFR \xc2\xa7 435.723(d) (1980); <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#269">455 U.

S. 416</a></span> (1977), we held that the Secretary\'s definition of "available" is entitled to great weight.  I do not believe, however, that the Secretary may, by regulation, practically rewrite a portion of the statute.  The statute is entitled to greater weight than the regulation, which was promulgated by the Secretary\'s staff, which apparently regarded the statute as too rigid. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="281">Page 455 U.

S. 277</a></span>, n. 14.  This means that Iowa may sue a noninstitutionalized spouse for partial reimbursement for Medicaid payments under its laws.  All Iowa may not do is "deem" a noninstitutionalized spouse\'s income available to support an institutionalized spouse.  We compared the practicality of family responsibility laws and "deeming" in the 1980 Term, and concluded:</p>\n<p>"It is not \'an answer to say that the state can take action against the spouse to recover that which the spouse was legally obligated to pay.  [It is] unrealistic to think that the state will engage in a multiplicity of continuing individual lawsuits to recover the money that it should not have had to pay out in the first place.  [Because States cannot practically do so, there would be] an open invitation for the spouse to decide that he or she does not wish to make the excess payment.\'  <em>Brown v. Stanton,</em> 617 F.2d 1224, 1234 (CA7 1980) (Pell, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/34/case.html#46">453 U. S. 46</a></span>.  There is nothing in the difference between "SSI states" and "\xc2\xa7 209(b) states" that makes enforcement of family responsibility laws more practical in one than in the other.</p>\n<p>The effect of the Court\'s decision will be to reduce the amount of Medicaid assistance available to those most in need.  As we noted in <em>Gray Panthers,</em> some spouses will accept this open invitation of the "regulators" not to support an institutionalized spouse.  In many cases, noncontributing spouses will get away with not contributing, because the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="282">Page 455 U. S. 282</a></p><p> states will decide that it is not worth the effort to attempt to enforce their state laws.  In other cases, funds that could go to those most in need will be diverted to pay the salaries of the lawyers and others needed to enforce the family responsibility laws.  In both cases, a diversion of funds from those most in need will occur.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s approach also undermines the states\' role as partners in this cooperative federal-state program.  By deciding to become an "SSI state," rather than a "\xc2\xa7 209(b) state," Iowa has chosen to allocate its resources to cover a greater number of people.  By deciding to "deem" a portion of a noninstitutionalized spouse\'s income available to an institutionalized spouse, Iowa can reduce the cost of the additional coverage.  In enacting subsection 17(D), Congress determined that the responsibility of a noninstitutionalized spouse for an institutionalized spouse is a matter best left to the judgment of the states.  Yet the Court today moves the determination of spousal responsibility from the states to a federal agency.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court gets lost in the Medicaid maze, and ends up overruling a statute by giving greater weight to a regulation prepared by an agency staff than to the law as drafted by Congress.  Subsection 17(D) was enacted expressly to permit the states to choose to require that spouses support each other.  The Court seems to overlook that Congress intended to leave these choices to the states, since the regulation, for all practical purposes, prohibits states from making their own decisions based on their own perceptions of local needs.  Since the regulation conflicts with subsection 17(D), it should be held invalid.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>As applied to the tragic facts of this case, Iowa\'s plan required Mr. Herweg to contribute $234.80 each month toward the care of his wife in 1976.  His gross monthly income was $1,350 at that time, and her monthly medical expenses were approximately $1,374.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court admits that this would be a different case if the Secretary issued a regulation totally foreclosing states from "deeming" a noninstitutionalized spouse\'s income available to an institutionalized spouse.  Such a regulation would "render subsection 17(D) superfluous."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#277">455 U. S. 277</a></span>.  Yet the Court approves the prohibition of "deeming" after a prescribed period of institutionalization, in this case, a period of one month.  Moreover, although the Secretary interprets his regulation to prohibit "deeming" after one month of institutionalization, as written, it appears to prohibit "deeming" even sooner.  The regulation prohibits "deeming" "after the month in which" a spouse is institutionalized.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/265/case.html#270">455 U. S. 270</a></span>, n. 4.  Thus, a literal interpretation of the regulation would prohibit "deeming" on February 1 in the case of a spouse institutionalized on January 31.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
