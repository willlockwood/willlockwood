Jones acted after determining, by means of procedures set forth in 4 Cal.Admin.Code c. 8, Art. 5, that the packages were contained in lots [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] whose average net weight was less than the net weight stated on the packages.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We are required to decide only whether the federal laws which govern respondents\' packing operations preclude California from enforcing \xc2\xa7 12211, as implemented by Art. 5.</p>\n<p>Our prior decisions have clearly laid out the path we must follow to answer this question.  The first inquiry is whether Congress, pursuant to its power to regulate commerce, U.S.Const., Art. 1, \xc2\xa7 8, has prohibited state regulation of the particular aspects of commerce involved in this case.  Where, as here, the field which Congress is said to have preempted has been traditionally occupied by the States, <em>see, e.g.,</em> U.S.Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10; <em>Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/171/345/case.html">171 U. S. 345</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/171/345/case.html#358">171 U. S. 358</a></span> (1898),</p>\n<p>"we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/218/case.html">331 U.

This assumption provides assurance that "the federal-state balance," <em>United States v. Bass,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html">404 U. S. 336</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/336/case.html#349">404 U. S. 349</a></span> (1971), will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by the courts.  But when Congress has "unmistakably . . . ordained," <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U.

The standard it establishes is straightforward:</p>\n<p>"[T]he average weight or measure of the packages or containers in a lot of any . . . commodity sampled shall not be less, at the time of sale or offer for sale, than the net weight or measure stated upon the package."</p>\n<p>In order to determine whether that standard has been violated, local officials such as Jones follow the statistical sampling procedure set forth in Art. 5. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  That procedure requires the inspector to identify a lot of identical packages of a commodity and determine the number of packages in that lot.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 430 U. S. 527</a></p><p> He then determines, from tables in the regulation, the number of packages necessary to provide a suitable sample of the lot, and a smaller number of packages which is used to determine the average tare. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  After determining that average, the inspector weighs each package in the sample, subtracts the average tare, and records the difference between the measured and the stated net weights.  These measurements are used to identify individual packages in the sample which deviate unreasonably from the stated weight.  Those packages are replaced [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] in the sample and the replacements weighed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 430 U. S. 528</a></p><p> Finally, the deviations from the stated weight are totaled algebraically and compared with tables which indicate the magnitude of the total error necessary to conclude that the lot\'s average weight is or is not less than the stated weight. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>A. Rath\'s bacon is produced at plants subject to federal inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA or Act), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act, 81 Stat. 584, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 601 <em>et seq.</em>  Among the requirements imposed on federally inspected plants, and enforced by Department of Agriculture inspectors, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] are standards of accuracy in labeling.  On the record before us, we may assume that Rath\'s bacon complies with these standards. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The federal labeling requirement is imposed by \xc2\xa7 7(b) of the FMIA, 81 Stat. 588, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 607(b), which commands:</p>\n<p>"All . . . meat and meat food products inspected at any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 430 U. S. 529</a></p><p> establishment under the authority of this title . . . shall at the time they leave the establishment bear . . . the information required under paragraph (n) of section 1 of this Act."</p>\n<p>Section 1(n) of the FMIA, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 601(n), defines the term "misbranded."  As relevant here, it provides that meat or a meat product is misbranded</p>\n<p>"(5) if in a package or other container unless it bears a label showing . . . (b) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count:  <em>Provided,</em> That . . . reasonable variations may be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages may be established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary."</p>\n<p>81 Stat. 586.  Other sections of the FMIA prohibit dealing in misbranded products, as defined by \xc2\xa7 1 (n). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Agriculture has used his discretionary authority to permit "reasonable variations" in the accuracy of the required statement of quantity:</p>\n<p>"The statement [of net quantity of contents] as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container exclusive of wrappers and packing substances.  Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized.  Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large."</p>\n<p>9 CFR \xc2\xa7 317.2(h)(2) (1976)  Thus, the FMIA, as implemented by statutorily authorized regulations, requires the label of a meat product accurately to indicate the net weight of the contents unless the difference </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 430 U. S. 530</a></p><p> between stated and actual weights is reasonable and results from the specified causes. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>B. Section 408 of the FMIA, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 678, prohibits the imposition of "[m]arking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those made under" the Act. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  This explicit preemption provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 430 U. S. 531</a></p><p> dictates the result in the controversy between Jones and Rath.  California\'s use of a statistical sampling process to determine the average net weight of a lot implicitly allows for variations from stated weight caused by unavoidable deviations in the manufacturing process. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  But California makes no allowance for loss of weight resulting from moisture loss during the course of good distribution practice. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Thus, the state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 430 U. S. 532</a></p><p> law\'s requirement that the label accurately state the net weight, with implicit allowance only for reasonable manufacturing variations -- is "different than" the federal requirement, which permits manufacturing deviations and variations caused by moisture loss during good distribution practice.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Jones seeks to avoid this result by arguing that the FMIA\'s provisions governing the accuracy of the required net quantity statements are not "labeling requirements" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 408.  He contends that "labeling" refers only to the format and placement of information, not to its content. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Requirements relating to accuracy, according to Jones, deal with the problem of misbranding, and \xc2\xa7 408 grants the States concurrent jurisdiction over that subject.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Court of Appeals that this argument is "strained."  530 F.2d at 1314 n. 25.  Nothing in the Act suggests the restrictive meaning petitioner ascribe to the phrase "labeling requirements."  To the contrary, \xc2\xa7 7(b) requires that the product bear specified information, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#528">430 U.

It twists the language beyond the breaking point to say that a law mandating that labeling contain certain information is not a "labeling requirement."</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that, with respect to Rath\'s packaged bacon, \xc2\xa7 12211 and Art. 5 are preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>A. The federal law governing net weight labeling of the millers\' flour is contained in two statutes, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 430 U. S. 533</a></p><p> 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 301 <em>et seq.,</em> and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), 80 Stat. 1296, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1451-1461.  For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the federal weight labeling standard for flour is the same as that for meat.</p>\n<p>The FDCA prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] that is misbranded.  21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 331.  A food is misbranded under the FDCA,</p>\n<p>"[i]f in package form unless it bears a label containing . . . an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count:  <em>Provided,</em> That . . reasonable variations shall be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the Secretary."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 343(e)  This provision is identical to the parallel provision in the FMIA, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#529">430 U. S. 529</a></span>, except that the FDCA mandates, rather than allows, the promulgation of implementing regulations. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The regulation issued in response to this statutory mandate is also substantially identical to its counterpart under the FMIA:</p>\n<p>"The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package.  Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized.  Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large."</p>\n<p>21 CFR \xc2\xa7 1.8b(q) (1976). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 430 U. S. 534</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Since flour is a food under the FDCA, its manufacture is also subject to the provisions of the FPLA.  <em>See</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1452, 1459(a).  That statute states a congressional policy that</p>\n<p>"[p]ackages and their labels should enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents, and should facilitate value comparisons."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1451.  To accomplish those goals, insofar as is relevant here, the FPLA bans the distribution in commerce of any packaged commodity unless it complies with regulations</p>\n<p>"which shall provide that -- "</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(2) The net quantity of contents (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count) shall be separately and accurately stated in a uniform location upon the principal display panel of [the required] label."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1453(a).  The FPLA also contains a saving clause which specifics that nothing in the FPLA "shall be construed to repeal, invalidate, or supersede" the FDCA.  \xc2\xa7 1460.  Nothing in the FPLA explicitly permits any variation between stated weight and actual weight.</p>\n<p>The <em>amici</em> States contend that, since the FPLA does not allow any variations from stated weight, there is no difference between federal law governing labeling of flour and California law.  The Court of Appeals, however, held that, because of the saving clause, compliance with the FDCA, which does allow reasonable variations, satisfies the requirements of the FPLA.  530 F.2d at 1325.  <em>Amici</em> respond that the Court of Appeals misinterpreted the FDCA, and that the FDCA establishes a statutory standard of strict accuracy for net weight labeling.  They argue, therefore, that the saving clause of the FPLA does not alter the standard mandated by \xc2\xa7 1453.  Brief for 39 States as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15-21.  Alternatively, the States argue that, although the saving clause means that the FPLA does not supersede the FDCA, "it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 430 U. S. 535</a></p><p> cannot be construed to excuse compliance with FPLA standards where both FDCA and FPLA requirements are applicable."  <em>Id.</em> at 28.</p>\n<p>The States\' argument that the FDCA standard makes no allowance for reasonable variations is based on this Court\'s opinion in <em>United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/77/case.html">287 U. S. 77</a></span> (1932).  <em>Shreveport</em> decided an appeal by the Government in a criminal case involving shortweighting in violation of the predecessor of the FDCA, the Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, as amended, c. 117, 37 Stat. 732.  The trial court had dismissed the indictment under that statute, which was essentially identical to the net weight labeling requirement of the FDCA, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] on the ground that the prohibition of unreasonable variations from the marked weight was too indefinite to state a criminal offense.  We reversed, holding that the statute\'s substantive standard was created by the "accurate statement" language which preceded the proviso allowing reasonable variations, and that the proviso merely granted administrative authority to promulgate regulations permitting variations "from the hard and fast rule of the act."  287 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/77/case.html#81">287 U. S. 81</a></span>-82.  Since Congress reenacted the language interpreted by the <em>Shreveport</em> Court, FDCA, c. 675, \xc2\xa7 403(e), 52 Stat. 1047, <em>amici</em> conclude that the standard under the FDCA is also a "hard and fast rule."</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether the rationale as well as the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 430 U. S. 536</a></p><p> result of <em>Shreveport</em> remains good law. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  It is clear that 21 CFR \xc2\xa7 1.8b(q) (1976), insofar as it is based on the FDCA, has the force of law, [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] and allows reasonable variations.  Thus, whether the statutory standard is viewed as strict, with the regulation considered a restriction on the power to prosecute, or whether the standard is itself viewed as incorporating the flexibility of the proviso and its implementing regulation, [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] the result is the same.  Under the FDCA, reasonable variations from the stated net weight do not subject a miller to prosecution, whether civil or criminal, if the variations arise from the permitted causes.  The question raised by the arguments of <em>amici</em> is whether, by enacting the FPLA, Congress intended to eliminate the area of freedom from prosecution created by the FDCA and its implementing regulation.</p>\n<p>Over 60 years ago, Congress concluded that variations must be allowed because of the nature of certain foods and the impossibility of developing completely accurate means of packing.  H.R.Rep. No. 850, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 430 U. S. 537</a></p><p> (1912); S.Rep. No. 1216, 62d Cong., 3d Sess., 3 (1913). [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Since 1914, regulations under the food and drug laws have permitted reasonable variations from stated net weight resulting from packing deviations or gain or loss of moisture occurring despite good commercial practice.  <em>See United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/77/case.html#84">287 U. S. 84</a></span>.  If Congress had intended to overrule this longstanding administrative practice, founded on a legislative statement of necessity, we would expect it to have done so clearly.  Instead, it explicitly preserved existing law, with "no changes."  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1460; S.Rep. No. 1186, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 20 (1966).  The legislative history of the FPLA contains some indication that the saving clause was understood to preserve the reasonable variation regulation under the FDCA, [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] and no evidence that Congress affirmatively intended to overrule that regulation. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  We can only conclude that, under the FPLA, as under the FDCA, a manufacturer of food is not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 430 U. S. 538</a></p><p> subject to enforcement action for violation of the net weight labeling requirements if the label accurately states the net weight, with allowance for the specified reasonable variations.</p>\n<p>B. The FDCA contains no preemptive language.  The FPLA, on the other hand, declares that</p>\n<p>"it is the express intent of Congress to supersede any and all laws of the States or political subdivisions thereof insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for the labeling of the net qua[nt]ity of contents of the package of any consumer commodity covered by this chapter which are less stringent than or require information different from the requirements of section 1453 of this title or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto."</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1461. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  The Court of Appeals, although recognizing that this section leaves more scope for state law than does the FMIA, concluded that \xc2\xa7 12211, as implemented by Art. 5, is preempted because it is less stringent than the Federal Acts, 530 F.2d at 1324-1327.</p>\n<p>The basis for the Court of Appeals\' holding is unclear.  Its opinion may be read as based on the conclusion that the state law is inadequate because its enforcement relies on a statistical averaging procedure.  We have rejected that conclusion.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#531">430 U. S. 531</a></span>, and n. 18.  Alternatively, the Court of Appeals may have found California\'s approach less stringent because the State takes no enforcement action against lots whose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 430 U. S. 539</a></p><p> average net weight exceeds the weight stated on the label, even if that excess is not a reasonable variation attributable to a federally allowed cause.</p>\n<p>We have some doubt that, by preempting less stringent state laws, Congress intended to compel the States to expend scarce enforcement resources to prevent the sale of packages which contain more than the stated net weight.  We do not have to reach that question, however, because, in this respect, California law apparently differs not at all from federal law, as applied.  The inspectors responsible for enforcing the net weight labeling provisions of the Federal Acts are officially informed that "[f]ield weighing for net weight is primarily to determine the likelihood of short weight units in the lots."  Moreover, they are not required to submit samples to headquarters "if the average net is not below the amount declared on the label."  Food and Drug Administration, Inspection Operations Manual 448.1, 448.13 (1976).  These instructions undercut the argument that there is a federal interest in preventing packages from being overfilled. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Since neither jurisdiction is concerned with overweighting in the administration of its weights and measures laws, we cannot say that California\'s statutory lack of concern for that "problem" [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] makes its laws less stringent than the federal. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 430 U. S. 540</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents argue that California\'s law is preempted because it requires information different from that required by federal law.  The meaning of the statutory preemption of laws that require "information different from" the federal net weight labeling provisions, like the meaning of the phrase "less stringent," is unclear.  Respondents attribute to the ban on requiring different information a broad meaning, similar in scope to the preemption provision of the FMIA.  They contend that, since California law requires the label to state the minimum net weight, it requires "information different from" the federal laws, which demand an accurate statement with allowance for the specified reasonable variations.  Brief for Respondents 31-32.  The legislative history, however, suggests that the statute expressly preempts as requiring "different information" only state laws governing net quantity labeling which impose requirements inconsistent with those imposed by federal law. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Since it would be possible to comply with the state law without triggering federal enforcement action, we conclude that the state requirement is not inconsistent with federal law.  We therefore hold that 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1461 does not preempt California\'s \xc2\xa7 12211 as implemented by Art. 5.</p>\n<p>That holding does not, however, resolve this case, for we still must determine whether the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 430 U. S. 541</a></p><p> purposes and objectives of Congress."  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#526">430 U. S. 526</a></span>.  As Congress clearly stated, a major purpose of the FPLA is to facilitate value comparisons among similar products.  Obviously, this goal cannot be accomplished unless packages that bear the same indicated weight in fact contain the same quantity of the product for which the consumer is paying.  The significance of this requirement for our purposes results from the physical attributes of flour.</p>\n<p>Flour is composed of flour solids and moisture.  The average water content of wheat kernels used to make flour is 12.5% by weight, with a range from 10% to 14.5%.  Efficient milling practice requires adding water to raise the moisture content to 15% to 16%; if the wheat is to wet or too dry, milling will be hindered.  During milling, the moisture content is reduced to 13% to 14%.   App. 229. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>The moisture content of flour does not remain constant after milling is completed.  If the relative humidity of the atmosphere in which it is stored is greater than 60%, flour will gain moisture, and if the humidity is less than 60%, it will lose moisture. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  The federal net weight labeling standard permits variations from stated weight caused by this gain or loss of moisture.</p>\n<p>Packages that meet the federal labeling requirements [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 430 U. S. 542</a></p><p> and that have the same stated quantity of contents can be expected to contain the same amount of flour solids. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Manufacturers will produce flour with a moisture content fixed by the requirements of the milling process. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Since manufacturers have reason not to pack significantly more than is required, and federal law prohibits underpacking, they will pack the same amount of this similarly composed flour into packages of any given size. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  Despite any changes in weight resulting from changes in moisture content during distribution, the packages will contain the same amount of flour solids when they reach the consumer.  This identity of contents facilitates consumer value comparisons.</p>\n<p>The State\'s refusal to permit reasonable weight variations resulting from loss of moisture during distribution produces a different effect. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  In order to be certain of meeting the California standard, a miller must ensure that loss of moisture during distribution will not bring the weight of the contents below the stated weight.  Local millers, which serve a limited area, could do so by adjusting their packing practices to the specific humidity conditions of their region.  For example, a miller in an area where the humidity is typically higher than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 430 U. S. 543</a></p><p> 60% would not need to overpack at all.  By contrast, a miller with a national marketing area would not know the destination of its flour when it was packaged and would therefore have to assume that the flour would lose weight during distribution.  The national manufacturer, therefore, would have to overpack.</p>\n<p>Similarly, manufacturers who distributed only in States that followed the federal standard would not be concerned with compensating for possible moisture loss during distribution.  National manufacturers who did not exclude the nonconforming States from their marketing area, on the other hand, would have to overpack.  Thus, as a result of the application of the California standard, consumers throughout the country who attempted to compare the value of identically labeled packages of flour would not be comparing packages which contained identical amounts of flour solids.  Value comparisons which did not account for this difference -- and there would be no way for the consumer to make the necessary calculations -- would be misleading.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that, with respect to the millers\' flour, enforcement of \xc2\xa7 12211, as implemented by Art. 5, would prevent "the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress" in passing the FPLA.  Under the Constitution, that result is impermissible, and the state law must yield to the federal.</p>\n<p>The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with <em>Jones, Director, Department of Weights and Measures, Riverside County v.

Bacon loses moisture to its wrapping materials and to the atmosphere.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F10" name="T10">n</a> 10, <em>supra.</em>  The rate of loss to the atmosphere in a typical retail showcase is 0.3/16 to 0.4/16 of an ounce per day.  App. 95.  In addition, since bacon is cut in discrete slices, it is impossible to guarantee that each package will contain exactly the stated weight when packed.  Instead of seeking exactitude, Rath approved packages if they were within 5/16 of an ounce of a target weight.  Prior to petitioner\'s enforcement activities, and the similar activities of Becker, <em>see</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra,</em> Rath\'s target weight was 3/16 of an ounce over the stated weight, or 1 lb. 3/16 oz. for a one-pound package.  Thus, a package would be passed if it weighed between 15 14/16 oz. and 1 lb. 8/16 oz.  In response to the California enforcement measures, Rath raised its target weight to 8/16 oz. over stated net weight for bacon packed on a polyethylene insert, and 116 oz. over stated weight for bacon packed on wax boards.  App. 889.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 408, 81 Stat. 600, states in full:</p>\n<p>"Requirements within the scope of this Act with respect to premises, facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under title I of this Act, which are in addition to, or different than those made under this Act may not be imposed by any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, except that any such jurisdiction may impose recordkeeping and other requirements within the scope of section 202 of this Act if consistent therewith, with respect to any such establishment.

The average weight of the sample should equal the target weight, <em>see</em> <a href="#F16" name="T16">n</a> 16, <em>supra,</em> with allowance for sampling variation and moisture loss.

Accordingly, we disagree with anything in the opinions below that suggests that States may not use valid statistical sampling techniques, including reliance on lot average weights, to police compliance with federal and valid state net weight labeling laws.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Moisture loss during distribution will, obviously, cause the net weight of bacon to be less than it was when the bacon left the packing plant.

I am unable to agree, however, with the implicit preemption the Court finds with respect to the flour.  This latter preemption is founded in unwarranted speculations that hardly rise to that clear demonstration of conflict that must exist before the mere existence of a federal law may be said to preempt state law operating in the same field.</p>\n<p>With respect to labeling requirements for flour under the scheme contemplated by the FPLA in conjunction with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Court determines that the state law labeling requirements are neither "less stringent than" nor inconsistent with those federal requirements.  This conclusion quite properly dictates the Court\'s holding that Congress has not expressly prohibited state regulation in this field.  The remaining inquiry, then, is whether the two statutory schemes are in utter conflict. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  As this Court noted in <em>Kelly v.

I am simply unable to find that this stringent standard has been met in this case.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion demonstrates that it is physically possible to comply with the state law requirement "without triggering federal enforcement action," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#540">430 U.

Preemption, then, if it is to exist at all in this case, must exist because the operation of the state Act inexorably conflicts with the purposes underlying the Federal Act.  The Court relies on the fact that one of the purposes of the FPLA is to "facilitate value comparisons" among consumers, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1451.  But merely identifying a purpose is not enough; it must also be shown that the state law inevitably frustrates that purpose.

First, on the Court\'s own premises, there should be no finding of preemption.  We are told, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#526">430 U. S. 526</a></span>, that the relevant inquiry is "the relationship between state and federal laws as they are interpreted and applied, not merely as they are written," while we are further told, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#539">430 U. S. 539</a></span>, that there is, in fact, no "federal interest in preventing packages from being overfilled," since the Federal Government is not "concerned with overweighting in the administration of its weights and measures laws. . . ."  Under these premises, it is hard to accept the Court\'s conclusion that, because of the federal purpose to facilitate consumer value comparisons, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] the state law is preempted because some packages might contain more than the minimum weight stated and more than another company\'s similarly marked package.  For we have been told that, should a manufacturer deliberately overpack, for whatever reason, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] there will be no federal action taken against him even though value comparisons might then "be misleading."  It is virtually impossible to say, as the Court does, that "neither the State nor the Federal Government is concerned with overweighting," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 430 U. S. 547</a></p><p> <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#542">430 U. S. 542</a></span> n. 41, and yet conclude that state-induced overweighting conflicts with a "value comparison" purpose, while, presumably, other overweighting does not.  In viewing such a purpose to be sufficient to require preemption while the very purpose is ignored in practice by the administering federal agency reverses the normal presumption against finding preemption.  The reasoning process which leads the Court to conclude that there is no express preemption, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#540">430 U. S. 540</a></span>, leads me to conclude that there is no implied preemption. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, and as troubling as the legal inconsistency, is the Court\'s reliance on unproved factual speculation in demonstrating the purported irreconcilable undermining of the federal purpose by the state statutory scheme.  The premises the opinion must rely on are many.  It acknowledges that flour packed under different humidity conditions would nonetheless comply with the federal standard, even though, as a result, similarly marked packages might contain different quantities of flour "solids," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#542">430 U. S. 542</a></span>, and n. 39, but relies on the economics of the milling process to conclude that packers "will pack the same amount of [flour solids] into packages of any given size."  This may normally be true as an economic fact, but it is not supported by the record, and, as a Court, we have no way of knowing it from other sources.</p>\n<p>Similarly defective is the reasoning process by which the majority concludes that local millers could adjust their packaging practices to specific humidity conditions, while national millers could not, since the national millers</p>\n<p>"would not know the destination of [their] flour when it was packaged, and would therefore have to assume that the flour would lose weight during distribution."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/519/case.html#543">430 U. S. 543</a></span>.  This assumption, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 430 U. S. 548</a></p><p> too, is unsupported by the record. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  We simply have no basis for concluding that national distributors do not know, or could not know through the exertion of some modicum of effort, where their flour will end up.  The possibility that a packer might have to incur some extra expense in meeting both systems simply does not mean that the "purposes of the act cannot otherwise be accomplished," <em>Savage v. Jones,</em> 225 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/225/501/case.html#533">225 U.

S. 549</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The assumptions in the Court\'s opinion not only are insufficient to compel a finding of implied preemption, they suggest an approach to the question of preemption wholly at odds with that enunciated in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span> (1963).  There, this Court was concerned with differing federal and state maturity standards for avocados grown in Florida.  This Court rejected a test which looked to the similarity of purposes, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Because reliance on this test to find preemption, absent an explicit preemptive clause, seriously misapprehends the carefully delimited nature of the doctrine of preemption, <em>Goldstein v.

S. 540</a></span>, does not reflect on the fact that the state statutory scheme does not inevitably conflict with the federal.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reliance on the possible differential effect of California\'s requirements on local and national millers is itself wholly speculative.  To begin with, we do not know from the record that there are both "local" and "national" millers, however defined.  Even if both exist, we simply do not know that local millers will ship flour only to ares with comparable humidity levels.  Any miller might experience a variety of humidity conditions by shipping to two different areas, despite the fact that his operation may be considered local in that the two areas are relatively contiguous.  Even in the same town, stores that are air-conditioned may have significantly different humidity conditions than exist elsewhere in the town.  In such situations, the local millers would have to adjust their packing process to account for this differential, either by packing different quantities into different packages, and then tracing their distribution, or by overpacking all packages sufficiently to ensure that any possible humidity conditions could be met.  The same would appear to be true for national millers.  We simply, then, do not know that local millers and national millers would not be similarly affected.  The Court\'s assertions to the contrary are nothing but speculations.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>For all that appears, packers could easily adjust their processes so as to insure compliance with the purposes of both Acts.  Even if such adjustment should entail a minor economic inconvenience, it has nowhere been demonstrated that the imposition of a moderate economic burden conflicts with the purpose of the federal statutory scheme.  California, in the exercise of its police powers, may be deemed to have believed that the benefits of its enactment outweigh these costs.  Unless it call be shown that additional cost itself conflicts with a clear congressional purpose, the presumption is that our federal system of government tolerates such costs.  And if added costs will vitiate the conflict, I do not see how it can be said that the statutory schemes necessarily conflict, rather than just "may possibly" conflict.  <em>Goldstein v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/546/case.html">412 U.
