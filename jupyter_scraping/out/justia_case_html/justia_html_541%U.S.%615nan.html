Argued March 31, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 24, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Before Officer Nichols could pull over petitioner, petitioner parked and got out of his car.  Nichols then parked, accosted petitioner, and arrested him after finding drugs in his pocket.  Incident to the arrest, Nichols searched petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s car and found a handgun under the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.  Petitioner was charged with federal drug and firearms violations.  In denying his motion to suppress the firearm as the fruit of an unconstitutional search, the District Court found, <em>inter alia,</em> the automobile search valid under <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/index.html">453 U. S. 454</a>, in which this Court held that, when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an automobile\xe2\x80\x99s occupant, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to search the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of arrest, <em>id.,</em> at 460.  Petitioner appealed his conviction, arguing that <em>Belton</em> was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact with an arrestee while he was still in the car.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0<em>Belton</em> governs even when an officer does not make contact until the person arrested has left the vehicle.  In <em>Belton,</em> the Court placed no reliance on the fact that the officer ordered the occupants out of the vehicle, or initiated contact with them while they remained within it.  And here, there is simply no basis to conclude that the span of the area generally within the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control is determined by whether the arrestee exited the vehicle at the officer\xe2\x80\x99s direction, or whether the officer initiated contact with him while he was in the car.  In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer safety and evidence destruction as one who is inside.  Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9ccontact initiation\xe2\x80\x9d rule, officers who decide that it may be safer and more effective to conceal their presence until a suspect has left his car would be unable to search the passenger compartment in the event of a custodial arrest, potentially compromising their safety and placing incriminating evidence at risk of concealment or destruction.  The Fourth Amendment does not require such a gamble.  <em>Belton</em> allows police to search a car\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment incident to a lawful arrest of both \xe2\x80\x9coccupants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  While an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s status as a \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant\xe2\x80\x9d may turn on his temporal or spatial relationship to the car at the time of the arrest and search, it certainly does not turn on whether he was inside or outside the car when the officer first initiated contact with him.  Although not all contraband in the passenger compartment is likely to be accessible to a \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant,\xe2\x80\x9d the need for a clear rule, readily understood by police and not depending on differing estimates of what items were or were not within an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s reach at any particular moment, justifies the sort of generalization which <em>Belton</em> enunciated.  Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rule, an officer would have to determine whether he actually confronted or signaled confrontation with the suspect while he was in his car, or whether the suspect exited the car unaware of, and for reasons unrelated to, the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  Such a rule would be inherently subjective and highly fact specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad\xc2\xa0hoc determinations on the part of officers in the field and reviewing courts that <em>Belton</em> sought to avoid.

S. 454</a> (1981), we held that when a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an occupant of an automobile, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to search the passenger compartment of that vehicle as a contemporaneous incident of arrest.  We have granted certiorari twice before to determine whether <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule is limited to situations where the officer makes contact with the occupant while the occupant is inside the vehicle, or whether it applies as well when the officer first makes contact with the arrestee after the latter has stepped out of his vehicle.  We did not reach the merits in either of those two cases.  <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Gant</em>, 540 U. S. ___ (2003) (vacating and remanding for reconsideration in light of <em>State</em> v. <em>Dean</em>, 206 Ariz. 158, 76 P. 3d 429 (2003)); <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Thomas, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/774/index.html">532 U. S. 774</a> (2001) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction).  We now reach that question and conclude that <em>Belton</em> governs even when an officer does not make contact until the person arrested has left the vehicle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Officer Deion Nichols of the Norfolk, Virginia, Police Department, who was in uniform but driving an unmarked police car, first noticed petitioner Marcus Thornton when petitioner slowed down so as to avoid driving next to him.  Nichols suspected that petitioner knew he was a police officer and for some reason did not want to pull next to him.  His suspicions aroused, Nichols pulled off onto a side street and petitioner passed him.  After petitioner passed him, Nichols ran a check on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s license tags, which revealed that the tags had been issued to a 1982 Chevy two-door and not to a Lincoln Town Car, the model of car petitioner was driving.  Before Nichols had an opportunity to pull him over, petitioner drove into a parking lot, parked, and got out of the vehicle.  Nichols saw petitioner leave his vehicle as he pulled in behind him.  He parked the patrol car, accosted petitioner, and asked him for his driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.  He also told him that his license tags did not match the vehicle that he was driving.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner appeared nervous.  He began rambling and licking his lips; he was sweating.  Concerned for his safety, Nichols asked petitioner if he had any narcotics or weapons on him or in his vehicle.  Petitioner said no.  Nichols then asked petitioner if he could pat him down, to which petitioner agreed.  Nichols felt a bulge in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s left front pocket and again asked him if he had any illegal narcotics on him.  This time petitioner stated that he did, and he reached into his pocket and pulled out two individual bags, one containing three bags of marijuana and the other containing a large amount of crack cocaine.  Nichols handcuffed petitioner, informed him that he was under arrest, and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car.  He then searched petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle and found a BryCo .9-millimeter handgun under the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A grand jury charged petitioner with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7841(a)(1), possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1).  Petitioner sought to suppress, <em>inter alia</em>, the firearm as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.  After a hearing, the District Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress, holding that the automobile search was valid under <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton,</em> <em>supra, </em>and alternatively that Nichols could have conducted an inventory search of the automobile.  A jury convicted petitioner on all three counts; he was sentenced to 180 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment and 8 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner appealed, challenging only the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the suppression motion.  He argued that <em>Belton</em> was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact with an arrestee while he was still an occupant of the car.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d 189 (2003).  It held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe historical rationales for the search incident to arrest doctrine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 195 (quoting <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Iowa, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/113/index.html">525 U. S. 113</a>, 116 (1998)), did not require <em>Belton</em> to be limited solely to situations in which suspects were still in their vehicles when approached by the police.  Noting that petitioner conceded that he was in \xe2\x80\x9cclose proximity, both temporally and spatially,\xe2\x80\x9d to his vehicle, the court concluded that the car was within petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control, and thus Nichols\xe2\x80\x99 search was reasonable under <em>Belton</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 196.  We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. ___ (2003), and now affirm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Belton</em>, an officer overtook a speeding vehicle on the New York Thruway and ordered its driver to pull over.  453 U. S., at 455.  Suspecting that the occupants possessed marijuana, the officer directed them to get out of the car and arrested them for unlawful possession.  <em>Id</em>., at 454\xe2\x80\x93455.  He searched them and then searched the passenger compartment of the car.  <em>Id</em>., at 455.  We considered the constitutionally permissible scope of a search in these circumstances and sought to lay down a workable rule governing that situation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first referred to <em>Chimel</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/752/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/752/index.html">395 U. S. 752</a> (1969), a case where the arrestee was arrested in his home, and we had described the scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest as the person of the arrestee and the area immediately surrounding him.  453 U. S., at 457 (citing <em>Chimel</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 763).  This rule was justified by the need to remove any weapon the arrestee might seek to use to resist arrest or to escape, and the need to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence.  453 U. S., at 457.  Although easily stated, the <em>Chimel</em> principle had proved difficult to apply in specific cases.  We pointed out that in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Robinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/218/index.html">414 U. S. 218</a> (1973), a case dealing with the scope of the search of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s person, we had rejected a suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there must be litigated in each case the issue of whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to conduct such a search.  453 U. S., at 459 (quoting <em>Robinson</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 235).  Similarly, because \xe2\x80\x9ccourts ha[d] found no workable definition of the \xe2\x80\x98area within the immediate control of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99 when that area arguably include[d] the interior of an automobile and the arrestee [wa]s its recent occupant,\xe2\x80\x9d 453 U. S., at 460, we sought to set forth a clear rule for police officers and citizens alike.  We therefore held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In so holding, we placed no reliance on the fact that the officer in <em>Belton</em> ordered the occupants out of the vehicle, or initiated contact with them while they remained within it.  Nor do we find such a factor persuasive in distinguishing the current situation, as it bears no logical relationship to <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale.  There is simply no basis to conclude that the span of the area generally within the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control is determined by whether the arrestee exited the vehicle at the officer\xe2\x80\x99s direction, or whether the officer initiated contact with him while he remained in the car.  We recognized as much, albeit in dicta, in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Long,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1032/index.html">463 U. S. 1032</a> (1983), where officers observed a speeding car swerve into a ditch.  The driver exited and the officers met him at the rear of his car.  Although there was no indication that the officers initiated contact with the driver while he was still in the vehicle, we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is clear \xe2\x80\xa6 that if the officers had arrested [respondent] \xe2\x80\xa6 they could have searched the passenger compartment under <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1035\xe2\x80\x931036, and n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer safety and the destruction of evidence as the arrest of one who is inside the vehicle.  An officer may search a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle under <em>Belton</em> only if the suspect is arrested.  See <em>Knowles, supra</em>, at 117\xe2\x80\x93118.  A custodial arrest is fluid and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he danger to the police officer flows from <em>the fact of the arrest</em>, and its attendant proximity, stress, and uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Robinson,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 234\xe2\x80\x93235, and n.\xc2\xa05 (emphasis added).  See <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Chrisman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/1/index.html">455 U. S. 1</a>, 7 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvery arrest must be presumed to present a risk of danger to the arresting officer\xe2\x80\x9d).  The stress is no less merely because the arrestee exited his car before the officer initiated contact, nor is an arrestee less likely to attempt to lunge for a weapon or to destroy evidence if he is outside of, but still in control of, the vehicle.  In either case, the officer faces a highly volatile situation.  It would make little sense to apply two different rules to what is, at bottom, the same situation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some circumstances it may be safer and more\neffective for officers to conceal their presence from a suspect until he has left his vehicle.  Certainly that is a judgment officers should be free to make.  But under the strictures of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9ccontact initiation\xe2\x80\x9d rule, officers who do so would be unable to search the car\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment in the event of a custodial arrest, potentially compromising their safety and placing incriminating evidence at risk of concealment or destruction.  The Fourth Amendment does not require such a gamble.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues, however, that <em>Belton</em> will fail to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line\xe2\x80\x9d rule if it applies to more than vehicle \xe2\x80\x9coccupants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 29\xe2\x80\x9334.  But <em>Belton</em> allows police to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a lawful custodial arrest of both \xe2\x80\x9coccupants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupants.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 U. S., at 460.  Indeed, the respondent in <em>Belton</em> was not inside the car at the time of the arrest and search; he was standing on the highway.  In any event, while an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s status as a \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant\xe2\x80\x9d may turn on his temporal or spatial relationship to the car at the time of the arrest and search,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] it certainly does not turn on whether he was inside or outside the car at the moment that the officer first initiated contact with him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, not all contraband in the passenger compartment is likely to be readily accessible to a \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is unlikely in this case that petitioner could have reached under the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat for his gun once he was outside of his automobile.  But the firearm and the passenger compartment in general were no more inaccessible than were the contraband and the passenger compartment in <em>Belton</em>.  The need for a clear rule, readily understood by police officers and not depending on differing estimates of what items were or were not within reach of an arrestee at any particular moment, justifies the sort of generalization which <em>Belton</em> enunciated.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Once an officer determines that there is probable cause to make an arrest, it is reasonable to allow officers to ensure their safety and to preserve evidence by searching the entire passenger compartment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than clarifying the constitutional limits of a <em>Belton</em> search, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontact initiation\xe2\x80\x9d rule would obfuscate them.  Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule, an officer approaching a suspect who has just alighted from his vehicle would have to determine whether he actually confronted or signaled confrontation with the suspect while he remained in the car, or whether the suspect exited his vehicle unaware of, and for reasons unrelated to, the officer\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  This determination would be inherently subjective and highly fact specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad\xc2\xa0hoc determinations on the part of officers in the field and reviewing courts that <em>Belton</em> sought to avoid.  <em>Id., </em>at 459\xe2\x80\x93460.  Experience has shown that such a rule is impracticable, and we refuse to adopt it.  So long as an arrestee is the sort of \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant\xe2\x80\x9d of a vehicle such as petitioner was here, officers may search that vehicle incident to the arrest.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did not reach the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s alternative holding that Nichols could have conducted a lawful inventory search.  325 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 196.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that if we reject his proposed \xe2\x80\x9ccontact initiation\xe2\x80\x9d rule, we should limit the scope of <em>Belton</em> to \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupants\xe2\x80\x9d who are within \xe2\x80\x9creaching distance\xe2\x80\x9d of the car.

As Justice Scalia forcefully argues, <em>post</em>, p.\xc2\xa02-5 (opinion concurring in judgment), lower court decisions seem now to treat the ability to search a vehicle incident to the arrest of a recent occupant as a police entitlement rather than as an exception justified by the twin rationales of <em>Chimel</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/752/index.html">395 U.

In <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/index.html">453 U.

Rather, he was handcuffed and secured in the back of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s squad car.  The risk that he would nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9cgrab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m]\xe2\x80\x9d from his car was remote in the extreme.

None ultimately persuades me.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first is that, despite being handcuffed and secured in the back of a squad car, petitioner might have escaped and retrieved a weapon or evidence from his vehicle\xe2\x80\x94a theory that calls to mind Judge Goldberg\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the mythical arrestee \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed of the skill of Houdini and the strength of Hercules.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frick</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa02d 666, 673 (CA5 1973) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The United States, endeavoring to ground this seemingly speculative fear in reality, points to a total of seven instances over the past 13 years in which state or federal officers were attacked with weapons by handcuffed or formerly handcuffed arrestees.  Brief for United States 38\xe2\x80\x9339, and n. 12.  These instances do not, however, justify the search authority claimed.  Three involved arrestees who retrieved weapons concealed <em>on their own person</em>.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders</em>, 994 F.\xc2\xa02d 200, 210, n. 60 (CA5 1993) (two instances); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports: Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted 49 (2001).  Three more involved arrestees who seized a weapon <em>from the arresting officer</em>.  See <em>Sanders</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 210, n. 60 (two instances); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports: Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted 49 (1998).  Authority to search the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s own person is beyond question; and of course no search could prevent seizure of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s gun.  Only one of the seven instances involved a handcuffed arrestee who escaped from a squad car to retrieve a weapon from somewhere else: In <em>Plakas</em> v. <em>Drinski</em>, 19 F.\xc2\xa03d 1143, 1144\xe2\x80\x931146 (CA7 1994), the suspect jumped out of the squad car and ran through a forest to a house, where (still in handcuffs) he struck an officer on the wrist with a fireplace poker before ultimately being shot dead.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the Government need not document specific instances in order to justify measures that avoid obvious risks.  But the risk here is far from obvious, and in a context as frequently recurring as roadside arrests, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to come up with even a single example of a handcuffed arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s retrieval of arms or evidence from his vehicle undermines its claims.  The risk that a suspect handcuffed in the back of a squad car might escape and recover a weapon from his vehicle is surely no greater than the risk that a suspect handcuffed in his residence might escape and recover a weapon from the next room\xe2\x80\x94a danger we held insufficient to justify a search in <em>Chimel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 763.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second defense of the search in this case is that, since the officer could have conducted the search at the time of arrest (when the suspect was still near the car), he should not be penalized for having taken the sensible precaution of securing the suspect in the squad car first.  As one Court of Appeals put it: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]t does not make sense to prescribe a constitutional test that is entirely at odds with safe and sensible police procedures.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell</em>, 82 F.\xc2\xa03d 146, 152 (CA7 1996) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karlin</em>, 852 F.\xc2\xa02d 968, 971 (CA7 1988)); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wesley</em>, 293 F.\xc2\xa03d 541, 548\xe2\x80\x93549 (CADC 2002).  The weakness of this argument is that it assumes that, one way or another, the search must take place.  But conducting a <em>Chimel</em> search is not the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right; it is an exception\xe2\x80\x94justified by necessity\xe2\x80\x94to a rule that would otherwise render the search unlawful.  If \xe2\x80\x9csensible police procedures\xe2\x80\x9d require that suspects be handcuffed and put in squad cars, then police should handcuff suspects, put them in squad cars, and not conduct the search.  Indeed, if an officer leaves a suspect unrestrained nearby just to manufacture authority to search, one could argue that the search is unreasonable <em>precisely because</em> the dangerous conditions justifying it existed only by virtue of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to follow sensible procedures. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third defense of the search is that, even though the arrestee posed no risk here, <em>Belton</em> searches in general are reasonable, and the benefits of a bright-line rule justify upholding that small minority of searches that, on their particular facts, are not reasonable.  The validity of this argument rests on the accuracy of <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the passenger compartment is \xe2\x80\x9cin fact generally, even if not inevitably,\xe2\x80\x9d within the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control.  453 U. S., at 460.  By the United States\xe2\x80\x99 own admission, however, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he practice of restraining an arrestee on the scene before searching a car that he just occupied is so prevalent that holding that <em>Belton </em>does not apply in that setting would \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98largely render <em>Belton</em> a dead letter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (quoting <em>Wesley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 548).  Reported cases involving this precise factual scenario\xe2\x80\x94a motorist handcuffed and secured in the back of a squad car when the search takes place\xe2\x80\x94are legion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doward</em>, 41 F.\xc2\xa03d 789, 791 (CA1 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>White</em>, 871 F.\xc2\xa02d 41, 44 (CA6 1989); <em>Mitchell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 152; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Snook</em>, 88 F.\xc2\xa03d 605, 606 (CA8 1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLaughlin</em>, 170 F.\xc2\xa03d 889, 890 (CA9 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Humphrey</em>, 208 F.\xc2\xa03d 1190, 1202 (CA10 2000); <em>Wesley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 544; see also 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa77.1(c), pp. 448\xe2\x80\x93449, n. 79 (3d ed. 1996 and Supp. 2004) (citing cases).  Some courts uphold such searches even when the squad car carrying the handcuffed arrestee has already left the scene.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McLaughlin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 890\xe2\x80\x93891 (upholding search because only five minutes had elapsed since squad car left).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The popularity of the practice is not hard to fathom.  If <em>Belton entitles</em> an officer to search a vehicle upon arresting the driver despite having taken measures that eliminate any danger, what rational officer would not take those measures?  Cf. Moskovitz, A Rule in Search of a Reason: An Empirical Reexamination of <em>Chimel </em>and <em>Belton</em>, 2002 Wis. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 657, 665\xe2\x80\x93666 (citing police training materials).  If it was ever true that the passenger compartment is \xe2\x80\x9cin fact generally, even if not inevitably,\xe2\x80\x9d within the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s immediate control at the time of the search, 453 U. S., at 460, it certainly is not true today.  As one judge has put it: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n our search for clarity, we have now abandoned our constitutional moorings and floated to a place where the law approves of purely exploratory searches of vehicles during which officers with no definite objective or reason for the search are allowed to rummage around in a car to see what they might find.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McLaughlin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 894 (Trott, J., concurring).  I agree entirely with that assessment.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If <em>Belton </em>searches are justifiable, it is not because the arrestee might grab a weapon or evidentiary item from his car, but simply because the car might contain evidence relevant to the crime for which he was arrested.  This more general sort of evidence-gathering search is not without antecedent.  For example, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rabinowitz,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/56/index.html">339 U. S. 56</a> (1950), we upheld a search of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s place of business after he was arrested there.  We did not restrict the officers\xe2\x80\x99 search authority to \xe2\x80\x9cthe area into which [the] arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chimel</em>, 395 U. S., at 763, and we did not justify the search as a means to prevent concealment or destruction of evidence.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Rather, we relied on a more general interest in gathering evidence relevant to the crime for which the suspect had been arrested.  See 339 U. S., at 60\xe2\x80\x9364; see also <em>Harris</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/331/145/index.html">331 U.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson</em>, 163 F. 338, 340, 343 (CC SDNY 1908); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jerome</em>, 47 Misc. 22, 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 93 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 202, 202\xe2\x80\x93203 (1905); <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>State</em>, 117 Wis. 338, 346\xe2\x80\x93347, 93 N.\xc2\xa0W. 1107, 1110 (1903); <em>Ex parte Hurn</em>, 92 Ala. 102, 112, 9 So. 515, 519\xe2\x80\x93520 (1891); <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Weeks</em>, 79 Me. 547, 548\xe2\x80\x93549, 11 A. 599, 599\xe2\x80\x93600 (1887); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa797, pp. 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (J. Kerr 10th ed. 1918); 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa7211, p. 127 (2d ed. 1872); cf. <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Preston</em>, 21 Vt. 9, 15 (1848) (seizure authority); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Frost</em>, 9 Car. &amp; P. 129, 131\xe2\x80\x93134 (1839) (same); <em>King </em>v. <em>Kinsey</em>, 7 Car. &amp; P. 447 (1836) (same); <em>King </em>v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell</em>, 7 Car. &amp; P.\xc2\xa0138 (1835) (same); <em>King </em>v. <em>Barnett</em>, 3 Car. &amp; P. 600, 601 (1829) (same).  Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s 1872 articulation is typical:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe officer who arrests a man on a criminal charge should consider the nature of the charge; and, if he finds about the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s person, or otherwise in his possession, either goods or moneys which there is reason to believe are connected with the supposed crime as its fruits, or as the instruments with which it was committed, or as directly furnishing evidence relating to the transaction, he may take the same, and hold them to be disposed of as the court may direct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bishop, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7211, at 127.</p>\n<p align="left">\nOnly in the years leading up to <em>Chimel </em>did we start consistently referring to the narrower interest in frustrating concealment or destruction of evidence.  See <em>Sibron</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/40/index.html">392 U. S. 40</a>, 67 (1968); <em>Preston</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/364/index.html">376 U. S. 364</a>, 367 (1964).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is nothing irrational about broader police authority to search for evidence when and where the perpetrator of a crime is lawfully arrested.  The fact of prior lawful arrest distinguishes the arrestee from society at large, and distinguishes a search for evidence of <em>his </em>crime from general rummaging.  Moreover, it is not illogical to assume that evidence of a crime is most likely to be found where the suspect was apprehended.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, <em>Chimel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s narrower focus on concealment or destruction of evidence also has historical support.  See <em>Holker </em>v. <em>Hennessey</em>, 141 Mo. 527, 539\xe2\x80\x93540, 42 S.\xc2\xa0W. 1090, 1093 (1897); <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, 16 Cox C.\xc2\xa0C. 245, 250 (Ex. Div. Ire. 1887); <em>Reifsnyder </em>v. <em>Lee</em>, 44 Iowa 101, 103 (1876); S. Welch, Essay on the Office of Constable 17 (1758).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And some of the authorities supporting the broader rule address only searches of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>person</em>, as to which <em>Chimel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limitation might fairly be implicit.  Moreover, carried to its logical end, the broader rule is hard to reconcile with the influential case of <em>Entick </em>v. <em>Carrington</em>, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 1031, 1063\xe2\x80\x931074 (C.\xc2\xa0P. 1765) (disapproving search of plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s private papers under general warrant, despite arrest).  But cf. <em>Dillon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 250\xe2\x80\x93251 (distinguishing <em>Entick</em>); <em>Warden, Md. Penitentiary</em> v. <em>Hayden,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/294/index.html">387 U. S. 294</a>, 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (1967).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, both <em>Rabinowitz</em> and <em>Chimel </em>are plausible accounts of what the Constitution requires, and neither is so persuasive as to justify departing from settled law.  But if we are going to continue to allow <em>Belton</em> searches on <em>stare decisis </em>grounds, we should at least be honest about why we are doing so.  <em>Belton</em> cannot reasonably be explained as a mere application of <em>Chimel</em>.  Rather, it is a return to the broader sort of search incident to arrest that we allowed before <em>Chimel</em>\xe2\x80\x94limited, of course, to searches of motor vehicles, a category of \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d which give rise to a reduced expectation of privacy, see <em>Wyoming</em> v. <em>Houghton, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/295/index.html">526 U. S. 295</a>, 303 (1999), and heightened law enforcement needs, see <em>id.</em>, at 304; <em>Rabinowitz</em>, 339 U. S., at 73 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recasting <em>Belton</em> in these terms would have at least one important practical consequence.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Robinson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/218/index.html">414 U. S. 218</a>, 235 (1973), we held that authority to search an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s person does not depend on the actual presence of one of <em>Chimel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two rationales in the particular case; rather, the fact of arrest alone justifies the search.  That holding stands in contrast to <em>Rabinowitz</em>, where we did not treat the fact of arrest alone as sufficient, but upheld the search only after noting that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot general or exploratory for whatever might be turned up\xe2\x80\x9d but reflected a reasonable belief that evidence would be found.  339 U. S., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363; see also <em>Smith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 24, 93 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S., at 203 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis right and duty of search and seizure extend, however, only to articles which furnish evidence against the accused\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Barnett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 601 (seizure authority limited to relevant evidence); Bishop, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7211, at 127 (officer should \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the nature of the charge\xe2\x80\x9d before searching).  The two different rules make sense: When officer safety or imminent evidence concealment or destruction is at issue, officers should not have to make fine judgments in the heat of the moment.  But in the context of a general evidence-gathering search, the state interests that might justify any overbreadth are far less compelling.  A motorist may be arrested for a wide variety of offenses; in many cases, there is no reasonable basis to believe relevant evidence might be found in the car.

S. 454</a> (1981), there was a widespread conflict among both federal and state courts over the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, in the course of a search incident to the lawful custodial arrest of the occupants of an automobile, police may search inside the automobile after the arrestees are no longer in it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 459.  In answering that question, the Court expanded the authority of the police in two important respects.  It allowed the police to conduct a broader search than our decision in <em>Chimel</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/752/index.html">395 U. S. 752</a>, 762\xe2\x80\x93763 (1969), would have permitted,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and it authorized them to open closed containers that might be found in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s basic rationale for both expansions rested not on a concern for officer safety, but rather on an overriding desire to hew \xe2\x80\x9cto a straightforward rule, easily applied, and predictably enforced.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 U. S., at 459.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  When the case was decided, I was persuaded that the important interest in clarity and certainty adequately justified the modest extension of the <em>Chimel</em> rule to permit an officer to examine the interior of a car pursuant to an arrest for a traffic violation.  But I took a different view with respect to the search of containers within the car absent probable cause, because I thought \xe2\x80\x9cit palpably unreasonable to require the driver of a car to open his briefcase or his luggage for inspection by the officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robbins</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/420/index.html">453 U. S. 420</a>, 451\xe2\x80\x93452 (1981) (dissenting opinion).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  I remain convinced that this aspect of the <em>Belton</em> opinion was both unnecessary and erroneous.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with that view, however, the interest in certainty that supports <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s bright-line rule surely does not justify an expansion of the rule that only blurs those clear lines.  Neither the rule in <em>Chimel</em> nor <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s modification of that rule would have allowed the search of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s car.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A fair reading of the <em>Belton</em> opinion itself, and of the conflicting cases that gave rise to our grant of certiorari, makes clear that we were not concerned with the situation presented in this case.  The Court in <em>Belton</em> noted that the lower courts had discovered <em>Chimel</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reaching-distance principle difficult to apply in the context of automobile searches incident to arrest, and that \xe2\x80\x9cno straightforward rule ha[d] emerged from the litigated cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 U. S., at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  None of the cases cited by the Court to demonstrate the disarray in the lower courts involved a pedestrian who was in the vicinity, but outside the reaching distance, of his or her car.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Nor did any of the decisions cited in the petition for a writ of certiorari[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] present such a case.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Thus, <em>Belton</em> was demonstrably concerned only with the narrow but common circumstance of a search occasioned by the arrest of a suspect who was seated in or driving an automobile at the time the law enforcement official approached.  Normally, after such an arrest has occurred, the officer\xe2\x80\x99s safety is no longer in jeopardy, but he must decide what, if any, search for incriminating evidence he should conduct.  <em>Belton</em> provided previously unavailable and therefore necessary guidance for that category of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The bright-line rule crafted in <em>Belton </em>is not needed for cases in which the arrestee is first accosted when he is a pedestrian, because <em>Chimel</em> itself provides all the guidance that is necessary.  The only genuine justification for extending <em>Belton</em> to cover such circumstances is the interest in uncovering potentially valuable evidence.  In my opinion, that goal must give way to the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally protected interest in privacy when there is already in place a well-defined rule limiting the permissible scope of a search of an arrested pedestrian.  The <em>Chimel </em>rule should provide the same protection to a \xe2\x80\x9crecent occupant\xe2\x80\x9d of a vehicle as to a recent occupant of a house.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unwilling to confine the <em>Belton</em> rule to the narrow class of cases it was designed to address, the Court extends <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reach without supplying any guidance for the future application of its swollen rule.  We are told that officers may search a vehicle incident to arrest \xe2\x80\x9c[s]o long as [the] arrestee is the sort of \xe2\x80\x98recent occupant\xe2\x80\x99 of a vehicle such as petitioner was here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  But we are not told how recent is recent, or how close is close, perhaps because in this case \xe2\x80\x9cthe record is not clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  325 F.\xc2\xa03d 189, 196 (CA4 2003).  As the Court cautioned in <em>Belton</em> itself, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a person cannot know how a court will apply a settled principle to a recurring factual situation, that person cannot know the scope of his constitutional protection, nor can a policeman know the scope of his authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 U. S., at 459\xe2\x80\x93460.  Without some limiting principle, I fear that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will contribute to \xe2\x80\x9ca massive broadening of the automobile exception,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Robbins</em>, 453 U. S., at 452 (Stevens, J., dissenting), when officers have probable cause to arrest an individual but not to search his car.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court gleaned from the case law \xe2\x80\x9cthe generalization that articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within \xe2\x80\x98the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Belton</em>, 453 U. S., at 460 (quoting <em>Chimel</em>, 395 U. S., at 763).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to establish the workable rule this category of cases require[d],\xe2\x80\x9d the Court then read \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Chimel\xe2\x80\x99</em>s definition of the limits of the area that may be searched in light of that generalization.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, <em>Belton</em> held \xe2\x80\x9cthat when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d  453 U. S., at 460 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because police lawfully may search the passenger compartment of the automobile, the Court reasoned, it followed \xe2\x80\x9cthat the police may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within his reach\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Such a container may, of course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 460\xe2\x80\x93461 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court extolled the virtues of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] single, familiar standard \xe2\x80\xa6 to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 458 (quoting <em>Dunaway</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/index.html">442 U.

Because the officer in <em>Robbins</em> had probable cause to believe the car contained marijuana, I would have applied the automobile exception to sustain the search.  <em>Id</em>., at 452 (dissenting opinion).  But I expressed concern that authorizing police officers to search containers in the passenger compartment without probable cause would \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the constitutional predicate for broader vehicle searches than any neutral magistrate could authorize by issuing a warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, 631 F.\xc2\xa02d 1336, 1337 (CA8 1980) (defendant arrested \xe2\x80\x9cwhile sitting in a car\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sanders</em>, 631 F.\xc2\xa02d 1309, 1311-1312 (CA8 1980) (occupants in car at time officers approached); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rigales</em>, 630 F.\xc2\xa02d 364, 365 (CA5 1980) (defendant apprehended during traffic stop); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 919, 922 (CA9 1977) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he agents placed appellant under arrest while he was still in his car\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Frick</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa02d 666, 668, 669 (CA5 1973) (defendant arrested \xe2\x80\x9cat his car in the parking lot adjacent to his apartment building\xe2\x80\x9d; at time of arrest, attach\xc3\xa9 case in question was lying on back seat of car \xe2\x80\x9capproximately two feet from the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creadily accessible\xe2\x80\x9d to him); <em>Hinkel</em> v. <em>Anchorage</em>, 618 P.\xc2\xa02d 1069 (Alaska 1980) (defendant arrested while in car immediately following collision); <em>Ulesky</em> v. <em>State</em>, 379 So.\xc2\xa02d 121, 123 (Fla.
