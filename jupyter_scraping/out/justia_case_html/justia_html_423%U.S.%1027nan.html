In this respect, he is in disagreement with the Court\'s actions in this case today. He joins the Court in granting the petition for writ of certiorari and in ordering plenary consideration of this case, which as he understands it raises issues broader than the power of the State to enjoin the publication of facts disclosed at a public hearing in a State court. Being convinced that these questions should be decided only after adequate briefing and argument and ample time for mature consideration, he is in agreement that we should not attempt to hear and decide this case prior to the beginning of the criminal trial in early January. <b></b></p><p><b> 4. </b>Petitioners Nebraska Press Association et al., are invited to file an amended petition for certiorari on or before December 30, 1975.
