JUSTICE WHITE.</p>\n<p>The Penn-Central Transportation Co. is in bankruptcy reorganization under \xc2\xa7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 417 U. S. 468</a></p><p> U.S. C \xc2\xa7 205.  Petitioners are its trustees authorized to collect its assets, one of which is a claim for freight charges against respondent owed the bankrupt debtor.  The claim on which this suit was brought was $8,256.61, and the amount is undisputed.  Respondent filed a counterclaim for $19,319.42 for loss and damage to shipments over the debtor\'s lines.  Its amount is also not disputed.</p>\n<p>The trustees filed a motion for summary judgment, asking the District Court to enter one judgment covering the amount of freight charges admittedly due and another for the amount claimed by respondent.</p>\n<p>Previously, the Reorganization Court in the Third Circuit had prohibited the various bank creditors from offsetting their claims against the trustees of the debtor.  315 F.Supp. 1281.  Prior to the decision of the instant case, that bank setoff case was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 453 F.2d 520.  Also prior to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in the instant case the Reorganization Court prohibited some shippers from setting off freight loss and damage claims against amounts owed for transportation claims.  That order, 339 F.Supp. 603, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 477 F.2d 841, and by this Court, <em>sub nom. United States Steel Corp. v. Trustees of Penn Central Transp. Co.,</em> 414 U.S. 885.</p>\n<p>The District Court in the instant case granted the trustees\' motion for summary judgment, but set off one judgment against the other, which resulted in a net judgment in favor of respondent against the trustees in the amount of $11,017.01.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 484 F.2d 950, and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p>We reverse.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, where a court has primary jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter, the power to resolve the amount of the claim and the counterclaim is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 417 U. S. 469</a></p><p> clear.  Indeed, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the counterclaim may be compulsory.  Rule 13(a). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  That is the procedure under \xc2\xa7 68 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 108. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 417 U. S. 470</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The problem of the bankruptcy Reorganization Court is somewhat different.  Liquidation is not the objective.  Rather, the aim is by financial restructuring to put back into operation a going concern. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  That entails two basic considerations: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 417 U. S. 471</a></p><p></p>\n<p>First is the collection of amounts owed the bankrupt to keep its cash inflow sufficient for operating purposes, at least at the survival levels.  The second is to design a plan [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which creditors [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and other claimants will approve, which will pass scrutiny of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which will meet the fair and equitable standards required by the Act for court approval, and which will preserve an ongoing railroad in the public interest. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 77a gives the Reorganization Court "exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 205(a).  In furtherance of its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 417 U. S. 472</a></p><p> long-range responsibilities the Reorganization Court enjoined secured creditors from selling collateral to reduce their claims. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It then went on to bar enforcement of liens against the debtor, taking possession of its property, or obtaining judgments against the debtor, except for specified purposes. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  One court seized upon the last provision in the order which says</p>\n<p>"that suits or claims for damages caused by the operation of trains, buses, or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 417 U. S. 473</a></p><p> other means of transportation may be filed and prosecuted to judgment in any Court of competent jurisdiction,"</p>\n<p>to adjudicate the merits of a counterclaim, but declined to allow the setoff. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  But proof of the claim against the debtor is a distinct preliminary stage to a determination of what priority, if any, the claim that is proved receives in a reorganization plan.</p>\n<p>There is a hierarchy of claims, the owner of the equity coming last.  Wages owing workers running the trains have a high current priority.  Secured creditors have, by law, a priority in the hierarchy.  Unsecured creditors usually are pooled together.  They may receive new securities, perhaps stock.  Allowance of a setoff that reduces all or part of the debtor\'s claim against them is a form of priority.  The guiding principle governing priorities is stated in \xc2\xa7 77e(1), 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 205(e)(1):  the Reorganization Court shall approve a plan if it</p>\n<p>"is fair and equitable, affords due recognition to the rights of each class of creditors and stockholders, does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, and will conform to the requirements of the law of the land regarding the participation of the various classes of creditors and stockholders."</p>\n<p>The term "fair and equitable" has a long history going back at least to <em>Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/482/case.html">228 U. S. 482</a></span>, and <em>Kansas City Terminal R. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/271/445/case.html">271 U. S. 445</a></span>, whose fixed principle has been carried over into \xc2\xa7 77e by our decisions. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The plan </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 417 U. S. 474</a></p><p> is, by the terms of \xc2\xa7 77, a product of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Reorganization Court working cooperatively together, <em>New Haven Inclusion Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/392/case.html">399 U. S. 392</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/392/case.html#431">399 U. S. 431</a></span>.  The public interest, as well as the interests of creditors and stockholders, is at issue. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  <em>RFC v. Denver &amp; R. G. W. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/495/case.html">328 U. S. 495</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/495/case.html#535">328 U. S. 535</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The allowance or disallowance of setoff may seem but a minor part of the architectural problem.  But to the extent that it is allowed, it grants a preference to the claim of one creditor over the others by the happenstance that it owes freight charges that the others do not.  That is a form of discrimination to which the policy of \xc2\xa7 77 is opposed.  As a general rule of administration for \xc2\xa7 77 Reorganization Courts, the setoff should not be allowed. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Rule 13(a), the compulsory counterclaim rule, requires a defendant to plead any counterclaim which</p>\n<p>"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\'s claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>The claim is not compulsory if it was the subject of another pending action at the time the action was commenced, or if the opposing party brought his suit by attachment or other process not resulting in personal jurisdiction but only <em>in rem</em> or <em>quasi in rem</em> jurisdiction.  A counterclaim which is compulsory but is not brought is thereafter barred, <em>e.g., Mesker Bros. Iron Co. v. Donata Corp.,</em> 401 F.2d 275, 279.</p>\n<p>If a counterclaim is compulsory, the federal court will have ancillary jurisdiction over it even though ordinarily it would be a matter for a state court, <em>e.g., Great Lakes Rubber Corp. v. Herbert Cooper Co.,</em> 286 F.2d 631.  Under Rule 13(a)\'s predecessor, this Court held that "transaction" is a word of flexible meaning which may comprehend a series of occurrences if they have logical connection, <em>Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/593/case.html">270 U. S. 593</a></span>, and this is the rule generally followed by the lower courts in construing Rule 13(a), <em>e.g., Great Lakes, supra; United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions,</em> 221 F.2d 213, 216.</p>\n<p>Rule 13(b) permits as counterclaims, although not compulsory,</p>\n<p>"any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\'s claim."</p>\n<p>Thus, the court may dispose of all claims between the parties in one proceeding whether or not they arose in the "same transaction."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Title 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 108 provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid."</p>\n<p>"(b) A set-off or counterclaim shall not be allowed in favor of any debtor of the bankrupt which (1) is not provable against the estate and allowable under subdivision (g) of section 93 of this title; or (2) was purchased by or transferred to him after the filing of the petition or within four months before such filing with a view to such use and with knowledge or notice that such bankrupt was insolvent or had committed an act of bankruptcy."</p>\n<p>If the trustee in ordinary bankruptcy goes into a court that has jurisdiction and asserts a claim, the debtor of the bankrupt may raise as a setoff any claim he has against the bankrupt and the court ordinarily issues only one judgment for the difference.</p>\n<p>In a straight bankruptcy case, <em>Cumberland Glass Co. v. De Witt,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/447/case.html">237 U. S. 447</a></span>, the Court construed \xc2\xa7 68 as "permissive, rather than mandatory," and as to which the bankruptcy court "exercises its discretion . . . upon the general principles of equity."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/237/447/case.html#455">237 U. S. 455</a></span>.  <em>And see Susquehanna Chemical Corp. v. Producers Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</em> 174 F.2d 783.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent places mistaken reliance on subsection <em>l</em> of \xc2\xa7 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 205(<em>l</em>), to argue that the setoff provision of \xc2\xa7 68, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 108, necessarily applies to all reorganization proceedings under \xc2\xa7 77.  No authority is cited for this novel construction of subsection <em>l,</em> and indeed the very wording of the subsection itself makes clear that it applies only when "consistent with the provisions" of \xc2\xa7 77.  We have long held that the distinctive purposes of \xc2\xa7 77 may require different procedures than would be followed in ordinary bankruptcy.  For example, in holding that, under \xc2\xa7 77, the Reorganization Court had authority to enjoin the sale of collateral if it would hinder or obstruct the preparation of a reorganization plan, we stated:</p>\n<p>"It may be that, in an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding, the issue of an injunction in the circumstances here presented would not be sustained.  As to that it is not necessary to express an opinion.  But a proceeding under \xc2\xa7 77 is not an ordinary proceeding in bankruptcy.  It is a special proceeding which seeks only to bring about a reorganization if a satisfactory plan to that end can be devised.  And to prevent the attainment of that object is to defeat the very end the accomplishment of which was the sole aim of the section, and thereby to render its provisions futile."</p>\n<p><em>Continental Bank v.

The Court there refused to answer the certified question because it did not know the factual setting in which the question had been raised.  Much law has been fashioned in the reorganization field since 1936, the date of that decision.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In <em>Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/160/case.html">298 U.

The rule to be accepted for the purpose of such a suit is that enforced by courts of equity, which differs from the rule in bankruptcy chiefly in its greater flexibility, the rule in bankruptcy being framed in adaptation to standardized conditions, and that, in equity varying with the needs of the occasion, though remaining constant, like the statute, in the absence of deflecting forces."  <em>Id.</em> at 164-165.

S. 476</a></p><p></p>\n<p>By announcing a doctrine barring judicial setoffs as a "general rule" the Court in the present case adopts a rationale inconsistent with <em>Lowden,</em> which quite clearly envisioned a case-by-case analysis of the propriety of each attempted setoff in the light of equitable considerations.  Rather than replacing this principle with a new and wholly inconsistent rule to be applied in all cases involving judicial setoffs, I would rest this decision on the particular facts before us, which adequately distinguish this case from the situation in <em>Lowden.</em> [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 77a gives the Reorganization Court "<em>exclusive jurisdiction</em> of the debtor and <em>its property wherever located.</em>"  (Emphasis added.)  It has been commonly accepted in the federal courts that "property" within the meaning of this section includes intangibles such as choses in action.  <em>See</em> 2 W. Collier, Bankruptcy 1123.05[4], p. 485 (1971), and cases there cited.  It follows, therefore, that respondent\'s debt to the Penn Central fell within the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the Reorganization Court immediately upon the approval of the petition for reorganization.  While such jurisdiction may not empower the Reorganization Court to enforce the cause of action, <em>see id.</em> at 489-490; <em>In re Roman,</em> 23 F.2d 556 (CA2 1928) (L. Hand, J.), it certainly does empower the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 417 U. S. 477</a></p><p> court to protect the "property" and to immunize it from diminution through setoff or counterclaim.  To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the function of the Reorganization Court to consolidate and protect the assets of the petitioning corporation.  <em>Callaway v.

While the dissent\'s ingenious reading of the statute would provide an easy semantic solution to the problem presented in this case, I am impressed with the fact that neither this Court in <em>Lowden v.

In the absence of any showing based on legislative history that such was the intent of Congress, and particularly in the absence of any briefing or oral argument on the matter, I would not, therefore, give this less than pellucid provision the force ascribed to it by the dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>These statements of the Court concerning allowance of judicial setoffs in \xc2\xa7 77 cases were, in a technical sense, dicta.

The statute most closely in point is \xc2\xa7 68a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 108, which provides:</p>\n<p>"(a) In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid."</p>\n<p>In the only case of this Court dealing with the applicability of \xc2\xa7 68a to railroad reorganizations, the Court said:</p>\n<p>"[T]he trustees must have the power to gather in the assets and keep the business going.  To exercise that power, they may find it necessary to sue, and the suit may turn upon the right of set-off, as it does in the case at hand.

Any lingering doubt that the term "voluntary petition for adjudication" in subsection <em>l</em> refers to ordinary bankruptcy proceedings is dispelled by an examination of \xc2\xa7 73, which was the first section of that Act:</p>\n<p>"Sec. 73.  Additional Jurisdiction. -- In addition to the jurisdiction exercised in voluntary and involuntary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 417 U. S. 480</a></p><p> proceedings to adjudge persons bankrupt, courts of bankruptcy shall exercise original jurisdiction in proceedings for the relief of debtors, as provided in sections 74, 75, and 77 of this Act."</p>\n<p>47 Stat. 1467.  The language of subsection <em>l</em> of \xc2\xa7 77, even more emphatically than the <em>Lowden</em> decision, would seem to unconditionally mandate the application of the rule regarding setoffs contained in \xc2\xa7 68 of the Bankruptcy Act to railroad reorganizations such as this.</p>\n<p>Subsection a of \xc2\xa7 77, 11 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 205(a), giving the Reorganization Court "exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located," upon which the Court\'s opinion heavily relies, seems to me to have virtually nothing to do with this case.  We are not dealing with property that was actually or constructively in the possession of the trustees at the time of the commencement of the reorganization proceedings, nor are we dealing with a creditor who in any way submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Reorganization Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>This is a simple contract claim for freight charges on the part of the trustees, against which the respondent has sought to set off a concededly valid claim for damage in transit.  While the Reorganization Court undoubtedly had plenary authority over the trustees, and over the "property" of the debtor, it certainly does not have such jurisdiction over whatever funds of respondent might be used to satisfy a judgment against it in favor of the trustees.  The trustees\' "property" in this case is a chose in action, and under no conceivable circumstances could \xc2\xa7 77 authorize the summary determination of the claim in this case.</p>\n<p>"[T]he bankruptcy court does not have summary jurisdiction to <em>enforce</em> a chose in action against the bankrupt\'s obligor, even when the bankrupt\'s rights </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 417 U.

They do not touch upon the case before us, where the trustees have chosen to convert the chose in action, which is concededly the property of the debtor and subject to the jurisdiction of the Reorganization Court, into a money judgment in another forum.</p>\n<p><em>Callaway v. Benton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/336/132/case.html">336 U.

There, an action had been brought in the state courts of Georgia to enjoin the board of directors of a corporation which had leased trackage to the Central of Georgia Railway from consenting to the plan of reorganization which had been proposed on behalf of Central of Georgia, which was a debtor in a \xc2\xa7 77 proceeding.  The bankruptcy court had in turn enjoined this litigation on the ground that it interfered with the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.  This Court reversed that determination, saying:</p>\n<p>"We have held that a court of bankruptcy has exclusive and nondelegable control over the administration of an estate in its possession.  <em>Thompson v.

And it seems a sufficient answer to the Court\'s observation that the allowance of a setoff grants a preference, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/467/case.html#473">417 U. S. 473</a></span>, to say that the Bankruptcy Act\'s strictures against preferences apply with as much force to ordinary bankruptcies as to reorganizations, and yet \xc2\xa7 68 of the Act specifically allows this type of "preference" in an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p>It may be that, upon a proper showing to the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the trustees could have satisfied that court that the allowance of a setoff in this case would be inconsistent with higher priorities of the reorganization.  But no such showing was made by the trustees, and they were content to rely on the <em>ex parte</em> order of the Reorganization Court, which made no pretense of considering matter on a case-by-case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 417 U. S. 483</a></p><p> basis.  The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was, therefore, in my opinion, justified in authorizing the setoff under the doctrine of <em>Lowden,</em> and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was correct in affirming its judgment.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
