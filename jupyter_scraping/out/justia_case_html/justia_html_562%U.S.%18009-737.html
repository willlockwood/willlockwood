S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 seeking a judgment for damages against superintending prison officers.  On two consecutive nights during her incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer.  Although she promptly reported the first assault, she further alleged, respondent Jordan, a case manager in her living unit, did nothing to ward off the second sexual assault, despite Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence.  Ortiz further charged that respondent Bright, a prison investigator, retaliated against Ortiz for her accusations by placing her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets.  The responses of both officers, she said, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from violence while in custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jordan and Bright moved for summary judgment on pleas of \xe2\x80\x9cqualified immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Court, noting factual disputes material to Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s claims and the officers\xe2\x80\x99 qualified immunity defenses, denied the summary judgment motion.  The officers did not appeal that ruling.  The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict against Jordan and Bright.  They sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), both at the close of Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and at the close of their own presentation.  But they did not contest the jury\xe2\x80\x99s liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b), their request for judgment as a matter of law.  Nor did they request a new trial under Rule 59(a).  The District Court entered judgment for Ortiz.  On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the District Court should have granted their motion for summary judgment based on their qualified immunity defense.  The Sixth Circuit agreed and reversed the judgment entered on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, holding that both defendants were sheltered from Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s suit by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A party may not appeal a denial of summary judgment after a district court has conducted a full trial on the merits.  A qualified immunity plea, not upheld at the summary judgment stage, may be pursued at trial, but at that stage, the plea must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.  Ordinarily, orders denying summary judgment are interlocutory and do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions\xe2\x80\x9d subject to appeal under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291.  Because a qualified immunity plea can spare an official not only from liability but from trial, this Court has recognized a limited exception to the categorization of summary judgment denials as nonappealable orders.  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526.  The exception permits an immediate appeal when summary judgment is denied to a defendant who urges that qualified immunity shelters her from suit.  <em>Id</em>., at 527.  Such an immediate appeal is not available, however, when the district court determines that factual issues genuinely in dispute preclude summary adjudication.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/304/index.html">515 U. S. 304</a>, 313.  Here, Jordan and Bright sought no immediate appeal from the denial of their summary judgment motion.  Nor did they avail themselves of Rule 50(b), which permits the entry of judgment, postverdict, for the verdict loser if the court finds the evidence legally insufficient to sustain the verdict.  Absent such a motion, an appellate court is \xe2\x80\x9cpowerless\xe2\x80\x9d to review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial.  <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/394/index.html">546 U. S. 394</a>, 405.  This Court need not address the officers\xe2\x80\x99 argument that a qualified immunity plea raising a \xe2\x80\x9cpurely legal\xe2\x80\x9d issue is preserved for appeal by an unsuccessful summary judgment motion even if the plea is not reiterated in a Rule 50(b) motion.  Cases fitting that bill typically involve disputes about the substance and clarity of pre-existing law.  In this case, however, what was controverted was not the pre-existing law, but the facts that could render Jordan and Bright answerable under \xc2\xa71983, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>whether Jordan was adequately informed, after the first assault, of the assailant\xe2\x80\x99s identity and of Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s fear of a further assault.  Because the dispositive facts were disputed, the officers\xe2\x80\x99 qualified immunity defenses did not present \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98neat abstract issues of law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, 515 U. S., at 317.  To the extent that Jordan and Bright urge Ortiz has not proved her case, they were, by their own account, obliged to raise that sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue by postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b).  They did not do so.  The Sixth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to upset the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision on their liability.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">316 Fed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 by Michelle Ortiz, a former inmate at the Ohio Reformatory for Women.  Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Ortiz filed a complaint in federal court stating key facts on which she based claims for damages against superintending prison officers.  On two consecutive nights during her one-year incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer.  Although she promptly reported the first incident, she further alleged, prison authorities took no measures to protect her against the second assault.  After that assault, Ortiz charged, and in retaliation for accounts she gave of the two episodes, prison officials placed her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets.  The treatment to which she was exposed, Ortiz claimed, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from violence while in custody.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Principal defendants in the suit, Paula Jordan, a case manager at Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s living unit, and Rebecca Bright, a prison investigator, moved for summary judgment on their pleas of \xe2\x80\x9cqualified immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d a defense that shields officials from suit if their conduct \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 818 (1982).  Finding that the qualified immunity defense turned on material facts genuinely in dispute, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a), the District Judge denied summary judgment.  <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Voinovich</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 917, 923\xe2\x80\x93930 (SD Ohio 2002).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case then proceeded to trial, and the jury returned verdicts for Ortiz against both Jordan and Bright.  The two officers appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, targeting, <em>inter alia</em>, the denial of their pretrial motion for summary judgment.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals recognized.  316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (2009).  Nevertheless, the Court continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdenial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Reversing the judgment entered on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, the appeals court held that both defendants were sheltered from Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s suit by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted review, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), to decide a threshold question on which the Circuits are split: May a party, as the Sixth Circuit believed, appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits?[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Our answer is no.  The order retains its interlocutory character as simply a step along the route to final judgment.  See <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a>, 546 (1949).  Once the case proceeds to trial, the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary judgment motion.  A qualified immunity defense, of course, does not vanish when a district court declines to rule on the plea summarily.  The plea remains available to the defending officials at trial; but at that stage, the defense must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When summary judgment is sought on a qualified immunity defense, the court inquires whether the party opposing the motion has raised any triable issue barring summary adjudication.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce trial has been had,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cthe availability of official immunity should be determined by the trial record, not the pleadings nor the summary judgment record.\xe2\x80\x9d  15A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \xc2\xa73914.10, p. 684 (2d ed. 1992 and Supp. 2010).  After trial, if defendants continue to urge qualified immunity, the decisive question, ordinarily, is whether the evidence favoring the party seeking relief is legally sufficient to overcome the defense.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b) (stating conditions on which judgment may be granted as a matter of law).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the Court of Appeals, although purporting to review the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 pretrial summary-judgment motion, 316 Fed. Appx., at 453, several times pointed to evidence presented only at the trial stage of the proceedings, see <em>id</em>., at 453\xe2\x80\x93454.  The appeals court erred, but not fatally, by incorrectly placing its ruling under a summary-judgment headline.  Its judgment was infirm, however, because Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s and Bright\xe2\x80\x99s failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) left the appellate forum with no warrant to reject the appraisal of the evidence by \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge who saw and heard the witnesses and ha[d] the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone</em> v. <em>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/212/index.html">330 U. S. 212</a>, 216 (1947).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Michelle Ortiz, serving a sentence for aggravated assault against her husband,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] maintained that she was sexually assaulted on consecutive days by Corrections Officer Douglas Schultz.  On Friday, November 8, 1996, Ortiz recounted, Schultz walked up behind her in the washroom of her living quarters and grabbed one of her breasts.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Ortiz fended off the assault, but Schultz returned later that day and threatened to \xe2\x80\x9csee [her] tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 36.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next day, Ortiz described the incident to Jordan.  After assuring Ortiz that \xe2\x80\x9cno one has the right to touch you,\xe2\x80\x9d 316 Fed. Appx., at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted), Jordan told Ortiz that Schultz had been reassigned to another correctional facility and was serving his last day at the reformatory.  Ortiz could file a written complaint, Jordan noted.  She suggested, however, that Ortiz not do so, in view of Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s imminent departure.  Jordan advised Ortiz that she \xe2\x80\x9calways ha[d] the right to defend [her]self,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 43, and counseled her to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hang out with [her] friends\xe2\x80\x99 for the rest of the day so that Schultz would not have the chance to be alone with her,\xe2\x80\x9d 316 Fed. Appx., at 451 (alteration in original).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The day of her conversation with Ortiz, Jordan wrote an incident report describing her version of the encounter.  In that account, Jordan stated that Ortiz had refused to name her assailant or provide any other information about the assault.  Jordan did not immediately notify her superiors of the assault Ortiz reported and Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s consequent fears about her safety.  Taking the incident report home in her workbag, Jordan submitted it upon her return to work two days later.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ortiz endeavored to follow Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s advice about staying in the company of friends.  But later in the day, feeling ill, she returned to her room and fell asleep.  Three other inmates were in the room when Ortiz went to sleep.  They were gone when she awoke to find Schultz standing over her, one hand fondling her left breast, the fingers of the other hand inside her underwear penetrating her vagina.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Bright\xe2\x80\x99s investigation began two days after the second assault.  During its course, Bright placed Ortiz in solitary confinement.  Ortiz maintained that Bright isolated her in retaliation for her accusations against Schultz.  Bright, however, testified that she segregated Ortiz because Ortiz continued to discuss the investigation with other inmates, disobeying Bright\xe2\x80\x99s repeated instructions to refrain from speaking about it.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In her \xc2\xa71983 action, Ortiz claimed that Jordan did nothing to ward off Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s second sexual assault, despite Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence.  Bright, Ortiz charged, retaliated against her because she resisted Bright\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to induce her to retract her accounts of Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s assaults.  (Schultz, having resigned from state employment, could not be found and served with process.)  The District Court, noting multiple factual disputes material to Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s claims and the officers\xe2\x80\x99 defense of qualified immunity, denied summary judgment to Jordan and Bright, 211 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 923\xe2\x80\x93930;[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] neither defendant appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of summary judgment.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case proceeded to trial, and a jury returned a verdict of $350,000 in compensatory and punitive damages against Jordan and $275,000 against Bright.  Jordan and Bright sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50(a), both at the close of Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and at the close of their own presentation.  But they did not contest the jury\xe2\x80\x99s liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b), their request for judgment as a matter of law.  Nor did they request a new trial under Rule 59(a).  The District Court entered judgment for Ortiz in accordance with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged both that the District Court should have granted them summary judgment on their defense of qualified immunity and that the ver-dict was \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the weight of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Defendants-Appellants in No. 06\xe2\x80\x933627 (CA6), pp. 21, 26.

Because Ortiz presented no argument about the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion in her brief to the Sixth Circuit or in her petition for certiorari, Jordan and Bright argue, she has forfeited the objection. Jordan and Bright are not well positioned to make this argument.  They did not suggest that Ortiz had forfeited her Rule 50(b) objection, or argue that such an objection is forfeitable, until their merits brief to this Court.

A plea that a verdict is \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the weight of the evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, is not equivalent to a plea that the evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury.  11 C.

I agree with the Court that the answer is no.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The Court also reaches beyond that question, however, to address the effect of Jordan and Bright\xe2\x80\x99s failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b).  I would limit our decision to the question presented and remand for consideration of any additional issues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court concludes, a party ordinarily cannot appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Most such orders are not appealable at all, because they neither qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions\xe2\x80\x9d capable of appeal under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291 nor come within the narrow class of appealable interlocutory orders under \xc2\xa71292(a)(1).  And for those that are appealable,<footcall num="*"> the time for filing an appeal will usually have run by the conclusion of the trial.  See \xc2\xa72107(a) (providing that a notice of appeal in a civil case generally must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin thirty days\xe2\x80\x9d after entry of the relevant judgment or order); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A). </footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is the ordinary case.  Even if the order denying summary judgment qualified under the collateral order doctrine as an appealable \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71291, the time for filing that appeal expired long before trial.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The Court of Appeals therefore lacked jurisdiction to review the order.  I would reverse the judgment on that ground alone and remand for further proceedings.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority proceeds to consider the additional question whether Jordan and Bright\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprived the Court of Appeals of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98powe[r]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to review the sufficiency of the trial evidence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 8 (quoting <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/394/index.html">546 U. S. 394</a>, 405 (2006)).  The Court does so because it concludes that the Court of\nAppeals did not confine itself to the pretrial record and instead reviewed the trial evidence.  <em>Ante,</em> at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not think it necessary to reach beyond the question presented.  It is clear from the opinion that the appeals court reviewed the order denying summary judgment, and that was error.  The Court of Appeals explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d this case \xe2\x80\x9cis an exception to th[at] rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (CA6 2009).  And to support that conclusion, the court cited <em>Goff</em> v.<em> Bise</em>, 173 F.\xc2\xa03d 1068 (1999), in which the Eighth Circuit reviewed an order denying summary judgment.  Finally, the Court of Appeals equated its review in this case to the review of an \xe2\x80\x9cinterlocutory appea[l] of qualified immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d which suggests that the court saw itself as reviewing the interlocutory order denying summary judgment.  316 Fed. Appx., at 453.  Whether, in erroneously reviewing the order denying summary judgment, the Court of Appeals considered the pretrial or full trial record is beside the point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also think it unwise to reach the Rule 50 issue and the questions that follow.  Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief at the merits stage focused on the question presented\xe2\x80\x94whether the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review an order denying summary judgment.  It was not until Jordan and Bright\xe2\x80\x99s response brief in this Court, in which they argued that they had not actually appealed the order denying summary judgment, that the Rule 50 issues were addressed at any length.  This Court normally proceeds\nmore cautiously.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not address these issues at all, and we are ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9ca court of final review and not first view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mineta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/103/index.html">534 U. S. 103</a>, 110 (2001) <em>(per curiam)</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  This seems a good rule to follow in a case like this, which raises difficult and far-reaching questions of civil procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would resolve only the question on which we granted certiorari.  I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U.
