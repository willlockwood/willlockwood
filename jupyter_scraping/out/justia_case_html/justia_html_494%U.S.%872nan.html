Ore.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 475.992(4) (1987).  The law defines "controlled substance" as a drug classified in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 811-812 (1982 ed. and Supp. V), as modified by the State Board of Pharmacy.  Ore.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 475.005(6) (1987).  Persons who violate this provision by possessing a controlled substance listed on Schedule I are "guilty of a Class B felony."  \xc2\xa7 475.992(4)(a).  As compiled by the State Board of Pharmacy under its statutory authority, <em>see</em> Ore.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 475.035 (1987), Schedule I contains the drug peyote, a hallucinogen derived from the plant Lophophorawilliamsii Lemaire.  Ore.Admin.  Rule 855-80-021(3)(s) (1988).</p>\n<p>Respondents Alfred Smith and Galen Black were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American Church, of which both are members.  When respondents applied to petitioner Employment Division for unemployment compensation, they were determined to be ineligible for benefits because they had been discharged for work-related "misconduct".  The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed that determination, holding that the denial of benefits violated respondents\' free exercise rights under the First Amendment. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="875">Page 494 U. S. 875</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court, petitioner argued that the denial of benefits was permissible because respondents\' consumption of peyote was a crime under Oregon law.  The Oregon Supreme Court reasoned, however, that the criminality of respondents\' peyote use was irrelevant to resolution of their constitutional claim -- since the purpose of the "misconduct" provision under which respondents had been disqualified was not to enforce the State\'s criminal laws, but to preserve the financial integrity of the compensation fund, and since that purpose was inadequate to justify the burden that disqualification imposed on respondents\' religious practice.  Citing our decisions in <em>Sherbert v. Verner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html">374 U. S. 398</a></span> (1963), and <em>Thomas v. Review Board, Indiana Employment Security Div.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html">450 U. S. 707</a></span> (1981), the court concluded that respondents were entitled to payment of unemployment benefits.  <em>Smith v. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources,</em> 301 Or. 209, 217-219, 721 P.2d 445, 449-450 (1986).  We granted certiorari.  480 U.S. 916 (1987).</p>\n<p>Before this Court in 1987, petitioner continued to maintain that the illegality of respondents\' peyote consumption was relevant to their constitutional claim.  We agreed, concluding that</p>\n<p>"if a State has prohibited through its criminal laws certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating the First Amendment, it certainly follows that it may impose the lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to persons who engage in that conduct."</p>\n<p><em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html">485 U. S. 660</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#670">485 U. S. 670</a></span> (1988) (<em>Smith I</em>).  We noted, however, that the Oregon Supreme Court had not decided whether respondents\' sacramental use of peyote was in fact proscribed by Oregon\'s controlled substance law, and that this issue was a matter of dispute between the parties.  Being "uncertain about the legality of the religious use of peyote in Oregon," we determined that it would not be "appropriate for us to decide whether the practice is protected by the Federal Constitution."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#673">485 U. S. 673</a></span>.  Accordingly, we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="876">Page 494 U.

S. 674</a></span>.</p>\n<p>On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that respondents\' religiously inspired use of peyote fell within the prohibition of the Oregon statute, which "makes no exception for the sacramental use" of the drug.  307 Or. 68, 72-73, 763 P.2d 146, 148 (1988).  It then considered whether that prohibition was valid under the Free Exercise Clause, and concluded that it was not.  The court therefore reaffirmed its previous ruling that the State could not deny unemployment benefits to respondents for having engaged in that practice.</p>\n<p>We again granted certiorari.  489 U.S. 1077 (1989).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondents\' claim for relief rests on our decisions in <em>Sherbert v.

S. 136</a></span> (1987), in which we held that a State could not condition the availability of unemployment insurance on an individual\'s willingness to forgo conduct required by his religion.  As we observed in <em>Smith I,</em> however, the conduct at issue in those cases was not prohibited by law.  We held that distinction to be critical, for</p>\n<p>"if Oregon does prohibit the religious use of peyote, and if that prohibition is consistent with the Federal Constitution, there is no federal right to engage in that conduct in Oregon,"</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>"the State is free to withhold unemployment compensation from respondents for engaging in work-related misconduct, despite its religious motivation."</p>\n<p>485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#672">485 U. S. 672</a></span>.  Now that the Oregon Supreme Court has confirmed that Oregon does prohibit the religious use of peyote, we proceed to consider whether that prohibition is permissible under the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been made applicable to the States by incorporation into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="877">Page 494 U.

I (emphasis added).  The free exercise of religion means, first and foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires.  Thus, the First Amendment obviously excludes all "governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such."  <em>Sherbert v.

It would be true, we think (though no case of ours has involved the point), that a state would be "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" if it sought to ban such acts or abstentions only when they are engaged in for religious reasons, or only because of the religious belief that they display.  It would doubtless be unconstitutional, for example, to ban the casting of "statues that are to be used </p><p><a class="page-number" name="878">Page 494 U. S. 878</a></p><p> for worship purposes," or to prohibit bowing down before a golden calf.</p>\n<p>Respondents in the present case, however, seek to carry the meaning of "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" one large step further.  They contend that their religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of a criminal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice, and that is concededly constitutional as applied to those who use the drug for other reasons.  They assert, in other words, that "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" includes requiring any individual to observe a generally applicable law that requires (or forbids) the performance of an act that his religious belief forbids (or requires).  As a textual matter, we do not think the words must be given that meaning.  It is no more necessary to regard the collection of a general tax, for example, as "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" by those citizens who believe support of organized government to be sinful than it is to regard the same tax as "abridging the freedom . . . of the press" of those publishing companies that must pay the tax as a condition of staying in business.  It is a permissible reading of the text, in the one case as in the other, to say that, if prohibiting the exercise of religion (or burdening the activity of printing) is not the object of the tax, but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.  <em>Compare Citizen Publishing Co. v.

Applying that test, we have, on three occasions, invalidated state unemployment compensation rules that conditioned the availability of benefits upon an applicant\'s willingness to work under conditions forbidden by his religion.  <em>See Sherbert v.

We have never invalidated any governmental action on the basis of the <em>Sherbert</em> test except the denial of unemployment compensation.

The <em>Sherbert</em> test, it must be recalled, was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.  As a plurality of the Court noted in <em>Roy,</em> a distinctive feature of unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind an applicant\'s unemployment:</p>\n<p>"The statutory conditions [in <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Thomas</em>] provided that a person was not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, \'without good cause,\' he had quit work or refused available work.

As the plurality pointed out in <em>Roy,</em> our decisions in the unemployment cases stand for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of "religious hardship" without compelling reason.  <em>Bowen v.

We conclude today that the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to such challenges.  The government\'s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, "cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector\'s spiritual development."  <em>Lyng, supra,</em> 485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/439/case.html#451">485 U. S. 451</a></span>.  To make an individual\'s obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law\'s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\'s interest is "compelling" -- permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, "to become a law unto himself," <em>Reynolds v. United States,</em> 98 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/98/145/case.html#167">98 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields.  But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, <em>see, e.g.,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="886">Page 494 U.

What it produces in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor is it possible to limit the impact of respondents\' proposal by requiring a "compelling state interest" only when the conduct prohibited is "central" to the individual\'s religion.  <em>Cf.

What principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer\'s assertion that a particular act is "central" to his personal faith?  Judging the centrality of different religious practices is akin to the unacceptable "business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims."  <em>United States v.

Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to the press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster the dissemination of the printed word, so also a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to be solicitous of that value in its legislation as well.  It is therefore not surprising that a number of States have made an exception to their drug laws for sacramental peyote use.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 13-3402(B)(1) (3) (1989); Colo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 12-22-317(3) (1985);  N.M.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 30-31-6(D) (Supp.1989).  But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious practice exemption is permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally required, and that the appropriate occasions for its creation can be discerned by the courts.  It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>Because respondents\' ingestion of peyote was prohibited under Oregon law, and because that prohibition is constitutional, Oregon may, consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment compensation when their dismissal results from use of the drug.

But since Justice Douglas voted with the majority in <em>Sherbert,</em> that quote obviously envisioned that what "the government cannot do to the individual" includes not just the prohibition of an individual\'s freedom of action through criminal laws, but also the running of its programs (in <em>Sherbert,</em> state unemployment compensation) in such fashion as to harm the individual\'s religious interests.  Moreover, it is hard to see any reason in principle or practicality why the government should have to tailor its health and safety laws to conform to the diversity of religious belief, but should not have to tailor its management of public lands, <em>Lyng, supra,</em> or its administration of welfare programs, <em>Roy, supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice O\'CONNOR suggests that "[t]here is nothing talismanic about neutral laws of general applicability," and that all laws burdening religious practices should be subject to compelling interest scrutiny because</p>\n<p>"the First Amendment unequivocally makes freedom of religion, like freedom from race discrimination and freedom of speech, a \'constitutional norm,\' not an \'anomaly.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#901">494 U.

Just as we subject to the most exacting scrutiny laws that make classifications based on race, <em>see Palmore v. Sidoti, supra,</em> or on the content of speech, <em>see Sable Communications, supra,</em> so too we strictly scrutinize governmental classifications based on religion, <em>see McDaniel v.

But we have held that race-neutral laws that have the <em>effect</em> of disproportionately disadvantaging a particular racial group do not thereby become subject to compelling interest analysis under the Equal Protection Clause, <em>see Washington v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/case.html">426 U.

Our conclusion that generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest is the only approach compatible with these precedents.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>While arguing that we should apply the compelling interest test in this case, Justice O\'CONNOR nonetheless agrees that</p>\n<p>"our determination of the constitutionality of Oregon\'s general criminal prohibition cannot, and should not, turn on the centrality of the particular religious practice at issue,"</p>\n<p><em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#906">494 U. S. 906</a></span>-907 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring).  This means, presumably, that compelling interest scrutiny must be applied to generally applicable laws that regulate or prohibit <em>any</em> religiously motivated activity, no matter how unimportant to the claimant\'s religion.  Earlier in her opinion, however, Justice O\'CONNOR appears to contradict this, saying that the proper approach is</p>\n<p>"to determine whether the burden on the specific plaintiffs before us is constitutionally significant and whether the particular criminal interest asserted by the State before us is compelling."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#899">494 U. S. 899</a></span>.  "Constitutionally significant burden" would seem to be "centrality" under another name.  In any case, dispensing with a "centrality" inquiry is utterly unworkable.  It would require, for example, the same degree of "compelling state interest" to impede the practice of throwing rice at church weddings as to impede the practice of getting married in church.  There is no way out of the difficulty that, if general laws are to be subjected to a "religious practice" exception, <em>both</em> the importance of the law at issue <em>and</em> the centrality of the practice at issue must reasonably be considered.</p>\n<p>Nor is this difficulty avoided by Justice BLACKMUN\'s assertion that</p>\n<p>"although courts should refrain from delving into questions of whether, as a matter of religious doctrine, a particular practice is \'central\' to the religion, I do not think this means that the courts must turn a blind eye to the severe impact of a State\'s restrictions on the adherents of a minority religion."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#919">494 U. S. 919</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  As Justice BLACKMUN\'s opinion proceeds to make clear, inquiry into "severe impact" is no different from inquiry into centrality.  He has merely substituted for the question "How important is X to the religious adherent?" the question "How great will be the harm to the religious adherent if X is taken away?"  There is no material difference.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice O\'CONNOR contends that the "parade of horribles" in the text only</p>\n<p>"demonstrates . . . that courts have been quite capable of strik[ing] sensible balances between religious liberty and competing state interests."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#902">494 U.

In any event, Justice O\'CONNOR mistakes the purpose of our parade:  it is not to suggest that courts would necessarily permit harmful exemptions from these laws (though they might), but to suggest that courts would constantly be in the business of determining whether the "severe impact" of various laws on religious practice (to use Justice BLACKMUN\'s terminology) or the "constitutiona[l] significan[ce]" of the "burden on the particular plaintiffs" (to use Justice O\'CONNOR\'s terminology) suffices to permit us to confer an exemption.  It is a parade of horribles because it is horrible to contemplate that federal judges will regularly balance against the importance of general laws the significance of religious practice.</p>\n<p>Justice O\'CONNOR, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN join as to Parts I and II, concurring in the judgment. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Although I agree with the result the Court reaches in this case, I cannot join its opinion.  In my view, today\'s holding dramatically departs from well settled First Amendment jurisprudence, appears unnecessary to resolve the question presented, and is incompatible with our Nation\'s fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>At the outset, I note that I agree with the Court\'s implicit determination that the constitutional question upon which we granted review -- whether the Free Exercise Clause protects a person\'s religiously motivated use of peyote from the reach of a State\'s general criminal law prohibition -- is properly presented in this case.  As the Court recounts, respondents Alfred Smith and Galen Black were denied unemployment compensation benefits because their sacramental use of peyote constituted work-related "misconduct," not because they violated Oregon\'s general criminal prohibition against possession of peyote.  We held, however, in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html">485 U. S. 660</a></span> (1988) (<em>Smith I</em>), that whether a State may, consistent with federal law, deny unemployment compensation benefits to persons for their religious use of peyote depends on whether the State, as a matter of state law, has criminalized the underlying conduct.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#670">485 U. S. 670</a></span>-672.  The Oregon Supreme Court, on remand from this Court, concluded that "the Oregon statute against possession of controlled substances, which include peyote, makes no exception for the sacramental use of peyote."  307 Or. 68, 72-73, 763 P.2d 146, 148 (1988) (footnote omitted). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="892">Page 494 U. S. 892</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents contend that, because the Oregon Supreme Court declined to decide whether the Oregon Constitution prohibits criminal prosecution for the religious use of peyote, <em>see id.</em> at 73, n. 3, 763 P.2d at 148, n. 3, any ruling on the federal constitutional question would be premature.  Respondents are of course correct that the Oregon Supreme Court may eventually decide that the Oregon Constitution requires the State to provide an exemption from its general criminal prohibition for the religious use of peyote.  Such a decision would then reopen the question whether a State may nevertheless deny unemployment compensation benefits to claimants who are discharged for engaging in such conduct.  As the case comes to us today, however, the Oregon Supreme Court has plainly ruled that Oregon\'s prohibition against possession of controlled substances does not contain an exemption for the religious use of peyote.  In light of our decision in <em>Smith I,</em> which makes this finding a "necessary predicate to a correct evaluation of respondents\' federal claim," 485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#672">485 U. S. 672</a></span>, the question presented and addressed is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court today extracts from our long history of free exercise precedents the single categorical rule that</p>\n<p>"if prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is . . . merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#878">494 U.

Indeed, the Court holds that, where the law is a generally applicable criminal prohibition, our usual free exercise jurisprudence does not even apply.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#884">494 U. S. 884</a></span>.  To reach this sweeping result, however, the Court must not only give a strained reading of the First Amendment but must also disregard our consistent application of free exercise doctrine to cases involving generally applicable regulations that burden religious conduct. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="893">Page 494 U. S. 893</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment commands that "Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]."  In <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html">310 U. S. 296</a></span> (1940), we held that this prohibition applies to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment and that it categorically forbids government regulation of religious beliefs.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html#303">310 U.

As the Court recognizes, however, the "free exercise" of religion often, if not invariably, requires the performance of (or abstention from) certain acts.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#877">494 U. S. 877</a></span>; <em>cf.</em> 3 A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 401-402 (J. Murray, ed. 1897) (defining "exercise" to include "[t]he practice and performance of rites and ceremonies, worship, etc.; the right or permission to celebrate the observances (of a religion)" and religious observances such as acts of public and private worship, preaching, and prophesying).  "[B]elief and action cannot be neatly confined in logic-tight compartments."  <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/205/case.html">406 U.

Because the First Amendment does not distinguish between religious belief and religious conduct, conduct motivated by sincere religious belief, like the belief itself, must therefore be at least presumptively protected by the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court today, however, interprets the Clause to permit the government to prohibit, without justification, conduct mandated by an individual\'s religious beliefs, so long as that prohibition is generally applicable.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#878">494 U. S. </a>.</span>  But a law that prohibits certain conduct -- conduct that happens to be an act of worship for someone -- manifestly does prohibit that person\'s free exercise of his religion.  A person who is barred from engaging in religiously motivated conduct is barred from freely exercising his religion.  Moreover, that person is barred from freely exercising his religion regardless of whether the law prohibits the conduct only when engaged in for religious reasons, only by members of that religion, or by all persons.  It is difficult to deny that a law that prohibits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="894">Page 494 U. S. 894</a></p><p> religiously motivated conduct, even if the law is generally applicable, does not at least implicate First Amendment concerns.</p>\n<p>The Court responds that generally applicable laws are "one large step" removed from laws aimed at specific religious practices.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The First Amendment, however, does not distinguish between laws that are generally applicable and laws that target particular religious practices.  Indeed, few States would be so naive as to enact a law directly prohibiting or burdening a religious practice as such.  Our free exercise cases have all concerned generally applicable laws that had the effect of significantly burdening a religious practice.  If the First Amendment is to have any vitality, it ought not be construed to cover only the extreme and hypothetical situation in which a State directly targets a religious practice.  As we have noted in a slightly different context,</p>\n<p>"\'[s]uch a test has no basis in precedent and relegates a serious First Amendment value to the barest level of minimum scrutiny that the Equal Protection Clause already provides.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Hobbie v.

Under our established First Amendment jurisprudence, we have recognized that the freedom to act, unlike the freedom to believe, cannot be absolute.  <em>See, e.g., Cantwell, supra,</em> 310 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html#304">310 U.

Instead, we have respected both the First Amendment\'s express textual mandate and the governmental interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the Government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  <em>See Hernandez v.

But as the Court later notes, as it must, in cases such as <em>Cantwell</em> and <em>Yoder,</em> we have in fact interpreted the Free Exercise Clause to forbid application of a generally applicable prohibition to religiously motivated conduct.  <em>See Cantwell, supra,</em> 310 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/296/case.html#304">310 U.

Indeed, in <em>Yoder</em> we expressly rejected the interpretation the Court now adopts:</p>\n<p>"[O]ur decisions have rejected the idea that religiously grounded conduct is always outside the protection of the Free Exercise Clause.

But to agree that religiously grounded conduct must often be subject to the broad police power of the State is not to deny that there are areas of conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and thus beyond the power of the State to control, <em>even under regulations of general applicability.</em> . . .

S. 882</a></span>, might therefore be regarded as merely harmless dictum.  Rather, respondents invoke our traditional compelling interest test to argue that the Free Exercise Clause requires the State to grant them a limited exemption from its general criminal prohibition against the possession of peyote.  The Court today, however, denies them even the opportunity to make that argument, concluding that "the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the [compelling interest] test inapplicable to" challenges to general criminal prohibitions.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#885">494 U.

As we explained in <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<p>"Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists."</p>\n<p>450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/707/case.html#717">450 U.

A State that makes criminal an individual\'s religiously motivated conduct burdens that individual\'s free exercise of religion in the severest manner possible, for it "results in the choice to the individual of either abandoning his religious principle or facing criminal prosecution."  <em>Braunfeld, supra,</em> 366 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/599/case.html#605">366 U.

Once it has been shown that a government regulation or criminal prohibition burdens the free exercise of religion, we have consistently asked the Government to demonstrate that unbending application of its regulation to the religious objector "is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest," <em>Lee, supra,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/case.html#257">455 U.

To me, the sounder approach -- the approach more consistent with our role as judges to decide each case on its individual merits -- is to apply this test in each case to determine whether the burden on the specific plaintiffs before us is constitutionally significant, and whether the particular criminal interest asserted by the State before us is compelling.  Even if, as an empirical matter, a government\'s criminal laws might usually serve a compelling interest in health, safety, or public order, the First Amendment at least requires a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim. <em>Cf. McDaniel,</em> 435 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/618/case.html#628">435 U. S. 628</a></span>, n. 8 (plurality opinion) (noting application of <em>Sherbert</em> to general criminal prohibitions and the "delicate balancing required by our decisions in" <em>Sherbert</em> and <em>Yoder</em>).  Given the range of conduct that a State might legitimately make </p><p><a class="page-number" name="900">Page 494 U. S. 900</a></p><p> criminal, we cannot assume, merely because a law carries criminal sanctions and is generally applicable, that the First Amendment never requires the State to grant a limited exemption for religiously motivated conduct.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we have not "rejected" or "declined to apply" the compelling interest test in our recent cases.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#883">494 U. S. 883</a></span>-884.  Recent cases have instead affirmed that test as a fundamental part of our First Amendment doctrine.  <em>See, e.g., Hernandez,</em> 490 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/680/case.html#699">490 U.

The cases cited by the Court signal no retreat from our consistent adherence to the compelling interest test.  In both <em>Bowen v. Roy, supra,</em> and <em>Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetary Protective Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/439/case.html">485 U.

The Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens."</p>\n<p><em>Roy, supra,</em> 476 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/693/case.html#699">476 U.

Because the case <em>sub judice,</em> like the other cases in which we have applied <em>Sherbert,</em> plainly falls into the former category, I would apply those established precedents to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the other cases cited by the Court for the proposition that we have rejected application of the <em>Sherbert</em> test outside the unemployment compensation field, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#884">494 U.

S. 901</a></p><p> the government to justify a burden on religious conduct by articulating a compelling interest.  <em>See Goldman v. Weinberger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/503/case.html">475 U. S. 503</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/503/case.html#507">475 U.

That we did not apply the compelling interest test in these cases says nothing about whether the test should continue to apply in paradigm free exercise cases such as the one presented here.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court today gives no convincing reason to depart from settled First Amendment jurisprudence.  There is nothing talismanic about neutral laws of general applicability or general criminal prohibitions, for laws neutral toward religion can coerce a person to violate his religious conscience or intrude upon his religious duties just as effectively as laws aimed at religion.  Although the Court suggests that the compelling interest test, as applied to generally applicable laws, would result in a "constitutional anomaly," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#886">494 U. S. 886</a></span>, the First Amendment unequivocally makes freedom of religion, like freedom from race discrimination and freedom of speech, a "constitutional nor[m]," not an "anomaly."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nor would application of our established free exercise doctrine to this case necessarily be incompatible with our equal protection cases.  <em>Cf. Rogers v. Lodge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html">458 U.

We have, in any event, recognized that the Free Exercise Clause protects values distinct from those protected by the Equal Protection Clause.  <em>See Hobbie,</em> 480 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/136/case.html#141">480 U. S. 141</a></span>-142.  As the language of the </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="902">Page 494 U. S. 902</a></em></p><p><em> Clause itself makes clear, an individual\'s free exercise of religion is a preferred constitutional activity.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> McConnell, Accommodation of Religion, 1985 Sup.Ct.Rev. 1, 9 ("[T]he text of the First Amendment itself `singles out\' religion for special protections"); P. Kauper, Religion and the Constitution 17 (1964).  A law that makes criminal such an activity therefore triggers constitutional concern -- and heightened judicial scrutiny -- even if it does not target the particular religious conduct at issue. Our free speech cases similarly recognize that neutral regulations that affect free speech values are subject to a balancing, rather than categorical, approach.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. O\'Brien,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html">391 U.

S. 890</a></span>.  In my view, however, the First Amendment was enacted precisely to protect the rights of those whose religious practices are not shared by the majority and may be viewed with hostility.  The history of our free exercise doctrine amply demonstrates the harsh impact majoritarian rule has had on unpopular or emerging religious groups such as the Jehovah\'s Witnesses and the Amish.  Indeed, the words of Justice Jackson in <em>West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette</em> (overruling <em>Minersville School District v. Gobitis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/586/case.html">310 U. S. 586</a></span> (1940)) are apt: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="903">Page 494 U.

They fashioned a charter of government which envisaged the widest possible toleration of conflicting views").  The compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment\'s mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.  For the Court to deem this command a "luxury," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#888">494 U.

I would reach the same result applying our established free exercise jurisprudence.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>There is no dispute that Oregon\'s criminal prohibition of peyote places a severe burden on the ability of respondents to freely exercise their religion.  Peyote is a sacrament of the Native American Church, and is regarded as vital to respondents\' ability to practice their religion.  <em>See</em> O. Stewart, Peyote Religion:  A History 327-336 (1987) (describing modern status of peyotism); E. Anderson, Peyote:  The Divine Cactus 41-65 (1980) (describing peyote ceremonies); Teachings from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="904">Page 494 U.

As we noted in <em>Smith I,</em> the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that</p>\n<p>"the Native American Church is a recognized religion, that peyote is a sacrament of that church, and that respondent\'s beliefs were sincerely held."</p>\n<p>485 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/660/case.html#667">485 U.

Indeed, under federal law (incorporated by Oregon law in relevant part, <em>see</em> Ore.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 475.005(6) (1989)), peyote is specifically regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance, which means that Congress has found that it has a high potential for abuse, that there is no currently accepted medical use, and that there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision.  <em>See</em> 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 812(b)(1).  <em>See generally</em> R.

Although the question is close, I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon\'s criminal prohibition is "essential to accomplish," <em>Lee, supra,</em> at 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/252/case.html#257">455 U. S. 257</a></span>, its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance.  Oregon\'s criminal prohibition represents that State\'s judgment that the possession and use of controlled substances, even by only one person, is inherently harmful and dangerous.  Because the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them.  <em>Cf. State v. Massey,</em> 229 N.C. 734, 51 S.E.2d 179 (denying religious exemption to municipal ordinance prohibiting handling of poisonous reptiles), <em>appeal dism\'d sub nom. Bunn v. North Carolina,</em> 336 U.S. 942 (1949).  Moreover, in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon\'s stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote.  <em>Cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/197/11/case.html">197 U.

But other governments may surely choose to grant an exemption without Oregon, with its specific asserted interest in uniform application of its drug laws, being required to do so by the First Amendment.  Respondents also note that the sacramental use of peyote is central to the tenets of the Native American Church, but I agree with the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#886">494 U.

This does not mean, of course, that courts may not make factual findings as to whether a claimant holds a sincerely held religious belief that conflicts with, and thus is burdened by, the challenged law.  The distinction between questions of centrality and questions of sincerity and burden is admittedly fine, but it is one that is an established part of our free exercise doctrine, <em>see Ballard,</em> 322 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/78/case.html#85">322 U.

One hopes that the Court is aware of the consequences, and that its result is not a product of overreaction to the serious problems the country\'s drug crisis has generated.</p>\n<p>This distorted view of our precedents leads the majority to conclude that strict scrutiny of a state law burdening the free exercise of religion is a "luxury" that a well-ordered society </p><p><a class="page-number" name="909">Page 494 U.

Failure to reduce the competing interests to the same plane of generality tends to distort the weighing process in the State\'s favor.  <em>See</em> Clark, Guidelines for the Free Exercise Clause, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 327, 330-331 (1969) ("The purpose of almost any law can be traced back to one or another of the fundamental concerns of government:  public health and safety, public peace and order, defense, revenue.

The State cannot plausibly assert that unbending application of a criminal prohibition is essential to fulfill any compelling interest if it does not, in fact, attempt to enforce that prohibition.  In this case, the State actually has not evinced any concrete interest in enforcing its drug laws against religious users of peyote.  Oregon has never sought to prosecute respondents, and does not claim that it has made significant enforcement efforts against other religious users of peyote. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The State\'s asserted interest thus amounts only to the symbolic preservation of an unenforced prohibition.

Stewart, Peyote Religion 75 <em>et seq.</em> (1987) (noting frequent observations, across many tribes and periods in history, of correlation between peyotist religion and abstinence from alcohol).  Far from promoting the lawless and irresponsible use of drugs, Native American Church members\' spiritual </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="916">Page 494 U. S. 916</a></em></p><p><em> code exemplifies values that Oregon\'s drug laws are presumably intended to foster.\n</em></p>\n<p>The State also seeks to support its refusal to make an exception for religious use of peyote by invoking its interest in abolishing drug trafficking.  There is, however, practically no illegal traffic in peyote.  <em>See Olsen,</em> 279 U.S.App.D.C., at 6, 10, 878 F.2d at 1463, 1467 (quoting DEA Final Order to the effect that total amount of peyote seized and analyzed by federal authorities between 1980 and 1987 was 19.4 pounds; in contrast, total amount of marijuana seized during that period was over 15 million pounds).  Also, the availability of peyote for religious use, even if Oregon were to allow an exemption from its criminal laws, would still be strictly controlled by federal regulations, <em>see</em> 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 821-823 (registration requirements for distribution of controlled substances); 21 CFR \xc2\xa7 1307.31 (1989) (distribution of peyote to Native American Church subject to registration requirements), and by the State of Texas, the only State in which peyote grows in significant quantities.  <em>See</em> Texas Health &amp; Safety Code, \xc2\xa7 481.111 (1990); Texas Admin.Code, Tit. 37, pt. 1, ch. 13, Controlled Substances Regulations, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13.35-1-3.41 (1989); <em>Woody,</em> 61 Cal.2d at 720, 394 P.2d at 816 (peyote is "found in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and northern Mexico").  Peyote simply is not a popular drug; its distribution for use in religious rituals has nothing to do with the vast and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this country.</p>\n<p>Finally, the State argues that granting an exception for religious peyote use would erode its interest in the uniform, fair, and certain enforcement of its drug laws.  The State fears that, if it grants an exemption for religious peyote use, a flood of other claims to religious exemptions will follow.  It would then be placed in a dilemma, it says, between allowing a patchwork of exemptions that would hinder its law enforcement efforts, and risking a violation of the Establishment Clause by arbitrarily limiting its religious exemptions.  This </p><p><a class="page-number" name="917">Page 494 U. S. 917</a></p><p> argument, however, could be made in almost any free exercise case.   <em>See</em> Lupu, Where Rights Begin:  The Problem of Burdens on the Free Exercise of Religion, 102 Harv.L.Rev. 933, 947 (1989) ("Behind every free exercise claim is a spectral march; grant this one, a voice whispers to each judge, and you will be confronted with an endless chain of exemption demands from religious deviants of every stripe").  This Court, however, consistently has rejected similar arguments in past free exercise cases, and it should do so here as well.  <em>See Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/829/case.html">489 U.

Almost half the States, and the Federal Government, have maintained an exemption for religious peyote use for many years, and apparently have not found themselves overwhelmed by claims to other religious exemptions. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Allowing an exemption for religious peyote use </p><p><a class="page-number" name="918">Page 494 U. S. 918</a></p><p> would not necessarily oblige the State to grant a similar exemption to other religious groups.  The unusual circumstances that make the religious use of peyote compatible with the State\'s interests in health and safety and in preventing drug trafficking would not apply to other religious claims.  Some religions, for example, might not restrict drug use to a limited ceremonial context, as does the Native American Church.  <em>See, e.g., Olsen,</em> 279 U.S.App.D.C., at 7, 878 F.2d at 1464 ("the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church . . . teaches that marijuana is properly smoked <em>continually all day\'").  Some religious claims, <em>see</em> n. 8, <em>supra,</em> involve drugs such as marijuana and heroin, in which there is significant illegal traffic, with its attendant greed and violence, so that it would be difficult to grant a religious exemption without seriously compromising law enforcement efforts. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  That the State might grant an exemption for religious peyote use, but deny other religious claims arising in different circumstances, would not violate the Establishment Clause.  Though the State must treat all religions equally, and not favor one over another, this obligation is fulfilled by the uniform application of the "compelling interest" <em>test</em> to all free exercise claims, not by reaching uniform <em>results</em> as to all claims.  A showing that religious peyote use does not unduly interfere with the State\'s interests is "one that probably few other religious groups or sects could make,"  <em>Yoder,</em> 406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/205/case.html#236">406 U. S. 236</a></span>; this does not mean that an exemption limited to peyote use is tantamount to an establishment of religion.  <em>See Hobbie v.

[just as] baptism, the confessional, or a sabbath may be for others," enforcement of State\'s compulsory education law would "gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\' religious beliefs").</p>\n<p>Respondents believe, and their sincerity has never been at issue, that the peyote plant embodies their deity, and eating it is an act of worship and communion.  Without peyote, they could not enact the essential ritual of their religion.  <em>See</em> Brief for Association on American Indian Affairs, <em>et al.,</em> as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5-6 ("To the members, peyote is consecrated with powers to heal body, mind and spirit.  It is a teacher; it teaches the way to spiritual life through living in harmony and balance with the forces of the Creation.  The rituals are an integral part of the life process.  They embody a form of worship in which the sacrament Peyote is the means for communicating with the Great Spirit").  <em>See also</em> Stewart, Peyote Religion at 327-330 (description of peyote ritual); </p><p><a class="page-number" name="920">Page 494 U.

S. 218</a></span>.  This potentially devastating impact must be viewed in light of the federal policy -- reached in reaction to many years of religious persecution and intolerance -- of protecting the religious freedom of Native Americans.  <em>See</em> American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 92 Stat. 469, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1996 ("it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions . . . , including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites"). [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Congress recognized that certain substances, such as peyote,</p>\n<p>"have religious significance because they are sacred, they have power, they heal, they are necessary to the exercise of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="921">Page 494 U.

Otherwise, both the First Amendment and the stated policy of Congress will offer to Native Americans merely an unfulfilled and hollow promise.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>For these reasons, I conclude that Oregon\'s interest in enforcing its drug laws against religious use of peyote is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh respondents\' right to the free exercise of their religion.  Since the State could not constitutionally enforce its criminal prohibition against respondents, the interests underlying the State\'s drug laws cannot justify its denial of unemployment benefits.  Absent such justification, the State\'s regulatory interest in denying benefits for religiously motivated "misconduct," <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/case.html#874">494 U.

I have grave doubts, however, as to the wisdom or propriety of deciding the constitutionality of a criminal prohibition which the State has not sought to enforce, which the State did not rely on in defending its denial of unemployment benefits before the state courts, and which the Oregon courts could, on remand, either invalidate on state constitutional grounds or conclude that it remains irrelevant to Oregon\'s interest in administering its unemployment benefits program.</p>\n<p>It is surprising, to say the least, that this Court, which so often prides itself about principles of judicial restraint and reduction of federal control over matters of state law, would stretch its jurisdiction to the limit in order to reach, in this abstract setting, the constitutionality of Oregon\'s criminal prohibition of peyote use.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The only reported case in which the State of Oregon has sought to prosecute a person for religious peyote use is <em>State v.

Employment Division,</em> 307 Ore. 68, 73, n. 2, 763 P.2d 146, 148, n. 2 (1988).  Although this does not prove that Oregon must have such an exception too, it is significant that these States, and the Federal Government, all find their (presumably compelling) interests in controlling the use of dangerous drugs compatible with an exemption for religious use of peyote.  <em>Cf.
