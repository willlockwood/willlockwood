JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission seeks reversal of the action of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in modifying the cease and desist order which the Commission had issued against the respondent Broch on finding that Broch violated \xc2\xa7 2(c) of the Clayton Act. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  285 F.2d 764.  The action of the Court of Appeals was <em>sua sponte,</em> and was taken in proceedings on remand which followed our reversal of that Court\'s earlier action setting aside the order in its entirety because Broch\'s conduct was thought not to violate \xc2\xa7 2(c). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Federal Trade Comm\'n v. Broch &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/166/case.html">363 U. S. 166</a></span>, <em>reversing</em> 261 F.2d 725.  We granted certiorari, 366 U.S. 923.</p>\n<p>Broch is a broker selling food products on commission for some 25 seller principals.  One of his principals is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 368 U. S. 362</a></p><p> Canada Foods, Ltd., a processor of apple concentrate.  The Commission found that Broch, to make possible Canada Foods\' acceptance of an offer from J. M. Smucker Co. to buy an unusually large quantity of apple concentrate at less than Canada Foods\' established price, reduced to 3%, for this sale, the agreed 5% rate of commission ordinarily payable by Canada Foods to Broch. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Commission adjudged, and in our prior opinion we agreed, that this action of Broch was, in the circumstances, a violation of \xc2\xa7 2(c).</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s order was not confined to restraints against repetition of the precise violation of \xc2\xa7 2(c) which Broch was found to have committed, nor was the application of the order limited to future sales from Canada Foods to Smucker. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Paragraph (1) did prohibit the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 368 U. S. 363</a></p><p> repetition of the particular violation which Broch committed, but in connection with sales for Canada Foods, or for "any other seller principal," to Smucker, or "to any other buyer."  Paragraph (2) also extended its prohibitions to sales from all seller principals to all buyers, but went beyond paragraph (1) to prohibit Broch from "In any other manner . . . directly or indirectly" paying, granting or allowing, in the words of \xc2\xa7 2(c), "anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof. . . ."  The Court of Appeals excised from the order all references to "any other seller principal" and to "any other buyer," thus limiting the order\'s application to future sales from Canada Foods to Smucker.</p>\n<p>The Commission renews here the argument it made in the Court of Appeals that judicial modification of the order was precluded because Broch failed to object to the scope of the order before the Commission.  Broch disputes that he failed to register a proper objection before the Commission.  We see no reason to determine the fact.  We will assume, without deciding, that the Court of Appeals properly passed upon the scope of the order.  We nevertheless think that, in the circumstances of this case, the order should have been affirmed in the form entered by the Commission.</p>\n<p>Broch supports the action of the Court of Appeals as to paragraph (1) of the order with the argument that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 368 U. S. 364</a></p><p> since the order was based only upon findings limited to an asserted illegal payment respecting a single sale from Canada Foods to Smucker, the Commission\'s ban was too sweeping in its application to sales from all seller principals to all buyers.  There is no merit in this argument.  The Commission has a wide discretion to formulate a remedy adequate to prevent Broch\'s repetition of the violation he was found to have committed.  <em>See Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/608/case.html">327 U. S. 608</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/608/case.html#611">327 U. S. 611</a></span>-612.  We cannot say that the Commission exceeded its discretion in banning repetitions of Broch\'s violation in connection with transactions involving any seller and buyer, rather than simply forbidding recurrence of the transgression in sales between Canada and Smucker.  <em>Federal Trade Comm\'n v. Cement Institute,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/683/case.html">333 U. S. 683</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/683/case.html#728">333 U. S. 728</a></span>-729.  <em>Compare United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/76/case.html">340 U. S. 76</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/76/case.html#90">340 U. S. 90</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Broch further argues that the Commission exceeded its discretion in the prohibitions embodied in paragraph (2).  He did not cross-petition this Court for a writ of certiorari, and does not here challenge paragraph (2) as modified by the Court of Appeals.  Had the only vice claimed in paragraph (2) been its extension to all seller principals and all buyers, the Court of Appeals\' <em>sua sponte</em> amendment would, for reasons already stated, have been clearly erroneous.  But Broch contends that, before it was restricted to transactions involving Canada and Smucker, this part of the order was so broad as to jeopardize the conduct of his entire business, in that it unqualifiedly prohibited reductions of commissions coupled with lower prices -- even uniform reductions, or reductions which are service- or cost-justified, or reductions for the purpose of meeting competition.</p>\n<p>In considering Broch\'s challenge to paragraph (2), it is necessary to observe that the 1959 amendments to \xc2\xa7 11 of the Clayton Act -- which substitute for the Clayton Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 368 U. S. 365</a></p><p> provisions for enforcement of administrative orders those in \xc2\xa7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act -- do not apply to enforcement of the instant order. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In consequence, Broch cannot be subjected to penalties except for violation of an enforcement order yet to be entered by an appropriate Court of Appeals, to be predicated upon a determination that some particular practice of Broch violated the Commission\'s order.  Thus Broch, is not, by virtue of that order, presently acting under the risk of incurring any penalty without further administrative and judicial consideration and interpretation, despite the fact that he has already received determination of his petition for review.  <em>Federal Trade Comm\'n v. Ruberoid Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/470/case.html">343 U.

S. 366</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Upon any future enforcement proceeding, the Commission and the Court of Appeals will have ready at hand interpretive tools -- the employment of which we have previously sanctioned -- for use in tailoring the order, in the setting of a specific asserted violation, so as to meet the legitimate needs of the case.  They will be free to construe the order as designed strictly to cope with the threat of future violations identical with or like or related to the violations which Broch was found to have committed, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] or as forbidding "no activities except those which if continued would directly aid in perpetuating the same old unlawful practices."  <em>Federal Trade Comm\'n v.

They need not -- as we have already made clear -- read the order as denying </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 368 U. S. 367</a></p><p> to Broch the benefit of statutory defenses or exceptions.  <em>Federal Trade Comm\'n v.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Nor need the order be construed as prohibiting anything as clearly lawful as a uniform reduction in commissions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  And, we repeat, these various interpretive aids will have to be brought to bear by a Court of Appeals upon a particular practice of Broch, and will have to yield the announced result that such practice violates the order, before Broch can be subjected to penalties because of still a second repetition of the violation.</p>\n<p>In this situation, and on this record, we hold that the attempt of the Court of Appeals to redress the asserted overbroadness by the inapt device of confining paragraph (2) to Canada\'s sales to Smucker was inappropriate and, indeed, any attempt to restrict the scope of the order would have been premature.</p>\n<p>We do not wish to be understood, however, as holding that the generalized language of paragraph (2) would necessarily withstand scrutiny under the 1959 amendments.

In opposing the motion, the Commission claimed that Broch had not objected to the scope of the order in the proceedings before the Commission or in the original review proceedings, and was therefore not entitled to have the Court entertain the motion.  Broch\'s motion was denied, but the order embodying the denial also included the provision questioned here amending the order "On the Court\'s own motion."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>There was evidence in the proceedings before the Commission that, following the transaction described above, Broch continued to sell apple concentrate to Smucker on behalf of Canada Foods at a reduced price and to receive a reduced commission of 3% on such sales.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s order was as follows:</p>\n<p>"<em>It is ordered</em> That respondents Henry Broch and Oscar Adler, copartners trading as Henry Broch &amp; Co., their representatives, agents, or employees, directly or through any corporate or other device, in connection with the sale of food or food products for Canada Foods Ltd., or any other seller principal, in commerce, as \'commerce\' is defined in the Clayton Act, as amended, do forthwith cease and desist from:"</p>\n<p>"(1) Paying, granting or allowing, directly or indirectly, to The J.

The order herein was entered by the Commission on December 10, 1957.  The procedures enacted by the 1959 amendments therefore do not apply to it.  <em>See Sperry Rand Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm\'n,</em> 110 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 288 F.2d 403.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1959 Amendments resulted from a congressional conclusion that the former \xc2\xa7 11 procedures were too cumbersome to assure effective enforcement of agency orders.  It was said in the House Committee Report accompanying the 1959 amendments:</p>\n<p>"The Clayton Act, in its present enforcement procedures, permits a person to engage in the same illegal practices three times before effective legal penalties can be applied as a result of action by the commission or board vested with jurisdiction.  First, in order to issue and serve a cease and desist order initially, the commission or board must investigate and prove that the respondent has violated the prohibitions of the Clayton Act.  No provision of the Clayton Act, however, makes the commission or board\'s cease and desist order final in the absence of an appeal by the respondent for judicial review.  At the present time, the Clayton Act contains no procedure by which the commission or board may secure civil penalties for violations of its orders."</p>\n<p>"Second, before the commission or board may obtain a court ruling that commands obedience to its cease and desist order, it must again investigate and prove that the respondent has violated both the order and the Clayton Act.  The jurisdiction of the court of appeals, under the present provisions of Clayton Act section 11, cannot be invoked by the commission or board unless a violation of the cease and desist order is first shown."</p>\n<p>"Third, enforcement of the court\'s order must be secured in a subsequent contempt proceeding, which requires proof that new activities of the respondent have violated the court\'s order.  This entails a third hearing before the commission and a review thereof by the court of appeals."</p>\n<p>"In contrast, the procedures that are contained in the Federal Trade Commission Act for enforcement of cease and desist orders issued thereunder are much simpler and more direct.  A cease and desist order issued pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition is filed within that time."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR.

This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the prior appeal largely on the very narrow ground that petitioner\'s "reduction in brokerage was made to obtain this particular order and this order only . . . ," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 368 U.
