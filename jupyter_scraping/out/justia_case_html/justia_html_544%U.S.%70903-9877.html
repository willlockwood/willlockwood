Respondents moved to dismiss that claim, arguing, among other things, that \xc2\xa73, on its face, improperly advances religion in violation of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause.  Rejecting that argument, the District Court stated that RLUIPA permits safety and security\xe2\x80\x94undisputedly compelling state interests\xe2\x80\x94to outweigh an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s claim to a religious accommodation.  On the thin record before it, the court could not find that enforcement of RLUIPA, inevitably, would compromise prison security.  Reversing on interlocutory appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that \xc2\xa73 impermissibly advances religion by giving greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights, and suggested that affording religious prisoners superior rights might encourage prisoners to become religious.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section 3 of RLUIPA, on its face, qualifies as a permissible accommodation that is not barred by the Establishment Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Foremost, \xc2\xa73 is compatible with the Establishment Clause because it alleviates exceptional government-created burdens on private religious exercise.  See, <em>e.g., Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist.</em> v. <em>Grumet,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/687/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/687/index.html">512 U. S. 687</a>, 705.  Furthermore, the Act on its face does not founder on shoals the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior decisions have identified: Properly applying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries, see <em>Estate of Thornton</em> v. <em>Caldor, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/703/index.html">472 U. S. 703</a>; and they must be satisfied that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions are and will be administered neutrally among different faiths, see <em>Kiryas Joel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/687/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/687/index.html">512 U. S. 687</a>.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98exercise of religion\xe2\x80\x99 often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of \xe2\x80\xa6 physical acts [such as] assembling with others for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and wine \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U. S. 872</a>, 877.  Section 3 covers state-run institutions\xe2\x80\x94mental hospitals, prisons, and the like\xe2\x80\x94in which the government exerts a degree of control unparalleled in civilian society and severely disabling to private religious exercise.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931(a); \xc2\xa71997.  RLUIPA thus protects institutionalized persons who are unable freely to attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent on the government\xe2\x80\x99s permission and accommodation for exercise of their religion.  But the Act does not elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institution\xe2\x80\x99s need to maintain order and safety.  An accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.  See <em>Caldor, </em>472 U. S., at 709\xe2\x80\x93710.  There is no reason to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way, with particular sensitivity to security concerns.  While the Act adopts a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d standard, \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931(a), \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters\xe2\x80\x9d in the application of that standard, see <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 327.  Lawmakers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of the urgency of discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions and anticipated that courts would apply the Act\xe2\x80\x99s standard with due deference to prison administrators\xe2\x80\x99 experience and expertise.  Finally, RLUIPA does not differentiate among bona fide faiths.  It confers no privileged status on any particular religious sect.  Cf. <em>Kiryas Joel,</em> 512 U. S., at 706.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit misread this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as impermissibly advancing religion by giving greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights.  <em>Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&amp;nbhyph;day Saints</em> v. <em>Amos,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/327/index.html">483 U. S. 327</a>, counsels otherwise.  There, in upholding against an Establishment Clause challenge a provision exempting religious organizations from the prohibition against religion-based employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court held that religious accommodations need not \xe2\x80\x9ccome packaged with benefits to secular entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 338.  Were the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view correct, all manner of religious accommodations would fall.  For example, Ohio could not, as it now does, accommodate traditionally recognized religions by providing chaplains and allowing worship services.  In upholding \xc2\xa73, the Court emphasizes that respondents have raised a facial challenge and have not contended that applying RLUIPA would produce unconstitutional results in any specific case.  There is no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden state and local institutions.  However, should inmate requests for religious accommodations become excessive, impose unjustified burdens on other institutionalized persons, or jeopardize an institution\xe2\x80\x99s effective functioning, the facility would be free to resist the imposition.  In that event, adjudication in as-applied challenges would be in order.

The District Court denied respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaints, but the Court of Appeals reversed that determination.  The appeals court held, as the prison officials urged, that the portion of RLUIPA applicable to institutionalized persons, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931, violates the Establishment Clause.  We reverse the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court has long recognized that the government may \xe2\x80\xa6 accommodate religious practices \xe2\x80\xa6 without violating the Establishment Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hobbie</em> v. <em>Unemployment Appeals Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Fla.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/136/index.html">480 U.

Ten years before RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the Court held, in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U.

In particular, we ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not bar Oregon from enforcing its blanket ban on peyote possession with no allowance for sacramental use of the drug.  Accordingly, the State could deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of their religiously inspired peyote use.  <em>Id.</em>, at 874, 890.  The Court recognized, however, that the political branches could shield religious exercise through legislative accommodation, for example, by making an exception to proscriptive drug laws for sacramental peyote use.  <em>Id.</em>, at 890.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Responding to <em>Smith</em>, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.

Less sweeping than RFRA, and invoking federal authority under the Spending and Commerce Clauses, RLUIPA targets two areas: Section 2 of the Act concerns land-use regulation, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc;[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] \xc2\xa73 relates to religious exercise by institutionalized persons, \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931.

In <em>Goldman</em> v. <em>Weinberger,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/503/index.html">475 U.

Our decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.  In <em>Caldor, </em>the Court struck down a Connecticut law that \xe2\x80\x9carm[ed] Sabbath observers with an absolute and unqualified right not to work on whatever day they designate[d] as their Sabbath.\xe2\x80\x9d  472 U.

While the Act adopts a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling governmental interest\xe2\x80\x9d standard, see <em>supra</em>, at 5, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontext matters\xe2\x80\x9d in the application of that standard.  See <em>Grutter</em> v. <em>Bollinger, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/306/index.html">539 U. S. 306</a>, 327 (2003).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Lawmakers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of the urgency of discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 139 Cong. Rec. 26190 (1993) (remarks of Senator Hatch).  They anticipated that courts would apply the Act\xe2\x80\x99s standard with \xe2\x80\x9cdue deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Joint Statement S7775 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

In <em>Kiryas Joel,</em> we invalidated a state law that carved out a separate school district to serve exclusively a community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar Hasidim.  We held that the law violated the Establishment Clause, 512 U. S., at 690, in part because it \xe2\x80\x9csingle[d] out a particular religious sect for special treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 706 (footnote omitted).  RLUIPA presents no such defect.  It confers no privileged status on any particular religious sect, and singles out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit misread our precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly advancing religion by giving greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  349 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 264.  Our decision in <em>Amos </em>counsels otherwise.  There, we upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a provision exempting \xe2\x80\x9creligious organizations from Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against discrimination in employment on the basis of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  483 U.

The District Court in <em>Amos</em>, reasoning in part that the exemption improperly \xe2\x80\x9csingle[d] out religious entities for a benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 338, had \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared the statute unconstitutional as applied to secular activity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 333.  Religious accommodations, we held, need not \xe2\x80\x9ccome packaged with benefits to secular entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 338; see <em>Madison</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 318 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no requirement that legislative protections for fundamental rights march in lockstep.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view the correct reading of our decisions, all manner of religious accommodations would fall.

The District Court, noting the underdeveloped state of the record, concluded: A finding \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is <em>factually impossible</em> to provide the kind of accommodations that RLUIPA will require without significantly compromising prison security or the levels of service provided to other inmates\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be made at this juncture.  <em>Id.</em>, at 848 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  We agree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFor more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the Nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA without compromising prison security, public safety, or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 24 (citation omitted).

I agree with the Court that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) is constitutional under our modern Establishment Clause case law.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  I write to explain why a proper historical understanding of the Clause as a federalism provision leads to the same conclusion.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Establishment Clause provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amdt. 1.  As I have explained, an important function of the Clause was to \xe2\x80\x9cma[ke] clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</em> v. <em>Newdow,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/1/index.html">542 U. S. 1</a>, 50 (2004) (opinion concurring in judgment).  The Clause, then, \xe2\x80\x9cis best understood as a federalism provision\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cprotects state establishments from federal interference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U.

S. 577</a>, 641 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Ohio contends that this federalism understanding of the Clause prevents federal oversight of state choices within the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98play in the joints\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses.  <em>Locke</em> v. <em>Davey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/712/index.html">540 U. S. 712</a>, 718\xe2\x80\x93719 (2004).  In other words, Ohio asserts that the Clause protects the States from federal interference with otherwise constitutionally permissible choices regarding religious policy.  In Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s view, RLUIPA intrudes on such state policy choices and hence violates the Clause.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s vision of the range of protected state authority overreads the Clause.  Ohio and its <em>amici</em> contend that, even though \xe2\x80\x9cStates can no longer establish preferred churches\xe2\x80\x9d because the Clause has been incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is as unable as ever to contravene constitutionally permissible <em>State choices regarding religious policy</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 26 (emphasis added); Brief for Commonwealth of Virginia et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6\xe2\x80\x9313.  That is not what the Clause says.  The Clause prohibits Congress from enacting legislation \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an <em>establishment</em> of religion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added); it does not prohibit Congress from enacting legislation \xe2\x80\x9crespecting religion\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctaking cognizance of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 106\xe2\x80\x93107 (2002).  At the founding, establishment involved \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support <em>by force of law and threat of penalty</em>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Newdow,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 52 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Lee,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (Scalia, J., dissenting, in turn citing L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 4 (1986))), including \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98governmental preferences for <em>particular</em> religious faiths,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 542 U. S., at 53 (quoting <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U. S. 819</a>, 856 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring)).  In other words, establishment at the founding involved, for example, mandatory observance or mandatory payment of taxes supporting ministers.  See 542 U. S., at 52 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Lee,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (Scalia, J., dissenting); McConnell 2131; Levy, The Establishment Clause 10 (2d ed. 1994).  To proscribe Congress from making laws \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, was to forbid legislation respecting coercive state establishments, not to preclude Congress from legislating on religion generally.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.\xe2\x80\x9d  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J.\xc2\xa0Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell\xe2\x80\x99s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.\xe2\x80\x9d  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These quotations do not establish the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison\xe2\x80\x99s or Iredell\xe2\x80\x99s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An <em>unenacted</em> version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a>, 96\xe2\x80\x9397 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  The words ultimately adopted, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cidentified a position from which [Madison] had once sought to distinguish his own,\xe2\x80\x9d Hamburger, <em>supra</em>, at 106.  Whatever he thought of those words, \xe2\x80\x9che clearly did not mind language less severe than that which he had [previously] used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The version of the Clause finally adopted is narrower than Ohio claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the other historical evidence on which Ohio relies\xe2\x80\x94Joseph Story\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries on the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94prove its theory.  Leaving aside the problems with relying on this source as an indicator of the original understanding, see <em>U. S. Term Limits, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thornton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/779/index.html">514 U. S. 779</a>, 856 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting), it is unpersuasive in its own right.  Justice Story did say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702\xe2\x80\x93703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress\xe2\x80\x99 inability to legislate with respect to religious <em>establishment</em>.  See <em>id.,</em> at 701 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe real object of the amendment was \xe2\x80\xa6 to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 702 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was deemed advisable to exclude from the national government all power to act upon the subject\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. It was impossible, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the national government were left free to create a religious establishment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion\xe2\x80\x9d; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face\xe2\x80\x94the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge\xe2\x80\x94RLUIPA is not a law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: \xe2\x80\x9cNo government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, \xe2\x80\xa6 even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,\xe2\x80\x9d first, \xe2\x80\x9cfurther[s] a compelling governmental interest,\xe2\x80\x9d and second, \xe2\x80\x9cis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including \xe2\x80\x9crule[s] of general applicability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S. __, __ (2005) (slip op., at 2) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a>, 745 (1987).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States\xe2\x80\x99 receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x931(b)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis section applies in any case in which \xe2\x80\xa6 the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance\xe2\x80\x9d).  As noted above, n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress\xe2\x80\x99 condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States\xe2\x80\x99 voluntary acceptance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 condition undercuts Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/index.html">403 U.

S., at 612\xe2\x80\x93613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, any accommodation of religion\xe2\x80\x94might well violate the Clause.  Even laws <em>disestablishing</em> religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthen and revitalize\xe2\x80\x9d religion and so fail the second.
