S. 174</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>This suit was instituted on a bond taken in pursuance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 10 U. S. 175</a></p><p> of the original embargo act, with a condition that the cargo of the schooner <em>Mary,</em> a sea letter vessel, should be relanded in the port of East Portland or some other port of the United States, "the dangers of the seas only excepted."</p>\n<p>Her cargo was not relanded within the United States, but was carried to Porto Rico and sold.  The defendants allege that they were driven by stress of weather into Porto Rico, where the cargo was landed by order of the government, and they insist that the case is within the exception contained in the condition of the bond.  The circuit court instructed the jury that if it believed the testimony, it was sufficient in law to bar the action.  To this opinion the counsel for the United States excepted, and its propriety is now to be considered.</p>\n<p>The improbability of the allegations made by the defendants is no longer the subject of inquiry.  The jury has verified them and the court must receive them as true.  The testimony is that the <em>Mary</em> was driven by tempestuous weather into a foreign port.  That while prosecuting her voyage, she encountered weather which so disabled both the crew and vessel and put her in such a situation that, to escape Nantucket Shoals, "she was obliged to change her course and endeavor to gain a southern port."  She changed her course and bore for Charleston.  But such was the condition of the crew and of the vessel, and so severe and so adverse were the winds that she "could not make Charleston, nor any other port of the United States, and was obliged to bear away for the West Indies to obtain relief."</p>\n<p>The vessel, then, was driven into Porto Rico by the cause which forms the exception in the condition of the bond, and if the cargo had been lost at the mouth of the harbor instead of entering the port, all would admit that the penalty of the bond had not been incurred.  But it is contended that the dangers of the seas terminated on entering the port, and that no sufficient cause is shown for not bringing back the cargo to the United States. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 10 U. S. 176</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The case states that the Governor of Porto Rico issued an order that the cargo should be landed and sold, "with which order the captain was obliged to comply."</p>\n<p>As this case is stated, the <em>Mary</em> was driven into Porto Rico, and the sale of her cargo, while there, was inevitable.  The dangers of the sea placed her in a situation which put it out of the power of the owners to reland her cargo within the United States.  The obligors, then, were prevented by the dangers of the seas from complying with the condition of the bond, for an effect which proceeds inevitably and of absolute necessity from a specified cause, must be ascribed to that cause.</p>\n<p>It is the unanimous opinion of this Court that there is no error in the proceedings of the circuit court, and that the judgment be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
