JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>These are criminal cases in which conviction of various defendants has been obtained in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California, Southern Division, and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, 144 F.2d 546.  They were charged with conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act, \xc2\xa7 1. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The parties to the alleged conspiracy were of two groups:  on the one hand, local manufacturers of and dealers in the commodities affected and their incorporated trade associations and officials thereof, and, on the other, unincorporated trade unions and their officials or business agents.  The indictment charged that the defendants below unlawfully combined and conspired together, successfully, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 330 U. S. 399</a></p><p> monopolize unduly a part of interstate commerce in millwork and patterned lumber.  The purpose and effect of the conspiracy was alleged to be to restrain out-of-state manufacturers from shipping and selling these commodities within the San Francisco Bay area of California, and to prevent the dealers in that area from freely handling them.  It was alleged that the conspiracy also sought to raise the prices of the products affected.  To achieve the purpose, a contract was entered into between the defendants for a wage scale for members of labor unions working on the articles involved, combined with a restrictive clause,</p>\n<p>". . . no material will be purchased from, and no work will be done on any material or article that has had any operation performed on same by Saw Mills, Mills, or Cabinet Shops, or their distributors that do not conform to the rates of wage and working conditions of this agreement,"</p>\n<p>with specified exceptions not here material.  This clause, it is alleged, was enforced to the mutual advantage of the conspirators by some of the parties through conference or picketing or acquiescence in the arrangement.  By means of the conspiracy, union workmen obtained better wages, the employers higher profits, and manufacturers against whom the conspiracy was directed were largely prevented from sharing in the Bay Area business, all to the price disadvantage of the consumer and the unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce.  The legal theory which was followed in their conviction was that conspiracies between employers and employees to restrain interstate commerce violate the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>Five petitions for certiorari were presented to this Court by different defendants, either singly or jointly with others.  It is sufficient for the purposes of this review to say that they raised the question of the application of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Sherman Act to conspiracies between employers and employees to restrain commerce and, except the petitions in the employer group, the application of \xc2\xa7 6 of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 330 U. S. 400</a></p><p> Norris-LaGuardia Act in trial of such an indictment. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On account of the importance of the federal questions raised and asserted conflicts in the circuits, the writs of certiorari were granted. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Since these cases were taken, the important question of the application of the Sherman Act to a conspiracy between labor union and business groups has been decided by us.  We held that such a conspiracy to restrain trade violated the Sherman Act.  <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/797/case.html">325 U. S. 797</a></span>.  This holding causes us to approve the ruling of the trial and appellate courts on the first question presented by the certiorari, but it left unresolved the question as to the application of \xc2\xa7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the point to which this decision is directed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 330 U. S. 401</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The indictment charges a conspiracy forbidden by the Sherman Act.  On that issue, the power of the trial court is limited by \xc2\xa7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.   <a href="#F2" name="T2">Note 2</a> <em>supra.</em>  The limitations of that section are upon all courts of the United States in all matters growing out of labor disputes, covered by the Act, which may come before them.  It properly is conceded that this agreement grew out of such a labor dispute, and that all parties defendant participated or were interested in that dispute.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 13, 47 Stat. 73.  Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act first appeared in a draft bill of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary as \xc2\xa7 6 thereof.  At that time, its form was precisely the same as at present.  The draft was drawn as a comprehensive substitute for S. 1482 of the 70th Congress, a bill providing only for a limitation on the jurisdiction of equity courts in the issuance of injunctions.  In the 71st Congress, a similarly limited bill on the same subject, S. 2497, was reintroduced, and a like comprehensive substitute proposed.  Neither substitute was reported out of the Committee. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  These substitute bills are quite similar in form to the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  In substance, and therefore in effectiveness, they are the same.</p>\n<p>In the next, the 72d Congress, the bill, H.R. 5315, which was to become the Norris-LaGuardia Act, was introduced.  Section 2 succinctly states the public policy that it was designed to further -- a definition of and limitation upon the jurisdiction and authority of courts of the United States in labor disputes. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  That purpose was in accord with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 330 U. S. 402</a></p><p> that behind the earlier drafts referred to above. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As the new bill was practically identical with these long considered committee substitutes, the hearings on H.R. 5315 were short. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But even so, the attack continued on \xc2\xa7 6 as a restriction on the general law of agency in labor disputes. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The reply of the House Committee was that it did "not affect the general law of agency," and was necessary "under the circumstances" so that</p>\n<p>"the courts should know that Congress expects them not to hold officers or associations liable for the unlawful acts of a member without clear proof of actual participation in, or authorization of, any unlawful acts by the officer or association. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Senate Committee was of the view that it was a "rule of evidence," not a "new law of agency."</p>\n<p>"There is no provision made relieving an individual from responsibility for his acts, but provision is made that a person shall not be held responsible for an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 330 U. S. 403</a></p><p> \'unlawful act\' except upon \'clear proof\' of participation or authorization or ratification.  Thus, a rule of evidence, not a rule of substantive law, is established. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]"</p>\n<p>We need not determine whether \xc2\xa7 6 should be called a rule of evidence or one that changes the substantive law of agency.  We hold that its purpose and effect was to relieve organizations, whether of labor or capital, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and members of those organizations from liability for damages or imputation of guilt for lawless acts done in labor disputes by some individual officers or members of the organization without clear proof that the organization or member, charged with responsibility for the offense, actually participated, gave prior authorization, or ratified such acts after actual knowledge of their perpetration. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 330 U. S. 404</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Thus, \xc2\xa7 6 limited responsibility for acts of a coconspirator -- a matter of moment to the advocates of the bill. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Before the enactment of \xc2\xa7 6, when a conspiracy between labor unions and their members, prohibited under the Sherman Act, was established, a widely publicized case had held both the unions and their members liable for all overt acts of their coconspirators. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  This liability resulted whether the members or the unions approved of the acts or not, or whether or not the acts were offenses under the criminal law.  While, of course, participants in a conspiracy that is covered by \xc2\xa7 6 are not immunized from responsibility for authorized acts in furtherance of such a conspiracy, they now are protected against liability for unauthorized illegal acts of other participants in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The legislative history makes the intended meaning of the word "authorization," we think, almost equally clear.  The rule of liability for acts of an agent within the scope of his authority, based on the <em>Danbury Hatters Case,</em> was urged as an argument against the language of \xc2\xa7 6. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  When </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 330 U. S. 405</a></p><p> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill, it dealt with this contention.</p>\n<p>"But the argument is made that a man is held legally responsible for the acts of his agents taken in due course of employment.  This argument is evidently based upon a doctrine of the civil law of negligence.  It has no application to the criminal law.  If a man is held responsible for an unlawful act, his responsibility rests on the basis of actual or implied participation.  He is responsible for conspiring to do </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 330 U. S. 406</a></p><p> an unlawful act or for setting in motion forces intended to result, or necessarily resulting, in an unlawful act."</p>\n<p>". . . it is high time that, by legislative action, the courts should be required to uphold the long established law that guilt is personal and that men can only be held responsible for the unlawful acts of associates because of participation in, authorization or ratification of such acts.  As a rule of evidence, clear proof should be required, so that criminal guilt and criminal responsibility should not be imputed but proven beyond reasonable doubt in order to impose liability. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]"</p>\n<p>We hold therefore that "authorization," as used in \xc2\xa7 6, means something different from corporate criminal responsibility for the acts of officers and agents in the course or scope of employment. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  We are of the opinion that the requirement of "authorization" restricts the responsibility or liability in labor disputes of employer or employee associations, organizations, or their members for unlawful acts of the officers or members of those associations or organizations, although such officers or members are acting within the scope of their general authority as such officers or members, to those associations, organizations, or their officers or members who actually participate in the unlawful acts, except upon clear proof that the particular act charged, or acts generally of that type and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 330 U. S. 407</a></p><p> quality, had been expressly authorized, or necessarily followed from a granted authority, by the association or nonparticipating member sought to be charged or was subsequently ratified by such association, organization, or member after actual knowledge of its occurrence.</p>\n<p>In this prosecution, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and all the local unions who were convicted requested an instruction or instructions that embodied the above interpretation of \xc2\xa7 6. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  A similar request was made by the individual members by requested instruction No. 58.  These requested instructions were refused, and, instead, instructions were given that stated a different concept of law, as is evidenced by the excerpts in the marginal note. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 330 U. S. 408</a></p><p></p>\n<p>So far as the Unions, both local and national, are concerned, the necessity under our construction for an instruction based on \xc2\xa7 6 is apparent.  The United Brotherhood was not a party to any of the agreements.  Local unions took a more definite part than the United Brotherhood.  In some instances, the name of a local union was signed to the agreement that contained the restrictive clause.  Necessarily, acts performed by or for the unions were done by their individual officers, members, or agents.  We do not enter into an analysis of the evidence that was relied upon to show the participation of the unions in the conspiracy.  The evidence in any new trial may be quite different.  No matter how strong the evidence may be of an association\'s or organization\'s participation through its agents in the conspiracy, there must be a charge to the jury setting out correctly the limited liability under \xc2\xa7 6 of such association or organization for acts of its agents. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  For a judge may not direct a verdict of guilty, no matter how conclusive the evidence. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  There is no way of knowing here whether the jury\'s verdict was based on facts within the condemned instructions,  <a href="#F19" name="T19">note 19 above</a> or on actual authorization or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 330 U. S. 409</a></p><p> ratification of such acts,  <a href="#F18" name="T18">note 18</a> [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  A failure to charge correctly is not harmless, since the verdict might have resulted from the incorrect instruction.  We are of the opinion, therefore, that the judge should have instructed the jury as to the limitations upon the association\'s liability for the acts of its agents under \xc2\xa7 6.  The error is aggravated by the failure to give the correct charge upon request.</p>\n<p>The suggestion is made that the alert and powerful unions and corporations gain the greatest degree of immunity under our interpretation of \xc2\xa7 6.  That is not the case.  Section 6 draws no distinction as to liability for unauthorized acts between the large and the small, between national unions and local unions, between powerful unions and weak unions, between associations or organizations and their members.  And we draw no such distinctions.</p>\n<p>There is no implication in what we have said that an association or organization in circumstances covered by \xc2\xa7 6 must give explicit authority to its officers or agents to violate in a labor controversy the Sherman Act or any other law, or to give antecedent approval to any act that its officers may do.  Certainly an association or organization cannot escape responsibility by standing orders disavowing authority on the part of its officers to make any agreements in violation of the Sherman Act and disclaiming union responsibility for such agreements.  Facile arrangements do not create immunity from the act, whether they are made by employee or by employer groups.  The conditions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 330 U. S. 410</a></p><p> of liability under \xc2\xa7 6 are the same in the case of each.  The grant of authority to an officer of a union to negotiate agreements with employers regarding hours, wages, and working conditions may well be sufficient to make the union liable.  An illustrative but nonrestrictive example might be where there was knowing participation by the union in the operation of the illegal agreement after its execution.  And the custom or traditional practice of a particular union can also be a source of actual authorization of an officer to act for and bind the union.</p>\n<p>Our only point is this:  Congress, in \xc2\xa7 6, has specified the standards by which the liability of employee and employer groups is to be determined.  No matter how clear the evidence, they are entitled to have the jury instructed in accordance with the standards which Congress has prescribed.  To repeat, guilt is determined by the jury, not the court.  The problem is not materially different from one where the evidence against an accused charged with a crime is well nigh conclusive and the court fails to give the reasonable doubt instruction.  It could not be said that the failure was harmless error. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>It is suggested that, since "conscious participation" was required for conviction by the instructions given, error as to the individual defendants cannot be found under any theory of the rule of \xc2\xa7 6.  But we think that failure to instruct the jury on the imputation of guilt from the acts of others as limited in labor disputes by \xc2\xa7 6 affects the individuals, as well as the associations.  The section covers organizations and their members alike.  Individuals, without association authority, may be guilty of such a conspiracy as this under the Sherman Act, but, under \xc2\xa7 6, they will not be guilty merely because they are members or officers of a guilty association.  Nor are individuals guilty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 330 U. S. 411</a></p><p> because of acts of other individuals in which they did not participate, or which they did not authorize or ratify.  Although an illegal conspiracy under the Sherman Act was proven at the trial, the individuals are entitled to have their participation weighed by a jury under an instruction explaining the circumstances under which \xc2\xa7 6 permits acts of other individuals or of associations or of organizations in labor disputes to create personal liability.  To instruct only that conscious participation of the individual is required leaves a jury free to weigh an individual\'s guilt in the light of unauthorized and unratified acts of others with whom he is associated but in whose acts he has not participated.  As the evidence of any individual\'s activities in the alleged conspiracy is a minor part of the evidence as to the entire scheme, this delimitation of his responsibility is important.</p>\n<p>Certiorari was granted to two employer groups, Nos. 8 and 10, each containing an incorporated trade association and its officers and members, both individual and corporate.  Both groups combatted the indictment by demurrer on the ground that, as the restrictive agreement was directed at the maintenance of proper working conditions, it did not state a crime under the Sherman Act.  The demurrer was overruled by the trial court.  Our decision in <em>Allen Bradley Co.</em> requires us to uphold this conclusion.  Thereafter, pleas of <em>nolo contendere</em> were entered by each defendant in the employer petitioner groups.</p>\n<p>Each of the employer petitioners, if they has stood trial, as we have indicated hereinbefore, would have been entitled to the same instruction under \xc2\xa7 6 as we have held the union group should have received.  And though the failure so to charge was not excepted to, we would not be precluded from entertaining the objection. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The erroneous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="412">Page 330 U. S. 412</a></p><p> charge was on a vital phase of the case, and affected the substantial rights of the defendants.  We have the power to notice a "plain error" though it is not assigned or specified. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  In view of their plea of <em>nolo contendere,</em> does justice require that these employer groups should now be given an opportunity to stand trail in the situation created by our subsequent rulings in the <em>Allen Bradley</em> case and in this case?  We think that it does.</p>\n<p>This present decision furnishes a guide for the application of \xc2\xa7 6 to liability for acts of agents in labor disputes.  Ordinarily a plea of <em>nolo contendere</em> leaves open for review only the sufficiency of an indictment. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  However, in view of the then existing uncertainty as to liability for contracts between groups of employers and groups of employees that restrained interstate commerce and the application of \xc2\xa7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia, we conclude that in this exceptional situation the employer groups, also, should have an opportunity to make defense to the indictment.

JUSTICE BURTON concur in result, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case is clear and simple.  It is this.  When officers make an arrangement on behalf of their organization, whether a corporation or a union, while acting in the regular course of business and within their general authority as such officers, is the organization liable for what these officers did if the court should subsequently find that such an arrangement is prohibited by the Sherman Law?  The issue is clear, and it is susceptible of a clear answer.  Neither the issue nor the answer should be obscured.  Either the organization is subject to the liability that the law in other respects imposes upon organizations for the acts of their agents, or the Norris-LaGuardia Act freed unions and corporations from such liability.  The lower courts must apply the law as laid down by this Court, and we owe them clarity of pronouncement.  They cannot very well guide juries, or even themselves in equity suits, if told that the principles of the law of agency do not apply to unions and corporations under the Sherman Law, but that perhaps they "can" apply.  What the Court means to decide ought to be brought out of the twilight of ambiguity.  It does not advance the administration of justice to impart new doubts to an old statute.  And the Sherman Law is not merely old.  It embodies, as this Court has often indicated, a vital policy.</p>\n<p>By explicit language, Congress forbade "corporations and associations" no less than individuals to engage in combinations and conspiracies in restraint of interstate trade.  Section 8 of the Sherman Law.  And it has long been settled that trade unions are "associations" under the Sherman Law.  <em>United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/344/case.html">259 U. S. 344</a></span>.  Before the <em>Coronado</em> decision and since, repeated efforts were made to have Congress take trade unions from under the Sherman Law.  Regardless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 330 U. S. 414</a></p><p> of the political complexion of Congress, these efforts have consistently failed.  Equally futile have been efforts to have this Court read the liability of trade unions out of the Sherman Law by judicial construction.  This Court has undeviatingly held that trade unions are within "the general interdict of the Sherman Law," although later enactments have withdrawn "specifically enumerated practices of labor unions" from the scope of that law.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 738; <em>United States v. Hutcheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html">312 U. S. 219</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html#230">312 U. S. 230</a></span>, and <em>Apex Hosiery Co. v.

S. 469</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/469/case.html#487">310 U. S. 487</a></span>.  In the light of this history, it would be strange indeed to find that Congress, by hitherto unsuspected indirection, had, from the point of view of effectiveness, sterilized the Sherman Law as to trade unions, and particularly as to those which alone could to any serious extent unreasonably restrain commerce.  It is a conclusion which can be reached only by disregarding the circumstances to which \xc2\xa7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was addressed, and by wrenching it from the context of history in which it must be read. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The construction given by the Court to \xc2\xa7 6 is based on considerations which move in a world of unreality.  The argument is quite unmindful of the way in which trade unions function -- their organization, the authority of their international officers, the inevitable influence of the international office upon the affiliated locals.  In short, such a construction is unmindful of the anatomy and physiology of trade union life.  It is especially the powerful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 330 U. S. 415</a></p><p> international unions who are in strategic positions to impose unreasonable restraints on commerce, and it is these that are especially rendered immune by the construction the Court gives to \xc2\xa7 6.  It is such unions that can most readily be insulated from responsibility for the acts of their leading officers, although such action be taken in furtherance of the vital concerns of the union and in every other aspect of legal responsibility be deemed within the direct authority of these officers and binding on the union.</p>\n<p>It took some time for the law to catch up with reality and to hold that, when men aggregated to form an entity, the entity, as such, acquires power, and may therefore be held to responsibility in exerting its power.  But it can act only through individuals.  Its power is exerted, and its responsibility accrues, through the conduct of individual men entrusted with the power of the entity to achieve its purposes.  This conclusion, supported alike by morality and by reason, the early law escaped through empty subtleties that seem fanciful to the modern reader.  Arguments not unlike them underlie a reading of \xc2\xa7 6 whereby the Sherman Law will be sterilized -- certainly so far as national labor unions are concerned.  The Court\'s opinion, to be sure, does not say in words that a national union is not liable under the Sherman Law for acts by its chief officers undertaken in the course of duty and for the furtherance of the union\'s purposes.  But the conditions formulated by the Court, which must now be met before a union may be held to liability, are practically unrealizable, whether in the case of a big or a small union, a local or an international.  Escape from responsibility can be easily contrived.  It will be difficult to charge a union with culpability unless a convention of its membership, held perhaps every two years or even four, should knowingly authorize or approve a violation of the Sherman Law, or give <em>carte blanche</em> to the officers of the union by approving </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 330 U. S. 416</a></p><p> in advance whatever they may do, no matter what the legal significance.  For instance, if the president of an international union should negotiate an agreement with employers regarding hours and wages and working conditions, his union will not be responsible for the agreement, under the rule now laid down by the Court, if it should turn out to run counter to the Sherman Law, although making agreements to promote the economic betterment of its membership is the aim of the union and the job of its president.</p>\n<p>The case before us illustrates how an association like the Brotherhood pursues its objectives.  The Locals took no action until the General Office of the Brotherhood offered its approval; the President of the Brotherhood himself took an active part in the contract negotiations; a representative of the Brotherhood was present at the time that the contracts were made; no union agreement was forthcoming until the General Office approved the contracts in the routine way for such approval -- collective agreements are not ordinarily subject to approval at the quadrennial convention of the Brotherhood; a circular issued by the General Office requested adherence to the contracts by the members of the local.  Surely here was active "participation" by the Brotherhood in what has been found to be an outlawed combination, in the normal way in which such a union exerts its authority and "participates" in agreements.  On such evidence did the jury find the Brotherhood guilty.</p>\n<p>The Court finds that there was error in not giving a requested charge which was in the language of the statute.  A trial court does not discharge its duty merely by quoting a statute relevant to the conduct of the trial.  The issue before an appellate court is not whether the trial judge might have given a request of abstract correctness, or even charged differently, but whether the judge\'s instructions were accurate and ample.  It might have been wise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 330 U. S. 417</a></p><p> for the judge to emphasize the counsel of care embodied in \xc2\xa7 6.  But the failure to do so or to use the statutory formula is not the Court\'s basis for upsetting the convictions.  The Court upsets the convictions because it deems erroneous the view which the trial court took of \xc2\xa7 6.  The holding is that the view which the trial court should have taken, which all trial courts will have to take hereafter, and which, whatever the language used in the charge, must control a jury\'s findings from the evidence, is the elucidation which the Court now gives to \xc2\xa7 6.  For practical purposes, this elucidation immunizes unions and corporate offenders for acts which their agents perform because they are agents, and, as such, endowed with authority.  For practical purposes, a union or a corporation could not be convicted on any evidence likely to exist if the trial court has to charge what the Court now holds to be required by \xc2\xa7 6.</p>\n<p>The trial court repeatedly warned the jury that, to find guilt, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.  It instructed the jury that the guilt or innocence of labor unions should be determined in the same manner as that of corporations.  On the question of authorization, it charged that</p>\n<p>"The act of an agent done for or on behalf of a corporation and within the scope of his authority, or an act which an agent has assumed to do for a corporation while performing duties actually delegated to him, is deemed to be the act of the corporation."</p>\n<p>That statement correctly expresses the standard of guilt of corporations and unions under all other criminal statutes.  If it is not the standard for violations of the Sherman Law, it is only because the Court now reads in \xc2\xa7 6 an exception to the whole of the criminal law.  Presumably, trial courts will conscientiously apply the intendment of the opinion of the Court.  That means that they will have to charge juries that the rules of agency do not apply in Sherman Law cases -- there must be more to hold the union for the acts of its officers.  And "more" will not be found in view of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 330 U. S. 418</a></p><p> the practical workings of unions, reinforced by the safeguards they will naturally take on the basis of this decision.</p>\n<p>Aside from the actualities of trade union practice, the terms of \xc2\xa7 6, read in the light of its legislative history and its purpose, repel the result reached by the Court once "we free our minds from the notion that criminal statutes must be construed by some artificial . . . rule."  <em>United States v. Union Supply Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/215/50/case.html">215 U. S. 50</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/215/50/case.html#55">215 U. S. 55</a></span>.  To assure immunity to powerful unions collaborating with employers\' associations in disregard of the Sherman Law was not the purpose of \xc2\xa7 6, and the provision should not be so read.  This minor provision of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was directed against decisions by some of the federal courts in litigation involving industrial controversies.  The abuse was misapplication of the law of agency so that labor unions were held responsible for the conduct of individuals in whom was lodged no authority to wield the power of the union.  By undue extension of the doctrine of conspiracy, whereby the act of each conspirator is chargeable to all, unions were on occasion held responsible for isolated acts of individuals, believed in some instances to have been agents provocateurs who held a spurious membership in the union during a strike.  Congress merely aimed to curb such an abusive misapplication of the principle of agency.  It did not mean to change the whole legal basis of collective responsibility.  By talking about "actual authorization," Congress merely meant to emphasize that persons for whose acts a corporation or a union is to be held responsible should really be wielding authority for such corporation or union.</p>\n<p>The Congressional purpose behind \xc2\xa7 6, then, is clear. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  All that Congress sought to do was to eliminate an extraneous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 330 U. S. 419</a></p><p> doctrine that had crept into some of the decisions whereby organizations were held responsible not for acts of agents who had authority to act, but for every act committed by any member of the union merely because he was a member, or because he had some relation to the union, although not authorized by virtue of his position to act for the union in what he did.  And so Congress charged the federal courts with the duty to look sharply to the relation of the individual to the affairs of the organization, and not to confound individual with union unless the individual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 330 U. S. 420</a></p><p> is clothed with power by the union, in the ordinary way of union operation, in doing what he does for the union.  A basis for liability which has entered into the warp and woof of our law, as is true of the responsibility of collective bodies for the acts of their agents, should not be deemed to have been uprooted by an enactment which merely emphasizes that basis and rules out its distortions.  1932 was too late in the day for Congress not to have known that unions, like other organizations, act only through officers, and that unions do not, any more than do other organizations, explicitly instruct their officers to violate the Sherman Law.  Neither by inadvertence nor on purpose did Congress remove the legal liability of organizations for the conduct of officials who, within the limits of their authority, wield the power of those organizations.  It is not lightly to be assumed that Congress would thus turn back the clock of legal history a hundred years and disregard the practicalities of collective action by powerful organizations.</p>\n<p>Nor are the debilitating implications for Sherman Law enforcement of the construction now placed on \xc2\xa7 6 limited to their bearing on union activities.  Congress did not lay down one rule of liability for corporations and another for unions.  On the contrary, it subjected both groups of organizations to the same basis and measure of liability.  Both can act only through responsible agents, and both are responsible as organizations only through the acts of such agents.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 13(b) of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  If the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="421">Page 330 U. S. 421</a></p><p> liability of a union does not flow from the acts of responsible officers acting in the due course of their authority in the pursuit of union purposes, then a corporation "interested in a labor dispute" cannot be held liable for the acts of its responsible officers acting within their customary authority in pursuit of corporate purposes.  Violations of the Sherman Law by corporate officers acting on behalf of the corporation and pursuing its economic interest are not usually explicitly authorized by a formal vote of the Board of Directors, or by the stockholders in annual meeting assembled.</p>\n<p>The teaching of the present case can hardly fail.  To come under the Court\'s indulgent rule of immunity from liability for the acts of its officers, unions will not rest on a lack of affirmative authorization.  To make assurance doubly sure, they will, doubtless in good conscience, have standing orders disavowing authority on the part of their officers to make any agreements which may be found to be in violation of the Sherman Law.  So also, corporations "interested in a labor dispute," as, for instance, by combining to resist what they deem unreasonable labor demands, will, by the formality of a resolution at a directors\' meeting, disavow and disapprove any arrangements made by their officers which run afoul of the Sherman Law.  This may achieve immunity even though the officers are moving within the orbit of their normal authority, and are acting solely in the interests of their corporation.</p>\n<p>Words are symbols of meaning.  In construing \xc2\xa7 6, as in construing other enactments of Congress, meaning must be extracted from words as they are used in relation to their setting, with due regard to the evil which the legislation was designed to cure, as well as to the mischievous and startling consequences of one construction as against another.</p>\n<p>"Doubt, if there can be any, is not likely to survive a consideration of the mischiefs certain to be engendered. . . .  The mind rebels against the notion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 330 U. S. 422</a></p><p> that Congress . . . was willing to foster an opportunity for juggling so facile and so obvious."</p>\n<p>Cardozo, J., in <em>Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/319/case.html">286 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/319/case.html#329">286 U.

To insist that such is not the result intended by the Court is to deny the practical consequences of the Court\'s ruling.  For those entrusted with the enforcement of the Sherman Law, there may be found in the opinion words of promise to the ear, but the decision breaks the promise to the hope.</p>\n<p>In our view, the judgments below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"SEC. 6.

We want to apply that for this reason -- that, if it is unjust to hold all members of the union responsible for the acts of its officers and their members merely because of such membership, similarly it is unjust to hold the officers responsible during the strike merely because they pass on questions of this kind, that an attempt is here made to recognize the rules of law of agency in labor cases."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Hearings before Subcommittee of Senate Committee on Judiciary, S.1482, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 763.</p>\n<p>The Senate Committee reported this:</p>\n<p>"There has been a distinct conflict of opinion in the courts as to the degree of proof required.
