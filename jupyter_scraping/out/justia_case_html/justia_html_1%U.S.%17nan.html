And though in the case of Davey versus Turner tried in this Court September 1764,* it was ruled that an acknowledgement of the Deed on a private examination before a Justice of peace, was sufficient under a long Usage to sanctify her Deed, though not strictly agreeable to Law; yet here there was not even that acknowledgment, or private examination. </p><p> But it appearing in Evidence, that it had been the constant Usage of the Province formerly for Femes Covert to convey their Estates in this manner, without an acknowledgment or separate examination; And that there were a great number of valuable Estates held under such Titles, which it would be dangerous to impeach at this time of day, THE COURT gave a Charge to the Jury in favour of the Defendants, founded on the Maxim Communis Error facit Fus.
