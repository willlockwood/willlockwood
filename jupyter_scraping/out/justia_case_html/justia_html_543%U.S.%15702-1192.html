S. 809</a>, 814), or CERCLA \xc2\xa7107(a) (which empowers the Government to recover its response costs from potentially responsible persons (PRPs)).  Section 113(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107.  SARA also created a separate express right of contribution, \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B), for \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cooper Industries, Inc., owned four Texas properties until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc.  After operating those sites for several years, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated them when hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water.  Aviall notified the State of the contamination, but neither the State nor the Federal Government took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup.  Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State\xe2\x80\x99s supervision and sold them to a third party, but remains contractually responsible for $5 million or more in cleanup costs.  Aviall filed this action against Cooper to recover such costs.  The original complaint asserted, <em>inter alia</em>, a claim for cost recovery under \xc2\xa7107(a) and a separate claim for contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  Aviall later amended the complaint to, among other things, combine its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint claim that, pursuant to \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), sought contribution from Cooper as a PRP under \xc2\xa7107(a).  Granting Cooper summary judgment, the District Court held that Aviall had abandoned its freestanding \xc2\xa7107 claim, and that contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) was unavailable because Aviall had not been sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107.  The Fifth Circuit ultimately reversed, holding that \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107.  The court reasoned in part that \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7113(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s enabling clause did not mean \xe2\x80\x9cmay only.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A private party who has not been sued under CERCLA \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) may not obtain contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) from other liable parties.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 113(f)(1) does not authorize Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  This Court disagrees with Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7113(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s enabling clause should be read permissively, such that \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution.  First, the natural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in this context is that it authorizes certain contribution actions that satisfy the subsequent specified condition\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> those that occur \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a specified civil action\xe2\x80\x94and no others.  Second, reading \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) civil action, would render entirely superfluous the section\xe2\x80\x99s explicit \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d condition, as well as \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement.  This Court is loath to allow such a reading.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn,</em> 542 U. S. ___, ___.  Congress would not have bothered to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allowed contribution actions absent those conditions.  Section \xc2\xa7113(f)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause does not change the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  That clause\xe2\x80\x99s sole function is to clarify that \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) does nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cdiminish\xe2\x80\x9d any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), thereby rebutting any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive contribution cause of action available to a PRP.  The saving clause, however, does not itself establish a cause of action, nor expand \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) civil action, nor specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  Reading the clause to authorize \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that the Court must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect.  In light of provisions specifying two 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions beginning at the date of judgment, \xc2\xa7113(g)(3)(A), and at the date of settlement, \xc2\xa7113(g)(3)(B), the absence of any such provision for cases in which a judgment or settlement never occurs also supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under \xc2\xa7113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) or \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B).  Given the clear meaning of CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s text, there is no need to resolve the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute about CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose or to consult that purpose at all.  See <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79.  Because Aviall has never been subject to a civil action under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a), it has no \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) claim.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court declines to address in the first instance Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it may recover costs under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP.  In view of the importance of the \xc2\xa7107 issue, the question whether Aviall waived a freestanding \xc2\xa7107 claim, and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, this Court is not prepared to resolve the \xc2\xa7107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <em>Key Tronic.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0In addition, the Court declines to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under \xc2\xa7107.  To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its \xc2\xa7107 claim on remand as an implied right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery), the Court notes that it has visited the subject before, see, <em>e.g., Texas Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/630/index.html">451 U. S. 630</a>, 638\xe2\x80\x93647, and that, in enacting \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law, cf. <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/index.html">444 U.

Section 113(f)(1) specifies that a party may obtain contribution \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following any civil action\xe2\x80\x9d under CERCLA \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a).  The issue we must decide is whether a private party who has not been sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) may nevertheless obtain contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) from other liable parties.  We hold that it may not.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">I </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under CERCLA, 94 Stat. 2767, the Federal Government may clean up a contaminated area itself, see \xc2\xa7104, or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup, see \xc2\xa7106(a).  See <em>Key Tronic Corp.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/809/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/809/index.html">511 U. S. 809</a>, 814 (1994).  In either case, the Government may recover its response costs under \xc2\xa7107, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79607 (2000 ed. and Supp. I), the \xe2\x80\x9ccost recovery\xe2\x80\x9d section of CERCLA.  Section 107(a) lists four classes of potentially responsible persons (PRPs) and provides that they \xe2\x80\x9cshall be liable\xe2\x80\x9d for, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9call costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government \xe2\x80\xa6 not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(A).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Section 107(a) further provides that PRPs shall be liable for \xe2\x80\x9cany other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1980, litigation arose over whether \xc2\xa7107, in addition to allowing the Government and certain private parties to recover costs from PRPs, also allowed a PRP that had incurred response costs to recover costs from other PRPs.  More specifically, the question was whether a private party that had incurred response costs, but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subject to suit, had a cause of action for cost recovery against other PRPs.  Various courts held that \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wickland Oil Terminals </em>v.<em> Asarco, Inc.</em>, 792 F. 2d 887, 890\xe2\x80\x93892 (CA9 1986); <em>Walls </em>v. <em>Waste Resource Corp.</em>, 761 F. 2d 311, 317\xe2\x80\x93318 (CA6 1985); <em>Philadelphia</em> v. <em>Stepan Chemical Co.</em>, 544 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1135, 1140\xe2\x80\x931143 (ED Pa. 1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, litigation also ensued over the separate question whether a private entity that had been sued in a cost recovery action (by the Government or by another PRP) could obtain contribution from other PRPs.  As originally enacted in 1980, CERCLA contained no provision expressly providing for a right of action for contribution.  A number of District Courts nonetheless held that, although CERCLA did not mention the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution,\xe2\x80\x9d such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of the statute, or as a matter of federal common law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>New Castle County</em>, 642 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1258, 1263\xe2\x80\x931269 (Del. 1986) (contribution right arises under federal common law); <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>ASARCO, Inc.</em>, 608 F. Supp. 1484, 1486\xe2\x80\x931493 (Colo. 1985) (same); <em>Wehner </em>v. <em>Syntex Agribusiness, Inc.</em>, 616 F. Supp. 27, 31 (ED Mo. 1985) (contribution right is implied from \xc2\xa7107(e)(2)).  That conclusion was debatable in light of two decisions of this Court that refused to recognize implied or common-law rights to contribution in other federal statutes.  See <em>Texas Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Radcliff Materials, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/630/index.html">451 U. S. 630</a>, 638\xe2\x80\x93647 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act); <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Transport Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/77/index.html">451 U.

Such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall be governed by Federal law.  In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.  Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1647, as codified in 42 U.

Cooper Industries, Inc., owned and operated those sites until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc.  Aviall operated the four sites for a number of years.  Ultimately, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated the facilities when petroleum and other hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water through underground storage tanks and spills.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aviall notified the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Commission) of the contamination.  The Commission informed Aviall that it was violating state environmental laws, directed Aviall to clean up the site, and threatened to pursue an enforcement action if Aviall failed to undertake remediation.  Neither the Commission nor the EPA, however, took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State\xe2\x80\x99s supervision, beginning in 1984.  Aviall sold the properties to a third party in 1995 and 1996, but remains contractually responsible for the cleanup.  Aviall has incurred approximately $5 million in cleanup costs; the total costs may be even greater.  In August 1997, Aviall filed this action against Cooper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking to recover cleanup costs.  The original complaint asserted a claim for cost recovery under CERCLA \xc2\xa7107(a), a separate claim for contribution under CERCLA \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), and state-law claims.  Aviall later amended the complaint, combining its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint CERCLA claim.  That claim alleged that, pursuant to \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), Aviall was entitled to seek contribution from Cooper, as a PRP under \xc2\xa7107(a), for response costs and other liability Aviall incurred in connection with the Texas facilities.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Aviall continued to assert state-law claims as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  The court held that Aviall, having abandoned its \xc2\xa7107 claim, sought contribution only under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  The court held that \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) relief was unavailable to Aviall because it had not been sued under CERCLA \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107.  Having dismissed Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s federal claim, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  263 F. 3d 134 (2001).  The majority, relying principally on the \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d language in the first sentence of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), held that \xe2\x80\x9ca PRP seeking contribution from other PRPs under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) must have a pending or adjudged \xc2\xa7106 administrative order or \xc2\xa7107(a) cost recovery action against it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 145.  The dissent reasoned that the final sentence of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), the saving clause, clarified that the federal common-law right to contribution survived the enactment of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), even absent a \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) civil action.  <em>Id.,</em> at 148\xe2\x80\x93150 (opinion of Wiener, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit reversed by a divided vote, holding that \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107.  312 F.\xc2\xa03d 677 (2002).  The court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ection 113(f)(1) authorizes suits against PRPs in both its first and last sentence[,] which states without qualification that \xe2\x80\x98nothing\xe2\x80\x99 in the section shall \xe2\x80\x98diminish\xe2\x80\x99 any person\xe2\x80\x99s right to bring a contribution action in the absence of a section 106 or section 107(a) action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 681.

First, as just noted, the natural meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of the enabling clause is that it authorizes certain contribution actions\xe2\x80\x94ones that satisfy the subsequent specified condition\xe2\x80\x94and no others. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and relatedly, if \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) were read to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) civil action, then Congress need not have included the explicit \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d condition.  In other words, Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s reading would render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn,</em> 542 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 10).  Likewise, if \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) authorizes contribution actions at any time, \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement, is equally superfluous.  There is no reason why Congress would bother to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allow contribution actions absent those conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The last sentence of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), the saving clause, does not change our conclusion.  That sentence provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79613(f)(1).  The sole function of the sentence is to clarify that \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) does nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cdiminish\xe2\x80\x9d any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  In other words, the sentence rebuts any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a PRP.  The sentence, however, does not itself establish a cause of action; nor does it expand \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a) civil action; nor does it specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  Reading the saving clause to authorize \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that we must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/30/index.html">503 U. S. 30</a>, 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion follows not simply from \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) itself, but also from the whole of \xc2\xa7113.  As noted above, \xc2\xa7113 provides two express avenues for contribution: \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d specified civil actions) and \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B) (after an administrative or judicially approved settlement that resolves liability to the United States or a State).  Section 113(g)(3) then provides two corresponding 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions, one beginning at the date of judgment, \xc2\xa7113(g)(3)(A), and one beginning at the date of settlement, \xc2\xa7113(g)(3)(B).  Notably absent from \xc2\xa7113(g)(3) is any provision for starting the limitations period if a judgment or settlement never occurs, as is the case with a purely voluntary cleanup.  The lack of such a provision supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under \xc2\xa7113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) or \xc2\xa7113(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each side insists that the purpose of CERCLA bolsters its reading of \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  Given the clear meaning of the text, there is no need to resolve this dispute or to consult the purpose of CERCLA at all.  As we have said: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U. S. 75</a>, 79 (1998).  Section 113(f)(1), 100 Stat. 1647, authorizes contribution claims only \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d a civil action under \xc2\xa7106 or \xc2\xa7107(a), and it is undisputed that Aviall has never been subject to such an action.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] Aviall therefore has no \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) claim.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aviall and <em>amicus</em> Lockheed Martin contend that, in the alternative to an action for contribution under \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), Aviall may recover costs under \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP.  The dissent would have us so hold.  We decline to address the issue.  Neither the District Court, nor the Fifth Circuit panel, nor the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc considered Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7107 claim.  In fact, as noted above, Aviall included separate \xc2\xa7107 and \xc2\xa7113 claims in its original complaint, but then asserted a \xe2\x80\x9ccombined\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7107/\xc2\xa7113 claim in its amended complaint.  The District Court took this consolidated claim to mean that Aviall was relying on \xc2\xa7107 \xe2\x80\x9cnot as an independent cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d but only \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent necessary to maintain a viable \xc2\xa7113(f)(1) contribution claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Civ.

Consequently the court saw no need to address any freestanding \xc2\xa7107 claim.  The Fifth Circuit panel likewise concluded that Aviall no longer advanced a standalone \xc2\xa7107 claim.  263 F. 3d, at 137, n. 2.  The en banc court found it unnecessary to decide whether Aviall had waived the \xc2\xa7107 claim, because it held that Aviall could rely instead on \xc2\xa7113.  312 F. 3d, at 685, n. 15.  Thus, the court did not address the waiver issue, let alone the merits of the \xc2\xa7107 claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mineta, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/534/103/index.html">534 U. S. 103</a>, 109 (2001) <em>(per curiam)</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although we have deviated from this rule in exceptional circumstances, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mendenhall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/544/index.html">446 U. S. 544</a>, 551\xe2\x80\x93552, n. 5 (1980), the circumstances here cut <em>against</em> resolving the \xc2\xa7107 claim.  Both the question whether Aviall has waived this claim and the underlying \xc2\xa7107 question (if it is not waived) may depend in part on the relationship between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107 and 113.  That relationship is a significant issue in its own right.  It is also well beyond the scope of the briefing and, indeed, the question presented, which asks simply whether a private party \xe2\x80\x9cmay bring an action seeking contribution pursuant to CERCLA Section 113(f)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  The \xc2\xa7107 claim and the preliminary waiver question merit full consideration by the courts below.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the parties cite numerous decisions of the Courts of Appeals as holding that a private party that is itself a PRP may not pursue a \xc2\xa7107(a) action against other PRPs for joint and several liability.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bedford Affiliates</em> v. <em>Sills</em>, 156 F. 3d 416, 423\xe2\x80\x93424 (CA2 1998); <em>Centerior Serv.

To hold here that Aviall may pursue a \xc2\xa7107 action, we would have to consider whether these decisions are correct, an issue that Aviall has flagged but not briefed.  And we might have to consider other issues, also not briefed, such as whether Aviall, which seeks to recover the share of its cleanup costs fairly chargeable to Cooper, may pursue a \xc2\xa7107 cost recovery action for some form of liability other than joint and several.  We think it more prudent to withhold judgment on these matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of the importance of the \xc2\xa7107 issue and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, we are not prepared\xe2\x80\x94as the dissent would have it\xe2\x80\x94to resolve the \xc2\xa7107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <em>Key Tronic</em>.  We held there that certain attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees were not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary costs of response\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7107(a)(4)(B).  511 U. S., at 818\xe2\x80\x93821.  But we did not address the relevance, if any, of Key Tronic\xe2\x80\x99s status as a PRP or confront the relationship between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107 and 113.  In discussing \xc2\xa7107, we did not even classify it precisely as a right of cost recovery or a right of contribution, as the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions of the decision reveal.  <em>Post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.)

S. 507</a>, 511 (1925).  Aviall itself recognizes the need for fuller examination of the \xc2\xa7107 claim; it has simply requested that we remand for consideration of that claim, not that we resolve the claim in the first instance. </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to leaving open whether Aviall may seek cost recovery under \xc2\xa7107, Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra,</em> we decline to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under \xc2\xa7107.  Portions of the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion below might be taken to endorse the latter cause of action, 312 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 687; others appear to reserve the question whether such a cause of action exists, <em>id.,</em> at 685, n. 15.  To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its \xc2\xa7107 claim on remand as an implied right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery),[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] we note that this Court has visited the subject of implied rights of contribution before.  See <em>Texas Industries</em>, 451 U. S., at 638\xe2\x80\x93647; <em>Northwest Airlines</em>, 451 U. S., at 90\xe2\x80\x9399.  We also note that, in enacting \xc2\xa7113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \xe2\x80\x9cduring or following\xe2\x80\x9d the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law.  Cf. <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lewis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/11/index.html">444 U. S. 11</a>, 19 (1979).

The majority stated: Section 107 \xe2\x80\x9c<em>implies</em>\xe2\x80\x94but does not expressly <em>command</em>\xe2\x80\x94that [a PRP] may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 U. S., at 818, and n.\xc2\xa011 ((emphasis added)).  The dissent maintained: \xe2\x80\x9cSection 107(a)(4)(B) states, as clearly as can be, that \xe2\x80\x98[c]overed persons \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be liable for\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.\xe2\x80\x99  Surely to say that A shall be liable to B is the <em>express</em> creation of a right of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 822.  But no Justice expressed the slightest doubt that \xc2\xa7107 indeed did enable a PRP to sue other covered persons for reimbursement, in whole or part, of cleanup costs the PRP legitimately \nincurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its original complaint, Aviall identified \xc2\xa7107 as the federal-law basis for an independent cost-recovery claim against Cooper, and \xc2\xa7113 as the basis for a contribution claim.  App. 8A, 16A\xe2\x80\x9317A.  In amended pleadings, Aviall alleged both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7107 and 113 as the federal underpinning for its contribution claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 27A, 48A.  Aviall\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7113 and 107 in tandem to assert a contribution claim conformed its pleading to then-governing Fifth Circuit precedent, which held that a CERCLA contribution action arises through the joint operation of \xc2\xa7107(a) and \xc2\xa7113(f)(1).  See <em>Geraghty and Miller, Inc.</em> v. <em>Conoco, Inc.</em>, 234 F.\xc2\xa03d 917, 924 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile section 113(f) is the vehicle for bringing a contribution action, it does not create a new cause of action or create any new liabilities.  Rather, it is a mechanism for apportioning costs that are recoverable under section 107.\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  A party obliged by circuit precedent to plead in a certain way can hardly be deemed to have waived a plea the party could have maintained had the law of the Circuit permitted him to do so.

See Response of Appellant Aviall Services, Inc., to the <em>Amicus Curiae</em> Brief of the United States in No. 00\xe2\x80\x9310197 (CA5), p. 24 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]arties who are excluded from seeking contribution under section 113(f)(1) must therefore have available to them the broader right of cost recovery [covering both full recovery and contribution] under section 107(a).\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Key Tronic</em>, 511 U.

S., at 816).  Accordingly, I would not defer a definitive ruling by this Court on the question whether Aviall may pursue a \xc2\xa7107 claim for relief against Cooper.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Key Tronic, a PRP, asserted a cost-recovery claim under \xc2\xa7107(a) to recoup approximately $1.2 million in costs that it allegedly incurred cleaning up its site \xe2\x80\x9cat its own initiative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Key Tronic Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 984 F.\xc2\xa02d 1025, 1026 (CA9 1993).  Although Key Tronic settled a portion of its liability with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the claim advanced in Key Tronic\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7107(a) suit rested on remedial action taken before the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, remediation that did not figure in the settlement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1026\xe2\x80\x931027; <em>Key Tronic Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/809/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/809/index.html">511 U.
