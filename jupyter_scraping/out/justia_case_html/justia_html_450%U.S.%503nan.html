The customary delay from the time of payment until the receipt of refund upon successful protest is two years, and the refund is not accompanied by a payment of interest.  The beneficial owner of an apartment building in Cook County, Ill., challenged the tax assessment of her property for a certain tax year, but, after an unsuccessful administrative appeal, refused to pay the taxes and instead brought an action in Federal District Court for injunctive relief against petitioners (the Treasurer and Assessor of Cook County), alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that, by requiring her to pay taxes in excess of the lawful amount, they deprived her of equal protection and due process secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction pursuant to the Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits federal district courts from enjoining the assessment, levy, or collection of state taxes where "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."

In particular, she cited a study of the Illinois Department of Local Government Affairs showing that, for 1975, property in the same class as respondent\'s was assessed as low as 3% and as high as 973% of fair market value.  She furthermore alleged that such disparities in assessments were "far greater in number and size in older, inner city and county areas, owned, inhabited or used to a larger extent by minorities and poorer people."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Finally, she contended that the Assessor knew that she had previously challenged the 1974, 1975, and 1976 assessments of her property.

Our task is to determine whether the Illinois refund procedure constitutes "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy . . . in the courts of such State" within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341, thereby barring federal jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief.

The Tax Injunction Act generally prohibits federal district courts from enjoining state tax administration except in instances where the state court remedy is not "plain, speedy and efficient."  On its face, the "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" exception appears to require a state court remedy that meets certain minimal procedural criteria.  The Court has only occasionally sought to define the meaning of the exception since passage of the Act in 1937.  When it has done so, however the Court has emphasized a procedural interpretation in defining both the entire phrase and its individual word components.</p>\n<p>Discussing the general meaning of the phrase, the Court, in <em>Tully v. Griffin, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html">429 U. S. 68</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#74">429 U.

This affords an adequate remedy to the taxpayer, and at the same time leaves undisturbed the state\'s administration of its taxes."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  <em>See Hillsborough v. Cromwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/620/case.html">326 U.

S. 625</a></span> (1946) (issue is "whether the State affords full protection to the federal rights").</p>\n<p>What little can be gleaned from the legislative history of the Act on the phrase "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" lends further support to a procedural interpretation.  Senator Bone, the Act\'s primary sponsor, referred to the "plain, speedy and efficient remedy" provision and then stated:  "Thus, a full hearing and judicial determination of the controversy is assured."  81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937).  The Senate Report accompanying the Act mirrors Senator Bone\'s understanding, adding that "[a]n appeal to the Supreme Court of the United State is available, as in other cases."  S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).</p>\n<p>The phrase "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy" in the Tax Injunction Act was "modeled" after verbatim language </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 450 U. S. 514</a></p><p> in the Johnson Act, of 1934, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] an Act prohibiting federal court interference with orders issued by state administrative agencies to public utilities.  As Senator Bone made clear, "[m]ost of the arguments which were used in support of the Johnson Act . . . apply in like manner" to the Tax Injunction Act.  81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937).  Our examination of the Johnson Act and its legislative history reveals the same procedural emphasis as found in the Tax Injunction Act and its legislative history.  As gloss on the words "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy," the Senate Report on the Johnson Act spoke of state laws that provided for an appeal from the determination of the state agency by any dissatisfied party.  S.Rep. No. 701, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1932).  The Senate Report continued:</p>\n<p>"This appeal is taken to the courts of the State, thus giving to both sides of any controversy which may arise <em>a full hearing and judicial determination of the controversy.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the Illinois state court refund procedure provides the taxpayer with a "full hearing and judicial determination" at which she may raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax.  <em>LaSalle National Bank v. County of Cook,</em> 57 Ill.2d 318, 324, 312 N.E.2d 252, 255-256 (1974).  Appeal to the higher Illinois courts is authorized, Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 120, \xc2\xa7 675 (1977), and review is ultimately available in this Court, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257.  Respondent does not allege any procedural defect in the Illinois remedy, other than delay, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] that would preclude preservation and consideration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 450 U. S. 515</a></p><p> of her federal rights, since she is free to raise her equal protection and due process federal constitutional objections during the Application for Judgment proceedings before the Circuit Court of Cook County. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Rather, respondent\'s argument -- that Illinois\' failure to pay interest on the tax refund makes the remedy not "plain, speedy and efficient" -- appears to address a more substantive concern.  Whether she has any "federal right" to receive interest -- a right she has not asserted and on which we express no view -- it would appear that she could assert this right in the state court proceeding.  The procedural mechanism for correction of her tax bill remains the same, however, whether interest is paid or not. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 450 U. S. 516</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>A <em>procedural</em> interpretation of the phrase "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy," and the <em>procedural</em> sufficiency of Illinois\' remedy, are supported further by analysis of the phrase\'s individual words.  According to the 1934 edition of Webster\'s New International Dictionary, <em>plain</em> means "clear" or "manifest," <em>speedy</em> means "quick," <em>efficient</em> means "characterized by effective activity," and a <em>remedy</em> is the "legal means to recover a right . . . or obtain redress for . . . a wrong."  Webster\'s New International Dictionary of the English Language 819, 1878, 2106, 2418 (2d ed.1934). [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>While the Court has never addressed the meaning of the word "speedy," it has interpreted the words "plain" and "efficient."  Thus, the Court suggested that "uncertainty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 450 U. S. 517</a></p><p> concerning a State\'s remedy may make it less than <em>plain\' under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1341."  <em>Tully v. Griffin, Inc.,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#76">429 U. S. 76</a></span>.  Earlier cases, without making a direct connection to the word "plain," have held that "uncertainty" surrounding a state court remedy lifts the bar to federal court jurisdiction.  <em>Hillsborough v. Cromwell,</em> 326 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/620/case.html#625">326 U. S. 625</a></span>-626. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Respondent has made no argument that the Illinois refund procedure is uncertain or otherwise unclear.  There is no question that, under the Illinois procedure, the court will hear and decide any federal claim.  Paying interest or eliminating delay would not make the remedy any more "plain."\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court\'s interpretation of the word "efficient" has also stressed procedural elements.  In <em>Tully,</em> the Court commented that</p>\n<p>"a State\'s remedy does not become \'inefficient\' merely because a taxpayer must travel across a state line in order to resist or challenge the taxes sought to be imposed."</p>\n<p>429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#73">429 U. S. 73</a></span>.  In addition, without explicitly mentioning the word "efficient," we have permitted federal court jurisdiction when the taxpayer\'s state court remedy would require a multiplicity of suits, <em>Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v. Redwine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/299/case.html">342 U.

Because the Illinois remedy imposes no unusual hardship on respondent requiring ineffectual activity or an unnecessary expenditure of time or energy, we cannot say that it is not "efficient." [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court has never expressly discussed the meaning of the word "speedy," an issue that is squarely presented in this case.  We must decide whether Illinois\' refund after two years qualifies as a "speedy" remedy.  "Speedy" is perforce a relative concept, and we must assess the 2-year delay against the usual time for similar litigation.  It surely is no secret that state and federal trial courts have been beset by docket congestion and delay for many years. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Whether </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 450 U. S. 519</a></p><p> this is a necessary, let alone a reasonable, condition of 20th-century litigation is beside the point:  the fact of the matter is that legal conflicts are not resolved as quickly a we would like.</p>\n<p>In 1976, the median number of days from filing a complaint to disposition of a civil trial matter in 13 urban trial courts ranged from 357 to 980.  National Center for State Courts, Justice Delayed 10-11 (1978). [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  In 7 of the 13, over 30% of the civil cases took more than two years from start to finish.  <em>Id.</em> at 13.  The Cook County Circuit Court had a similar record:  from 1974 to 1975, the average time from date of filing to verdict was about 40 months.  U.S. Department of Justice State Court Caseload Statistics:  The State of the Art 7 (1978).  Federal district courts have not fared much better.  As of 1980, the median time interval from filing to disposition for civil cases going to trial was 20 months; 10% of those took </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 450 U. S. 520</a></p><p> more than 46 months.  Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 81, A-30 (1980).  For the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the District in which respondent brought this suit, the median time interval was 23 months, with 10 of all cases over 53 months.  <em>Id.</em> at A-31. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Cast in this light, respondent\'s 2-year wait, regrettably, is not unusual.  Nowhere in the Tax Injunction Act did Congress suggest that the remedy must be the speediest. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 450 U. S. 521</a></p><p> payment of interest might make the wait more tolerable, but it would not affect the amount of time necessary to adjudicate respondent\'s federal claims.  Limiting ourselves to the circumstances of the instant case, we cannot say that respondent\'s 2-year delay falls outside the boundary of a "speedy" remedy. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 450 U. S. 522</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The overall purpose of the Tax Injunction Act is consistent with the view that the "plain, speedy an efficient remedy" exception to the Act\'s prohibition was only designed to require that the state remedy satisfy certain procedural criteria, and that Illinois\' refund procedure meets such criteria.  The statute "has its roots in equity practice, in principles of federalism, and in recognition of the imperative need of a State to administer its own fiscal operations."  <em>Tully v. Griffin, Inc.,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#73">429 U. S. 73</a></span>. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  This last consideration was the principal motivating force behind the Act:  this legislation was first and foremost a vehicle to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.  81 Cong.Rec. 1415 (1937) (remarks of Sen. Bone); <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman,</em> 319 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/293/case.html#301">319 U.

S. 523</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When it passed the Act, Congress knew that state tax systems commonly provided for payment of taxes under protest with subsequent refund as their exclusive remedy.  The Senate Report to the Act noted:</p>\n<p>"It is the common practice for statutes of the various States to forbid actions in State courts to enjoin the collection of State and county taxes unless the tax law is invalid or the property is exempt from taxation, and these statutes generally provide that taxpayers may contest their taxes only in refund actions after payment under protest.  This type of State legislation makes it possible for the States and their various agencies to survive while long, drawn-out tax litigation is in progress."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937).  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1503, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).  <em>See also Matthews v. Rodgers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/521/case.html">284 U.

S. 526</a></span> (1932).</p>\n<p>It is only common sense to presume that Congress was also aware that some of these same States did not pay interest on their refunds to taxpayers, following the then-familiar rule that interest in refund actions was recoverable only when expressly allowed by statute.  3 T. Cooley, Law of Taxation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 450 U. S. 524</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 1308, pp. 2596-2597 (4th ed.1924). [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  It would be wholly unreasonable, therefore, to construe a statute passed to limit federal court interference in state tax matters to mean that Congress nevertheless wanted taxpayers from States not paying interest on refunds to have unimpaired access to the federal courts.  If Congress had meant to carve out such an expansive exception, one would expect to find some mention of it.  The statute\'s broad prophylactic language is incompatible with such an interpretation.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>For the most part, respondent rests her case on the persuasiveness of a syllogism:  the Tax Injunction Act is coterminous with pre-1937 federal equity treatment of challenges to state taxes; federal equity practice at that time viewed a no-interest refund remedy as inadequate; [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] therefore, it must follow that the Tax Injunction Act would view a nointerest refund remedy as inadequate, thereby authorizing federal jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondent 21.  This argument </p><p><a class="page-number" name="525">Page 450 U. S. 525</a></p><p> also forms part of the basis for the Court of Appeals\' decision.  604 F.2d at 533, n. 4.  And even petitioners, Brief for Petitioners 40, suggest that the Tax Injunction Act is "a congressional confirmation of the Court\'s prior federal equity practice in the area of state and local taxation." [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded.  It is true that post-1937 Court cases have suggested that the Tax Injunction Act recognized and sanctioned preexisting federal equity practice.  <em>See Moe v. Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U. S. 463</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html#470">425 U. S. 470</a></span> (1976); <em>Hillsborough v.

But these cases do no more than confirm that "the statute has its roots in equity practice," <em>Tully v. Griffin, Inc.,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#73">429 U. S. 73</a></span>, and that it was a longstanding rule of federal equity to keep out of state tax matters as long as a "plain, adequate and complete remedy" could be had at law.  <em>Hillsborough v.

Nothing in our decisions suggests that every wrinkle of federal equity practice was codified, intact, by Congress.

S. 526</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Indeed, Congress, among other things, legislated to solve an existing problem by <em>cutting back</em> federal equity jurisdiction.  Senator Bone commented that the</p>\n<p>"<em>existing</em> practice of the Federal courts to entertain tax injunction suits make[s] it possible for foreign corporations to withhold from a State and its governmental subdivisions taxes in such vast amounts and for such long periods as to disrupt State and county finances, and thus make it possible for such corporations to determine for themselves the amount of taxes they will pay."</p>\n<p>81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937) (emphasis added).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).  He furthermore noted that "[p]rovision is made that the bill is not to affect suits pending at the time of its enactment."  81 Cong.Rec. at 1415.  Thus, Congress plainly did not intend to permit the federal courts, after passage of the Tax Injunction Act, to entertain suits in all cases cognizable by them prior to the Act. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Congress did not equate \xc2\xa7 1341\'s "plain, speedy and efficient" with equity\'s "plain, adequate and complete."  Ever since the early days of Congress, this "plain, adequate and complete" standard of federal equity practice had been codified into statutory form.  1 Stat. 82. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  And it was not until 1948, more than 10 years after passage of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 450 U. S. 527</a></p><p> Tax Injunction Act, that the "Suits in Equity" statute was repealed.  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 384 (1946 ed.) (repealed June 25, 1948).  Against this background, we will not interpret the Tax Injunction Act as substantially redundant of \xc2\xa7 384.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Finally, we note that the reasons supporting federal noninterference are just as compelling today as they were in 1937.  If federal injunctive relief were available,</p>\n<p>"state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.  During the pendency of the federal suit, the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State\'s budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.  Moreover, federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts."</p>\n<p><em>Perez v. Ledesma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html">401 U. S. 82</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/case.html#128">401 U. S. 128</a></span>, n. 17 (1971) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>The compelling nature of these considerations is underscored by the dependency of state budgets on the receipt of local tax revenues.  In 1978, States derived over 61% of their revenue from property, sales, income, and other taxes.  Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Significant Features of Fiscal Federalism 53, 56 (1980).  For Illinois, the percentage was even higher -- 67.4%.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The property tax is by far the most important source of tax revenue for cities and counties.  For the year 1977-1978, almost 33% of all their income nationwide came from the local property tax; for Illinois\' local governments, the amount was greater -- 39.2%.  <em>Id.</em> at 78.</p>\n<p>The experience of Cook County itself demonstrates how ominous would be the potential for havoc should federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 450 U.

During the same year, the number of complaints filed with the Cook County Board of Appeals totaled 22,262.  <em>Id.</em> at 31, n. 61.  We may readily appreciate the difficulties encountered by the county should a substantial portion of its rightful tax revenue be tied up in injunction actions. [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  If each of these complaints alleged entitlement to a refund of around $5,000, as does respondent, over $113 million in revenues potentially could be encumbered in federal court litigation.  <em>See also</em> City of New York, Annual Report of the Tax Commission for Fiscal Year 1978-1979, p. 14 (1979) (41,449 applications for correction of taxes owed concerning 48,170 parcels of land, of which 40,793 applications concerning 47,512 parcels of land involved hearings).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we hold that Illinois\' legal remedy that provides property owners paying property taxes under protest a refund without interest in two years is "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy" under the Tax Injunction Act.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court expressly did not decide whether omission to provide interest on a successful refund application rendered a state remedy not "plain, speedy and efficient," in <em>Department of Employment v.

Moreover, the level of assessment of the highest class cannot exceed 2 1/2 times the level of assessment of the lowest class in the county.  Under authority of the Illinois Constitution, Art.

Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 120 \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 675, 716 (1977).  <em>See Clarendon Associates v. Korzen,</em> 56 Ill.2d 101, 104, 306 N.E.2d 299, 301 (1973).  The tax is due in two installments.  Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 120, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 705, 705.1 (1977).  The taxpayer must file a written protest along with the second installment payment setting forth grounds for the objection to the tax.  \xc2\xa7 675.  Then, the Collector of Cook County publishes an advertisement giving notice and stating the date of his intended application to the Circuit Court of Cook County for judgment fixing the correct amount of any tax paid under protest.  \xc2\xa7 706.  Although the month of October is the apparent target date for applying for judgment, \xc2\xa7 710, respondent contends that the Cook County Collector\'s applications are not made until late November or early December, Brief for Respondent 14, n. 14.  The Collector at the same time applies to the Circuit Court for judgment for sale of delinquent lands and lots whose owners have failed to pay their property tax bills.  \xc2\xa7 706.</p>\n<p>Once the Collector\'s Application for Judgment is filed with the Circuit Court, the taxpayer must file a written objection to the application within a period of time specified by the judge, stating his reasons for challenging the tax.

After the filing of the objection, the court must hold a settlement conference between the two sides within 90 days.  Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 120, \xc2\xa7 675a (1977).  If no settlement is reached, the court must, upon demand of either party, set the matter for hearing within 90 days of the conference, and decide the case.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 675a, 716.  Finally, the court enters judgment and orders a refund for any or all of the tax erroneously paid by the taxpayer.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 675, 716.  The dissatisfied taxpayer may appeal any such judgment to the higher courts of Illinois.  \xc2\xa7 675.</p>\n<p>Illinois courts grant equitable relief by way of injunction against collection of property taxes only when the tax is unauthorized by law or when the tax is levied on exempt properties, <em>LaSalle National Bank v.

This results in part from an observed correlation between population and calendar congestion.  Institute of Judicial Administration, Calendar Status, in Proceedings of the Attorney General\'s Conference on Court Congestion and Delay in Litigation 196 (1958).  For example, in 1958, the average time from the beginning of suit until the commencement of jury trial was 18.8 months for counties with populations over 750,000, 11.4 month for counties between 500,000 and 750,000, and 5.6 months for counties under 500,000.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>Current statistics are only the latest in a long history of delay and congestion in federal and state courts.

Leaving aside the issue whether the phrase "demonstrably unjust" describes the proper inquiry, these four factors boil down to the same two elements of delay and failure to pay interest addressed in this Court\'s opinion.

The second -- that overassessment continues "notwithstanding [the taxpayer\'s] formal protests and the manifest error in the original assessment," <em>ibid.</em> -- would appear to require error-free administration that even the best procedures could not guarantee.  Indeed, absent a judicial determination of the correct assessment, it is not surprising that respondent\'s "formal protests" failed to persuade the Assessor and Board of Appeals of their "manifest error."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22, <em>supra.</em>  Here, respondent\'s challenges to the three tax years were resolved within two years in a single court proceeding.

S. 281</a></span> (1960).  But Congress surely did not intend that the threat of federal injunctive relief be used as a lever to force States to appropriate funds for interest payable to their taxpayers.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court\'s opinion, but I must confess that, in doing so, I participate in the decision with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.  I am aware of just how frustrating it can be for a conscientious property taxpayer who encounters what appears </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 450 U. S. 529</a></p><p> to him to be unfairness, arbitrariness, delay, and an inadequacy of redress even though he might ultimately prevail on his basic contentions about existing property tax assessment and collection methods.  Nearly every municipality encounters like criticism.  JUSTICE STEVENS\' dissent, however, indicates that Cook County\'s system surely is not one of the better ones.</p>\n<p>But the Tax Injunction Act was passed for a specific purpose, and I very much doubt that the cure, although it may provide a headache, is worse than the disease.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion demonstrates, I think, that the remedy provided by Illinois law qualifies, though perhaps only barely, as "plain, speedy and efficient" within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act, and that federal jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief is therefore statutorily barred.  Illinois -- and particularly Cook County -- may have little reason to be proud of the system, but it seems to pass muster under the Act.  One might well hope, even though forlornly, that that system and its administration will be improved so that uncomfortable and distressing litigation like this case need not be pursued.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE STEWART, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In its discussion of the jurisdictional question presented by this case, the Court correctly assumes that the administration of Cook County\'s system of taxing real property has violated respondent\'s federal constitutional rights.  The question is whether she must be denied equitable relief in a federal court because Illinois affords her "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy."</p>\n<p>Year after year, Cook County requires respondent to pay a tax that is three times as great as the amount actually due, and then, after a 2-year delay, the county refunds the overassessment without interest.  Because the outcome of this annual ritual is predictable, the taxpayer\'s remedy is "plain" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 450 U. S. 530</a></p><p> and because only about 705 of the Nation\'s litigation is processed more rapidly, the remedy is also "speedy and efficient."  That is the consequence of the Court\'s view that Congress was concerned with nothing more than "minimal procedural criteria" when it enacted the Tax Injunction Act. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In my view, the substance of the State\'s remedy must also be considered.  If the substance of the remedy is irrelevant, a computerized calculation accompanied by a preprinted rejection slip would qualify as a "plain, speedy and efficient remedy."  Because I am persuaded that a reading of the federal statute that would lead to such an absurd result is manifestly incorrect, and because the Illinois refund remedy cannot fairly be characterized as adequate, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>If one reads the 1937 Act against its historical background, the conclusion is inescapable that Congress did not intend an inadequate state remedy to oust a federal court of jurisdiction over a taxpayer\'s constitutional claim.  This Court has often recognized that the statute has its roots in preexisting equity practice.  <em>Moe v.

In 1932, the Court, while recognizing the force of this rule of equity in suits to enjoin the collection of state taxes, nevertheless indicated the importance of the substance of the state remedy:</p>\n<p>"The effect of [Section 16 of the Judiciary Act of 1789], which was but declaratory of the rule in equity, established long before its adoption, is to emphasize the rule and to forbid in terms recourse to the extraordinary remedies of equity <em>where the right asserted may be fully protected at law.</em> <em>See Deweese v.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act does not support the notion that Congress intended the Act to alter the standard by eliminating consideration of the substance of the state remedy.  The principal sponsor of the Act, Senator Bone, indicated that the statute assured "a full hearing and judicial determination of the controversy."  81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937).  <em>See also</em> S.Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1937) (hereinafter 1937 Senate Report).  The terms "full hearing" and "judicial determination" surely imply that the remedy may not be an empty ritual.  Indeed, Senator Bone emphasized that "the bill does not take away any equitable right of a taxpayer, or deprive him of a day in court."  81 Cong.Rec. 1416 (1937).  <em>See also</em> 1937 Senate Report at 2. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The legislative history does not justify the Court\'s miserly reading of the statute. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 450 U. S. 533</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The conclusion that the substance of the state remedy must be considered does not rest on the premise that Congress codified intact every "wrinkle" of federal equity practice.  Clearly, Congress intended the Tax Injunction Act to restrict the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts.  Specifically Congress wanted to eliminate the abuse of diversity jurisdiction by foreign corporations which were able to frustrate the state taxing process by obtaining injunctions in federal court. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Moreover, as the Court recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/case.html#522">450 U. S. 522</a></span>, n. 28, the Act was a response to what was perceived as an unwarranted expansion of federal jurisdiction in suits to enjoin state officers that had developed in the wake of <em>Ex parte Young,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a></span> (1908). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  The Tax Injunction Act shifted the focus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 450 U. S. 534</a></p><p> of the federal courts from a determination of whether the complainant had an adequate remedy at law to a consideration of whether he had a sufficient remedy -- either in equity or at law -- in the state courts. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Although Congress thus gave important protection to state tax administration by cutting back federal equity jurisdiction, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended the expansion of the types of remedies that defeat federal jurisdiction to be accompanied by a drastic relaxation of the scrutiny given to those remedies. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  If Congress did intend such a relaxation, the Tax Injunction Act\'s roots in equity are shallow indeed.</p>\n<p>This Court has consistently employed the equity adequacy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 450 U. S. 535</a></p><p> standard in construing the Tax Injunction Act.  In 1944 -- only seven years after the Act was passed -- the Court stated that the District Court had jurisdiction because of "the uncertainty surrounding the adequacy of the Connecticut remedy."  <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/101/case.html">323 U. S. 101</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/101/case.html#105">323 U. S. 105</a></span>-106.  In 1946, in <em>Hillsborough v. Cromwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/620/case.html">326 U. S. 620</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/620/case.html#625">326 U. S. 625</a></span>, the Court held that "uncertainty" as to whether the state remedy "affords full protection to the federal rights" was sufficient to demonstrate that the remedy was not adequate. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  And recently, in <em>Tully v. Griffin, Inc.,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/case.html#74">429 U. S. 74</a></span>, the Court indicated that, to be sufficient under the statute, the remedy must permit the taxpayer "to press its constitutional claims while preserving the right to challenge the amount of the tax due." [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Thus, our cases support the theory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 450 U. S. 536</a></p><p> that Congress, rather than making an unexplained and drastic change in the traditional equity standard as to adequacy, assumed that the prior standard would apply. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>This interpretation of the Tax Injunction Act and its history is consistent with the purposes of the Act.  By including the "plain, speedy and efficient" exception to the statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 450 U. S. 537</a></p><p> prohibition of federal equity jurisdiction, Congress indicated its clear intent to preserve federal court jurisdiction unless some state remedy existed.  If the federal courts are limited by the Tax Injunction Act to a consideration of the procedural mechanics of the state remedy, and are forbidden to consider the substance of such a remedy, then a state remedy which could not possibly afford any relief or which had the potential for only nominal relief would defeat federal jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  This "form over substance" interpretation renders the exception contained in the Act meaningless, because there would be little purpose in denying a federal remedy to a litigant and sending him to state court to pursue a state remedy -- albeit a quick and certain one -- that provided no relief. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  A futile state remedy is not significantly different from no remedy at all.  Similarly, an inadequate state remedy is not analytically different from a state procedure that provides a remedy as to only a portion of the litigant\'s claims.  Such an incomplete remedy will not defeat federal jurisdiction.  <em>Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v. Redwine,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/299/case.html">342 U.

[<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Therefore, in my view, if the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 450 U. S. 538</a></p><p> state remedy does not provide adequate protection to the federal right, a federal remedy continues to be available. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The inadequacy of the Illinois procedure is much more than a mere failure to pay interest on overassessments.  If we take the allegations of the complaint as true, as we must, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 450 U. S. 539</a></p><p> it is apparent that four factors combine to make the Illinois remedial scheme demonstrably unjust.</p>\n<p>First, the tax assessments themselves reveal gross inequities.  Not only was respondent\'s property admittedly assessed at 3 times its proper assessment value, but other properties in the same class have been assessed at widely divergent rates, ranging from a tiny fraction of actual value to amounts approximately 10 times the true worth. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  The county\'s practices apparently give the tax assessor a license to engage in arbitrary and invidious discrimination.</p>\n<p>Second, because the overassessment of respondent\'s property was repeated year after year, notwithstanding her formal protests and the manifest error in the original assessment, it is apparent that the county\'s procedures do not adequately avoid the risk of repetitive error. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  The case might well be different if it revealed an isolated mistake affecting only one </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 450 U. S. 540</a></p><p> tax year:  but an evaluation of the State\'s remedy must involve consideration not only of the fairness of the refund procedure, but also of the taxpayer\'s ability to prevent the same mistake from being made year after year. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, although the 2-year period which the county requires to process a refund claim might well be tolerable if its remedy were adequate in all other respects, that time period aggravates each of the other shortcomings. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Indeed, like the fourth factor -- the failure to pay interest -- it actually provides the county with an incentive to make overassessments, because the county has the cost-free use of the taxpayer\'s money while her claim is being processed.</p>\n<p>Finally, the failure to pay any interest at all, in combination with the foregoing factors, makes it a virtual certainty that the taxpayer\'s ultimate recovery will be worth only a fraction of the actual harm caused by the county\'s wrong.  Cases decided prior to the Tax Injunction Act indicated that state remedies which did not provide for the payment of interest were not sufficient to defeat federal equity jurisdiction.  <em>See Educational Films Corp. v.

[<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Few remedies fully compensate the victim of official wrongdoing, but surely one would not characterize a remedy that could never exceed one-half or two-thirds of the amount taken as a complete and adequate remedy.  Yet if a county may collect 3 to 10 times the amount of tax that a citizen owes and use the excess for two years without paying any interest, the value of that which is ultimately returned is not complete or adequate compensation for the value of what was unjustly taken.

When no interest is paid -- or when the rate of interest on judgments is significantly lower than the prevailing market rate -- the law rewards the dilatory defendant who can postpone the ultimate day of reckoning for as long as possible.  The same powerful market forces are at work when a public body is the defendant.  Whether or not one agrees with the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the payment of interest is an essential ingredient of any adequate refund remedy, it seems perfectly clear that, given the factors disclosed by this record, the remedy afforded by Illinois is indeed inadequate.

Black\'s Law Dictionary 1163 (5th ed.1979) defines "remedy" as "[t]he means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated."  A court cannot insure that the federal rights are "enforced," or the violation of such rights "prevented, redressed, or compensated," without a consideration of the substance of the state remedy.  Moreover, the word "efficient," which was defined as "characterized by effective activity," may have been intended to require an effective remedy.  <em>See</em> Webster\'s New International Dictionary of the English Language 819 (2d ed.1934).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The 1937 Senate Report at 1-2, stated:</p>\n<p>"If those to whom the Federal courts are open may secure injunctive relief against the collection of taxes, the highly unfair picture is presented of the citizen of the State being required to pay first and then litigate, while those privileged to sue in the Federal courts need only pay what they choose and withhold the balance during the period of litigation."</p>\n<p>"The existing practice of the Federal courts in entertaining tax injunction suits against State officers makes it possible for foreign corporations doing business in such States to withhold from them and their governmental subdivisions taxes in such vast amounts and for such long periods of time as to seriously disrupt State and county finances.  The pressing-needs of these States for this tax money is so great that, in many instances, they have been compelled to compromise these suits, as a result of which substantial portions of the tax have been lost to the States without a judicial examination into the real merits of the controversy."</p>\n<p>The Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1342, upon which the Tax Injunction Act was modeled, and its legislative history reflect the same concern.
