Fox\xe2\x80\x99s suit asserted both state-law claims, including defamation,<em> </em>and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, including interference with Fox\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek public office.  Vice removed the case to federal court based on the \xc2\xa71983 claims.  After discovery, he sought summary judgment on the federal claims, which Fox conceded were not valid.  The District Court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims to state court, noting that Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 work could be useful in the state-court proceedings.  Vice then asked the federal court for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71988, submitting attorney billing records estimating the time spent on the entire suit, without differentiating between time spent on the now-dismissed federal claims and on the remaining state claims.  The court granted the motion on the ground that Fox\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims were frivolous, awarding Fox fees for all work his attorneys had performed in the suit.  Although the state-law allegations had not been found frivolous, the court did not require Vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets of claims.  It also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the surviving state-law claims, noting that both sides had focused on the frivolous \xc2\xa71983 claims.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Fox\xe2\x80\x99s argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defendant to recover any fees, and agreeing with the District Court that the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0When a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims.

While most of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71988 decisions have concerned fees to prevailing plaintiffs, \xc2\xa71988 also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant \xe2\x80\x9cupon a finding that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Christiansburg Garment Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/412/index.html">434 U. S. 412</a>, 421.  Just as plaintiffs may receive fees under \xc2\xa71988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed for costs under \xc2\xa71988 even if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not wholly frivolous, <em>ibid., </em>n.\xc2\xa010.  The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from these non-frivolous charges, see <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U. S., at 420\xe2\x80\x93421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in enacting \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x94to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation\xe2\x80\x94points to the proper standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; <em>i.e., </em>\xc2\xa71988 permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim.  A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defendants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely because the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit also included frivolous claims.  This \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work because of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s greater financial exposure on that claim.  The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous allegation.  The answers to those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge, it is the second one that matters.  The determination of fees \xe2\x80\x9cshould not result in a second major litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley</em>, 461 U. S., at 437.  The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.  The trial court has wide discretion, but must apply the correct but-for standard.  And the appeals court must determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for question, rather than some other.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to Vice.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suggests that Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous claims.  The charges arose out of Vice\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to the non-frivolous state-law claims, his \xe2\x80\x9cdefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  It thus seems likely that Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have, <em>e.g.,</em> taken many of the same depositions.  Although the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 work in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper account of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Its reasoning\xe2\x80\x94that the close relationship between the federal and state-law claims supported the award\xe2\x80\x94cannot be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of frivolous<em> </em>litigation.  Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on the proper ground.  It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers would have done that work regardless.  On this record, the case must be returned to the lower courts.

See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988.  We have held that a defendant may receive such an award if the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit is frivolous.  In this case, the plaintiff asserted both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  We hold today that a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant in this circumstance, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims.  A trial court has wide discretion in applying this standard.  But here we must vacate the judgment below because the court used a different and incorrect standard in awarding fees.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case arises out of an election for chief of police in the town of Vinton, Louisiana.  The candidates were petitioner Ricky Fox (the challenger) and respondent Billy Ray Vice (the incumbent).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  By Fox\xe2\x80\x99s account, Vice resorted to an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force Fox out of the race.  In particular, Vice sent an anonymous letter to Fox threatening to publish damaging charges against him if he remained a candidate.  Vice also arranged for a third party to publicly accuse Fox of using racial slurs and then to file a criminal complaint against Fox repeating those allegations.  And when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint, Vice leaked it to the press.  Yet all of these machinations failed; Fox won the election.  And Vice got an even greater comeuppance: He was subsequently convicted of criminal extortion for his election-related conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fox, however, chose not to let the matter rest; he filed this suit in Louisiana state court against Vice and the town of Vinton, also a respondent here.  Fox\xe2\x80\x99s complaint asserted both state-law claims, including defamation,<em> </em>and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, including interference with his right to seek public office.  Vice and the town (Vice, for short) removed the case to federal court on the basis of the \xc2\xa71983 claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the end of discovery in the suit, Vice moved for summary judgment on Fox\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims.  Fox conceded that the claims were \xe2\x80\x9cno[t] valid,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 169, and the District Court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice.  In the same ruling, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.  Docket No. 2:06\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93135 (WD La., Oct. 16, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a\xe2\x80\x9340a.  The court instead remanded the now slimmed-down case to state court for adjudication.  In doing so, the District Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny trial preparation, legal research, and discovery may be used by the parties in the state court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 40a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vice then asked the federal court for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa71988, arguing that Fox\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims were \xe2\x80\x9cbaseless and without merit.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 198.  Vice stated that his lawyers had had to participate in five lengthy depositions and review numerous records to defend against Fox\xe2\x80\x99s charges.  <em>Id.,</em> at 199.  In support of his fee request, Vice submitted attorney billing records estimating the time spent on the whole suit, without differentiating between the federal and state-law claims.  See Supp. App. 8\xe2\x80\x9367.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees on the ground that Fox\xe2\x80\x99s federal claims were frivolous.  Although the state-law allegations had not been found frivolous (and indeed remained live), the court did not require Vice to separate out the work his attorneys had done on the two sets of claims.  Docket No. 2:06\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x93135 (WD La., Sept. 22, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.  According to the court, such \xe2\x80\x9csegregation\xe2\x80\x9d was unnecessary because the \xe2\x80\x9cvarious claims arose out of the same transaction and were so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, the court declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the surviving state-law claims.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hroughout the litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, both sides \xe2\x80\x9cfocus[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d on Fox\xe2\x80\x99s frivolous \xc2\xa71983 claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 32a\xe2\x80\x9333a.  The court therefore concluded that Vice should receive all of the fees he reasonably incurred in defending the suit\xe2\x80\x94a total of $48,681.  <em>Id.,</em> at 34a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.  594 F.\xc2\xa03d 423 (CA5 2010).  The majority first rejected Fox\xe2\x80\x99s contention that all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defendant to recover any fees.  That rule, the court explained, would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims without consequenc[e]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d so long as they added a single non-frivolous claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 428 (quoting <em>Tutor-Saliba Corp. </em>v. <em>Hailey, </em>452 F.\xc2\xa03d 1055, 1064 (CA9 2006)).  The Court of Appeals then turned to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that Vice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the case, even though state-law claims remained unadjudicated.  Repeating the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s view that the whole litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims, the Fifth Circuit upheld the fee award.  See 594 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 428.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Southwick dissented.  He agreed that Vice was entitled to some reimbursement for fees.  <em>Id.,</em> at 430.  But he thought the District Court had erred in declining to \xe2\x80\x9callocate the fees separately between the successful claims and the unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d ones just because all of them were \xe2\x80\x9cinterrelated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen some claims are dismissed as frivolous and others are not,\xe2\x80\x9d he stated, the defendants should receive fees only for \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal work allocable solely or dominantly to the dismissed\xe2\x80\x9d claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 431.  Because in this case \xe2\x80\x9calmost all of the defendant[s\xe2\x80\x99] discovery and factual analysis would have been necessary even if no federal claims had been brought,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, the fee award should have been much smaller.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision deepened a Circuit split about whether and to what extent a court may award fees to a defendant under \xc2\xa71988 when a plaintiff asserts both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  One Court of Appeals has forbidden any compensation unless all of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims are frivolous.  See <em>Balmer</em> v. <em>HCA, Inc.</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 606, 617 (CA6 2005).  Others have rejected this approach, but struggled with how to allocate fees in a suit that involves a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Compare, <em>e.g., </em>594 F.\xc2\xa03d 423 (CA5 2010) (opinion below), with <em>Colombrito</em> v. <em>Kelly</em>, 764 F.\xc2\xa02d 122, 132 (CA2 1985) (declining to award fees when the frivolous claim \xe2\x80\x9cadded no additional testimony or expense to the trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  We granted certiorari to resolve these questions.  562 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our legal system generally requires each party to bear his own litigation expenses, including attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, re-gardless whether he wins or loses.  Indeed, this principle is so firmly entrenched that it is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.</em> v. <em>Wilderness Society</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/index.html">421 U. S. 240</a>, 247 (1975).  But Congress has authorized courts to deviate from this background rule in certain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to another.  See <em>Burlington</em> v. <em>Dague</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/557/index.html">505 U. S. 557</a>, 562 (1992) (listing federal fee-shifting provisions).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute involved here, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988, allows the award of \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d in various kinds of civil rights cases, including suits brought under \xc2\xa71983.  Most of our decisions addressing this provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevailing plaintiffs.  When a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a civil rights violation, we have stated, he serves \xe2\x80\x9cas a\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98private attorney general,\xe2\x80\x99 vindicating a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newman</em> v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/400/index.html">390 U. S. 400</a>, 402 (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  He therefore \xe2\x80\x9cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d from the defendant\xe2\x80\x94the party whose misconduct created the need for legal action.  <em>Christiansburg Garment Co.</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/412/index.html"></a><a href="/us/434/412/index.html">434 U. S. 412</a>, 416 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fee shifting in such a case at once reimburses a plaintiff for \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it cos[t] [him] to vindicate [civil] rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Riverside</em> v. <em>Rivera</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/561/index.html">477 U. S. 561</a>, 577\xe2\x80\x93578 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted), and holds to account \xe2\x80\x9ca violator of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Christiansburg</em>, 434 U. S., at 418.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Christiansburg</em>, we held that \xc2\xa71988 also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant, but under a different standard reflecting the \xe2\x80\x9cquite different equitable considerations\xe2\x80\x9d at stake.  <em>Id.,</em> at 419.  In enacting \xc2\xa71988, we stated, Congress sought \xe2\x80\x9cto protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 420.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa71988 authorizes a district court to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cupon a finding that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 421; see also <em>Kentucky</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/159/index.html">473 U. S. 159</a>, 165, n.\xc2\xa09 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These standards would be easy to apply if life were like the movies, but that is usually not the case.  In Hollywood, litigation most often concludes with a dramatic verdict that leaves one party fully triumphant and the other utterly prostrate.  The court in such a case would know exactly how to award fees (even if that anti-climactic scene is generally left on the cutting-room floor).  But in the real world, litigation is more complex, involving multiple claims for relief that implicate a mix of legal theories and have different merits.  Some claims succeed; others fail.  Some charges are frivolous; others (even if not ultimately successful) have a reasonable basis.  In short, litigation is messy, and courts must deal with this untidiness in awarding fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this reality, we have made clear that plaintiffs may receive fees under \xc2\xa71988 even if they are not victorious on every claim.  A civil rights plaintiff who obtains meaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law and, in so doing, has vindicated Congress\xe2\x80\x99s statutory pur-poses.  That \xe2\x80\x9cresult is what matters,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained in <em>Hensley</em> v. <em>Eckerhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/424/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/424/index.html">461 U. S. 424</a>, 435 (1983): A court should compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney reasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome, even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The fee award, of course, should not reimburse the plaintiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to the grant of relief: Such work \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted)<em>.  </em>But the presence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a defendant against paying for the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees that the plaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his civil rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Analogous principles indicate that a defendant may deserve fees even if not all the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claims were frivolous.  In this context, \xc2\xa71988 serves to relieve a defendant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges.  The plaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations, and the court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those claims imposed on his adversary.  See <em>Christiansburg</em>, 434 U. S., at 420\xe2\x80\x93421.  That remains true when the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit also includes non-frivolous claims.  The defendant, of course, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non-frivolous charges.  See <em>ibid.  </em>But the presence of reasonable allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims\nimposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, we have previously said exactly this much.  In <em>Hensley</em>, we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might prevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an unrelated frivolous claim.  In this situation, we explained, a court could properly award fees to both parties\xe2\x80\x94to the plaintiff, to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the meritorious claim; and to the defendant, to compensate for the fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.  See 461 U. S., at 435, n.\xc2\xa010.  We thus made clear that a court may reimburse a defendant for costs under \xc2\xa71988 even if a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit is not wholly frivolous.  Fee-shifting to recompense a defendant (as to recompense a plaintiff) is not all-or-nothing: A defendant need not show that every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify for fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question then becomes one of allocation: In a lawsuit involving a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims, what work may the defendant receive fees for?  Vice concedes, as he must, that a defendant may not obtain compensation for work unrelated to a frivolous claim.  Brief for Respondents 42, n.\xc2\xa013.  Similarly, we think Fox would have to concede (once he has lost the argument that the presence of any non-frivolous claim precludes a fee award) that the defendant may receive reasonable fees for work related exclusively to a frivolous claim.  The question in dispute concerns work that helps defend against non-frivolous and frivolous claims alike\xe2\x80\x94for example, a deposition eliciting facts relevant to both allegations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Vice proposes authorizing the trial court to award fees for work that is \xe2\x80\x9cfairly attributable\xe2\x80\x9d to the frivolous portion of the lawsuit.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 45.  But that standard is in truth no standard at all.  The very question under consideration is: What fees may be fairly attributed to frivolous claims under \xc2\xa71988?  To answer \xe2\x80\x9cThose that are fairly attributable to frivolous claims\xe2\x80\x9d is just to restate this question.  And that non-response response would leave to each and every trial court not only the implementation, but also the invention, of the applicable legal standard.  We do not think trial courts would appreciate that lack of guidance.  And yet more important, we do not think such an empty and amorphous test would ensure that all fee awards to defendants comport with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in enacting \xc2\xa71988.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That congressional policy points to a different and more meaningful standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim.  Or what is the same thing stated as a but-for test: Section 1988 permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim.  Recall that the relevant purpose of \xc2\xa71988 is to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation.  See <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  So if a frivolous claim occasioned the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees at issue, a court may decide that the defendant should not have to pay them.  But if the defendant would have incurred those fees anyway, to defend against <em>non</em>-frivolous claims, then a court has no basis\nfor transferring the expense to the plaintiff.  Suppose, for example, that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attorney conducts a deposition on matters relevant to both a frivolous and a non-frivolous claim\xe2\x80\x94and more, that the lawyer would have taken and committed the same time to this deposition even if the case had involved only the non-frivolous allegation.  In that circumstance, the work does not implicate Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reason for allowing defendants to collect fees.  The defendant would have incurred the expense in any event; he has suffered no incremental<font b="1"> harm from the frivolous claim.  In short, the defendant has never shouldered the burden that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa71988, wanted to relieve.  The basic American Rule thus continues to operate.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defendants, making them better off because they were subject to a suit including frivolous claims.  For under any more permissive test, the simple presence of a frivolous claim would allow the court to shift to the plaintiff some of the costs of defending against regular, non-frivolous charges.  So two defendants (call them Vice and Rice) could face identical non-frivolous allegations, but because Vice also confronted a frivolous claim, he might end by paying less than Rice to his attorneys.  The chance assertion\xe2\x80\x94for Vice, the downright lucky assertion\xe2\x80\x94of the frivolous claim could relieve him not only of the incremental costs of that claim but also of costs that he, like Rice, would have had to pay in its absence.  Section 1988 provides no warrant for that peculiar result; that statute was \xe2\x80\x9cnever intended to produce windfalls\xe2\x80\x9d for parties.  See <em>Farrar</em> v. <em>Hobby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/103/index.html">506 U. S. 103</a>, 115 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d standard we require may in some cases allow compensation to a defendant for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Suppose, for example, that a plaintiff asserts one frivolous and one non-frivolous claim, but that only the frivolous allegation can legally result in a damages award.  If an attorney performs work useful to defending against both, but did so only because of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s monetary exposure on the frivolous charge, a court may decide to shift fees.  Or similarly, imagine that the frivolous claim enables removal of the case to federal court, which in\nturn drives up litigation expenses.  Here too, our standard would permit awarding fees for work relevant to both claims in order to reflect the increased costs (if any) of the federal forum.  And frivolous claims may increase the cost of defending a suit in ways that are not reflected in the number of hours billed.  If a defendant could prove, for example, that a frivolous claim involved a specialized area that reasonably caused him to hire more expensive counsel for the entire case, then the court may reimburse the defendant for the increased marginal cost.  As all these examples show, the dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous allegation.  The answers to those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge, it is the second that matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We emphasize, as we have before, that the determination of fees \xe2\x80\x9cshould not result in a second major litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hensley</em>, 461 U. S., at 437.  The fee applicant (whether a plaintiff or a defendant) must, of course, submit appropriate documentation to meet \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of establishing entitlement to an award.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>But trial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants.  The essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.  So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s time.  And appellate courts must give substantial deference to these determinations, in light of \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court\xe2\x80\x99s superior understanding of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see <em>Webb</em> v. <em>Dyer County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/234/index.html">471 U. S. 234</a>, 244 (1985).  We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial decisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has less to recommend it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the trial court must apply the correct standard, and the appeals court must make sure that has occurred.  See <em>Perdue</em> v. <em>Kenny A.</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9cDetermining a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x99 is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge, \xe2\x80\xa6 but the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion is not unlimited\xe2\x80\x9d); Cf. <em>Koon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html">518 U. S. 81</a>, 100 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cA district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  That means the trial court must determine whether the fees requested would not have accrued but for the frivolous claim.  And the appeals court must determine whether the trial court asked and answered that question, rather than some other.  A trial court has wide discretion when, but only when, it calls the game by the right rules.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The task remains of applying these principles to the fee award Vice received.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suggests that Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous claims.  As noted earlier, see <em>supra</em>, at 3,<em> </em>the court acknowledged that Fox\xe2\x80\x99s federal and state-law claims were \xe2\x80\x9cinterrelated,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a (internal quotation marks omitted).  The charges \xe2\x80\x9carose out of the same transaction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Vice\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the campaign\xe2\x80\x94and their \xe2\x80\x9cdefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).<em> </em>It therefore seems likely that Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would at least have conducted similar fact-gathering activities\xe2\x80\x94taken many of the same depositions, produced and reviewed many of the same documents, and so forth.  Indeed, the District Court highlighted the usefulness of the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 work to defending against the state-law claims: In its order remanding those claims, the court noted that the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial preparation, legal research, and discovery\xe2\x80\x9d done in the federal court could \xe2\x80\x9cbe used by the parties in the state court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 40a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to award full attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to Vice failed to take proper account of this overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.  Rather than apply the but-for standard we have set out, the court indicated that the paramount factor was the parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d in the litigation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33a.<em> </em>The court did not address whether the \xe2\x80\x9cinterrelated[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d of the claims meant that Vice would have incurred part or most of his fees even if Fox had asserted only the non-frivolous state-law claims.  To the contrary, the court suggested that the close relationship between the federal and state-law claims supported Vice\xe2\x80\x99s request to recover <em>all</em> of his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  See <em>id.</em>, at 28a; <em>supra</em>, at 3.  That reasoning stands the appropriate analysis on its head.  It cannot be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs of <em>frivolous </em>litigation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did the Court of Appeals uphold the award of fees on the ground that we would require.  The majority articulated a standard that, taken alone, might be read as consistent with our opinion; according to the court, a defendant should receive fees for \xe2\x80\x9cwork which can be distinctly traced to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s frivolous claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  594 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 429<em>.  </em>But the court seemed to think that its test permitted awarding Vice fees for any work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if lawyers would have done that work regardless.  Indeed, this very point divided the majority and the dissent.  Judge Southwick objected to the fee award on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9calmost all [of] the defendant[s\xe2\x80\x99] discovery and factual analysis would have been necessary even if no federal claims had been brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 431.  But the majority never responded to that argument or otherwise engaged this crucial question.  The majority instead merely reiterated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that the parties had principally \xe2\x80\x9cfocus[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d on the \xc2\xa71983 allegations.  That finding, as we have explained, is irrelevant if Vice\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys would have performed the same work to defend against the state-law claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this record, we must return the case to the lower courts.  See, <em>e.g., Perdue</em>, 559 U. S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9315); <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/546/index.html">478 U.

In a suit of this kind, involving both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a defendant may recover the reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees he expended solely because of the frivolous allegations.  And that is all.  Consistent with the policy underlying \xc2\xa71988, the defendant may not receive compensation for any fees that he would have paid in the absence of the frivolous claims.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Vice died during the course of this litigation.
