If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or \xe2\x80\x9cprovides that all of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income to be received\xe2\x80\x9d over the plan\xe2\x80\x99s duration \xe2\x80\x9cwill be applied to make payments\xe2\x80\x9d in accordance with plan terms.  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(b)(1).  Before enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  Though it did not define \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d most bankruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determining the \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the result.  In exceptional cases, those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income or expenses.  BAPCPA defines \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income received by the debtor\xe2\x80\x9d less \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d for, <em>e.g.,</em> the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance and support.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A)(i).  \xe2\x80\x9cCurrent monthly income,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, is calculated by averaging the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly income during a 6-month look-back period preceding the petition\xe2\x80\x99s filing.  See \xc2\xa7101(10A)(A)(i).  If a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income is below the median for his or her State, \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d include the full amount needed for \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance or support,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A one-time buyout from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s former employer caused her current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13 petition to exceed her State\xe2\x80\x99s median income.  However, based on the income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03.  She thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months.  Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because she had not committed all of her \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d to repaying creditors.  Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60 months.  Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month period, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d requires courts to consider the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actual income.  The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court calculating \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d should begin with the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income, the court may account for changes in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Respondent has the better interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Asgrow Seed Co.</em> v. <em>Winterboer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/179/index.html">513 U. S. 179</a>, 187.  In ordinary usage future occurrences are not \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself.  While a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the outcome.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d appears in many federal statutes, yet Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication.  See, <em>e.g., </em>7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(b)(8)(B).  By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows, Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambiguous\xe2\x80\x94commonly using the term \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplied.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(b)(3).  Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income, but would also have discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income.  This is significant, since the Court \xe2\x80\x9cwill not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America</em> v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/443/index.html">549 U. S. 443</a>, 454, and Congress did not amend the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in 2005.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The mechanical approach also clashes with \xc2\xa71325\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  First, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cto be received in the applicable commitment period\xe2\x80\x9d strongly favors the forward-looking approach.  Because respondent would have far less than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cto be received.\xe2\x80\x9d  In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effectively reads that phrase out of the statute.  Second, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s direction to courts to determine projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cas of the effective date of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 <em>i.e., </em>the confirmation date\xe2\x80\x94is more consistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information about a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial situation.  Had Congress intended for projected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable income, it could have specified the plan\xe2\x80\x99s <em>filing</em> date as the effective date.  Third, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cwill be applied to make payments\xe2\x80\x9d is rendered a hollow command if, as of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, the debtor lacks the means to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unpersuasive.  The claim that the Code\xe2\x80\x99s detailed and precise \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d definition would have no purpose without the mechanical approach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula plays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a disposable income calculation.  The Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rebuttable \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court rejects petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that only the mechanical approach is consistent with \xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)).\xe2\x80\x9d  And the Court declines to infer from the fact that \xc2\xa71325(b)(3) incorporates \xc2\xa7707\xe2\x80\x94which allows courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d but only with respect to calculating expenses\xe2\x80\x94that Congress intended to eliminate, <em>sub silentio</em>, the discretion that courts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain changes.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors\xe2\x80\x94a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually high income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a 6-month period more representative of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s future disposable income; a debtor could dismiss the petition and refile at a later, more favorable date; and respondent might have been able to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or converting her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7\xe2\x80\x94are all flawed.

Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to keep their property, but they must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a).  A bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a Chapter 13 debtor\xe2\x80\x99s plan.  \xc2\xa71322(a)(1); see also 28 U.

Before the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code) loosely defined \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cincome which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d for the \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance or support of the debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d for qualifying charitable contributions, or for business expenditures.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Code did not define the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable income.  That is, they first multiplied monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determined what portion of the result was \xe2\x80\x9cexcess\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 2 K.

See \xc2\xa7101(10A)(A)(i).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(2) is also newly defined.  For a debtor whose income is below the median for his or her State, the phrase includes the full amount needed for \xe2\x80\x9cmaintenance or support,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with income that exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2006.  In the six months before her filing, she received a one-time buyout from her former employer, and this payment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to $11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42).  App. 84, 107.  As a result of these payments, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s current monthly income, as averaged from April through October 2006, was $5,343.70\xe2\x80\x94a figure that exceeds the median income for a family of one in Kansas.  See <em>id.</em>, at 78.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to \xc2\xa7707(b)(2), were $4,228.71.  <em>Id.</em>, at 83.  She reported a monthly \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the form used for reporting monthly income (Schedule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per month\xe2\x80\x94which is below the state median.  <em>Id.</em>, at 66; see also <em>id.</em>, at 78.  On the form used for reporting monthly expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly expenses of $1,772.97.  <em>Id.</em>, at 68.  Subtracting the Schedule J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly disposable income of $149.03.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months.  See <em>id.</em>, at 93.  Petitioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the amount respondent proposed to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against her, see \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s view, respondent was not committing all of her \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d to the repayment of creditors, see \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B).  According to petitioner, the proper way to calculate projected disposable income was simply to multiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the number of months in the commitment period.  Employing this mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that creditors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly payments of $756 for a period of 60 months.  <em>Id.</em>, at 108.  There is no dispute that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s actual income was insufficient to make payments in that amount.

The court agreed with the majority view that the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B) requires courts \xe2\x80\x9cto consider at confirmation the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s <em>actual</em> income as it was reported on Schedule I.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at *5 (emphasis added).  This conclusion was warranted by the text of \xc2\xa71325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bankruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating finances in the six months before filing.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed.  380 B.\xc2\xa0R. 17, 19 (2007).  The Panel noted that, although Congress redefined \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre-existing term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 24.  Thus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice under which bankruptcy courts determined projected disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but considered other evidence when there was reason to believe that the schedules did not reflect a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actual ability to pay.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  545 F.\xc2\xa03d 1269, 1270 (2008).

Respondent, who favors the forward-looking approach, agrees that the method outlined by petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she argues that in exceptional cases, where significant changes in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial circumstances are known or virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to make an appropriate adjustment.  Respondent has the stronger argument.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is supported by the ordinary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Asgrow Seed Co.</em> v. <em>Winterboer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/179/index.html">513 U. S. 179</a>, 187 (1995).  Here, the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d is not defined, and in ordinary usage future occurrences are not \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself.  For example, projections concerning a company\xe2\x80\x99s future sales or the future cash flow from a license take into account anticipated events that may change past trends.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Tellabs, Inc.</em> v. <em>Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/308/index.html">551 U. S. 308</a>, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to \xe2\x80\x9cprojected sales\xe2\x80\x9d in light of falling demand); <em>Innovair Aviation, Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504\xe2\x80\x93506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that past sales are \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily the number of sales\xe2\x80\x9d that will be made in the future).  On the night of an election, experts do not \xe2\x80\x9cproject\xe2\x80\x9d the percentage of the votes that a candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candidate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the first few reporting precincts.  And sports analysts do not project that a team\xe2\x80\x99s winning percentage at the end of a new season will be the same as the team\xe2\x80\x99s winning percentage last year or the team\xe2\x80\x99s winning percentage at the end of the first month of competition.  While a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome.  See <em>In re Kibbe</em>, 361 B.\xc2\xa0R. 302, 312, n.\xc2\xa09 (Bkrtcy.

For example, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 defined \xe2\x80\x9cprojected national yield,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprojected county yield,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprojected farm yield\xe2\x80\x9d as entailing historical averages \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted for abnormal weather conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctrends in yields,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany significant changes in production practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 U.

Prior to BAPCPA, the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income.

See 2 Lundin \xc2\xa7164.1, at 164\xe2\x80\x931 (2000 ed.) (\xe2\x80\x9cMost courts focus on the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current income and extend current income (and expenditures) over the life of the plan to calculate projected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d).

Indeed, petitioner concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to BAPCPA.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America</em> v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/443/index.html">549 U. S. 443</a>, 454 (2007); <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U.

Congress did not amend the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in 2005, and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely acknowledged and well-documented view that courts may take into account known or virtually certain changes to debtors\xe2\x80\x99 income or expenses when projecting disposable income.  In light of this historical practice, we would expect that, had Congress intended for \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d to carry a specialized\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, unusual\xe2\x80\x94meaning in Chapter 13, Congress would have said so expressly.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining \xe2\x80\x9cprojected earnings\xe2\x80\x9d as reflecting a 3-year historical average).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with the terms of 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cto be received in the applicable commitment period\xe2\x80\x9d strongly favors the forward-looking approach.  There is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive far less than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, so petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s projection does not accurately reflect \xe2\x80\x9cincome to be received\xe2\x80\x9d during that period.  See <em>In re Nowlin</em>, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009).  The mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of the statute when a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current disposable income is substantially higher than the income that the debtor predictably will receive during the plan period.  See <em>Kawaauhau</em> v. <em>Geiger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/57/index.html">523 U. S. 57</a>, 62 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cas of the effective date of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and becomes binding, see \xc2\xa71327(a).  Had Congress intended for projected disposable income to be nothing more than a multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no reason why Congress would not have required courts to determine that value as of the <em>filing</em> date of the plan.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at http://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulemaking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file)<f f="Times New Roman">.  In th<f f="Century Schoolbook">e very next section of the Code, for example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence payments \xe2\x80\x9cnot later than 30 days after the <em>date of the filing of the plan</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71326(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to require courts to measure projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cas of the <em>effective</em> date of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d is more consistent with the view that Congress expected courts to consider postfiling information about the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s financial circumstances.  See 545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1279 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured creditors \xe2\x80\x98as of the effective date of the plan\xe2\x80\x99 suggests consideration of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s actual financial circumstances as of the effective date of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d).</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the requirement that projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cwill be applied to make payments\xe2\x80\x9d is most naturally read to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B).  But when, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks the means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow command.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical approach are unpersuasive.  Noting that the Code now provides a detailed and precise definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d proponents of the mechanical approach maintain that any departure from this method leaves that definition \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with no apparent purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Kagenveama</em>, 541 F. 3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008).  This argument overlooks the important role that the statutory formula for calculating \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d plays under the forward-looking approach.  As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing more is required.  It is only in unusual cases that a court may go further and take into account other known or virtually certain information about the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s future income or expenses.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a rebuttable \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d that the figure produced by the mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 545 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1278\xe2\x80\x931279.  Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference to any such presumption but that related Code provisions expressly create other rebuttable presumptions.  See \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  He thus suggests that the Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the Code.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, simply heeds the ordinary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d  As noted, a person making a projection uses past occurrences as a starting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Circuit prescribed.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nowlin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 260, 263.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is consistent with \xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)).\xe2\x80\x9d  This cross-reference, petitioner argues, shows that Congress intended for the term \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d to incorporate, presumably in all contexts, the defined term \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is evident that \xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term \xe2\x80\x9cdis-\nposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71325(b)(2), but that fact offers\nno insight into the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d\nin \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B).  We fail to see\nhow that word acquires a specialized meaning as a\nresult of this cross-reference\xe2\x80\x94particularly where both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cto be received\xe2\x80\x9d during the relevant period.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner also notes that \xc2\xa7707 allows courts to take \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d into consideration, but that \xc2\xa71325(b)(3) incorporates \xc2\xa7707 only with respect to calculating expenses.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Wilson</em>, 397 B.\xc2\xa0R. 299, 314\xe2\x80\x93315 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008).  Thus, he argues, a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d exception should not be inferred with respect to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income.  We decline to infer from \xc2\xa71325\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation of \xc2\xa7707 that Congress intended to eliminate, <em>sub silentio</em>, the discretion that courts previously exercised when projecting disposable income to account for known or virtually certain changes.  Accord, <em>In\xc2\xa0re</em> <em>Liverman</em>, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n.\xc2\xa015 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In cases in which a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income during the 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower or higher than the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income during the plan period, the mechanical approach would produce senseless results that we do not think Congress intended.  In cases in which the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income is higher during the plan period, the mechanical approach would deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily make.  And where, as in the present case, the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income during the plan period is substantially lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter\xe2\x80\x99s main eligibility requirements.  Here, for example, respondent is an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual whose income is sufficiently stable and regular\xe2\x80\x9d to allow her \xe2\x80\x9cto make payments under a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in \xc2\xa7109(e).  But if the mechanical approach were used, she could not file a confirmable plan.

We see little merit in this convoluted strategy.  If the Code required the use of the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would improperly undermine what the Code demands.  And if, as we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is not needed.

The availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who have above-median incomes is limited.  In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case, a presumption of abuse would attach under \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplied by 60,\xe2\x80\x9d exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and (II).

The Code provides a formula for \xe2\x80\x9cproject[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d what a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d will be, which so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on his past income.  The Court concludes that this formula should not apply in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9cknown or virtually certain\xe2\x80\x9d changes in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances make it a poor predictor.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  Because that conclusion is contrary to the Code\xe2\x80\x99s text, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A bankruptcy court cannot confirm a Chapter 13 plan over the objection of the trustee unless, as of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, either (A) the property to be distributed on account of the unsecured claim at issue exceeds its amount or (B) the \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan provides that all of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B).  The Code does not define \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d but it does define \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income.\xe2\x80\x9d  The next paragraph of \xc2\xa71325(b) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of this subsection, the term \xe2\x80\x98disposable income\xe2\x80\x99 means current monthly income received by the debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d excluding certain payments received for child support, \xe2\x80\x9cless amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d on three categories of expenses.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2).  The Code in turn defines \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0derived during the 6-month period ending on\xe2\x80\x9d one of two dates.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xc2\xa7101(10A)(A).  Whichever date applies, a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus the income component of his \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income,\xe2\x80\x9d is a sum certain, a rate fixed once for all based on historical figures.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This definition of \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d applies to the use of that term in the longer phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it applies to subsection (b).  Cf. \xc2\xa71129(a)(15)(B) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2))\xe2\x80\x9d).  The puzzle is what to make of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, this modifier makes all the difference.  Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later developments, not just past data.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Thus, the Court concludes, in determining \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d a bankruptcy court may depart from \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s inflexible formula, at least in \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional cases,\xe2\x80\x9d to account for \xe2\x80\x9csignificant changes\xe2\x80\x9d in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, either actual or anticipated.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That interpretation runs aground because it either renders superfluous text Congress included or requires adding text Congress did not.  It would be pointless to define disposable income in such detail, based on data during a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set the resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor predictor.  And since \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d appears nowhere else in \xc2\xa71325(b), then unless \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition applies to \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B), it does not apply at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court insists its interpretation does not render \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation of \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income\xe2\x80\x9d a nullity: A bankruptcy court must still <em>begin</em> with that figure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d change in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances is \xe2\x80\x9cknown or virtually certain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 12.  That construction conveniently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning the text the Court purports to construe.  Nothing in the text supports treating the definition of disposable income Congress supplied as a suggestion.  And even if the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d did allow (or direct) a court to disregard \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s fixed formula and to consider other data, there would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the Court reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court may (or must) do so.  If the statute authorizes estimations, it authorizes them in <em>every</em> case, not just those where changes to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income are both \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d and either \xe2\x80\x9cknown or virtually certain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>If the evidence indicates it is merely more likely than not that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income will increase by some minimal amount, there is no reading of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d that permits (or requires) a court to ignore that change.  The Court, in short, can arrive at its compromise construction only by rewriting the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words Congress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this:  Setting aside expenses excludable under \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A) and (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calculate the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d by multiplying his current monthly income by the number of months in the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable commitment period.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to a calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (collecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1957).  But one assuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures based on the past.  And here Congress has commanded that a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the projection.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic.  A projection, the Court explains, may be based in <em>part</em> on past data, but \xe2\x80\x9cadjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  No gambler would bet the farm using \xe2\x80\x9cproject[ions]\xe2\x80\x9d that are based only on a football team\xe2\x80\x99s play <em>before</em> its star quarterback was injured.  And no pundit would keep his post if he \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d election results relying only on prior cycles, ignoring recent polls.  So too, the Court appears to reason, it makes no sense to say a court \xe2\x80\x9cproject[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d when it considers only what he earned in a specific 6-month period in the past.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such analogies do not establish that carrying current monthly income forward to determine a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s future ability to pay is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprojection.\xe2\x80\x9d  They show only that relying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a bad idea.  One who is asked to predict future results, but is armed with no other information than prior performance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the mark.  Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent that possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other contexts, that a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income be determined based on the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71364(c)(2), or \xe2\x80\x9cany\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0relevant information,\xe2\x80\x9d 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72009(c)(1).   But it included no such prescription here, and instead identified the data a court should consider.  Perhaps Congress concluded that other information a bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too easily manipulated.  Or perhaps it thought the cost of considering such information outweighed the benefits.  Cf. 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71301(b)(13)(J)\xe2\x80\x93(M) (requiring national and local \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d yields of various crops to be adjusted only for abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production practices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably relevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease in the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.).  In all events, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the projection method Congress chose has any bearing on what the statute means.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts to multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it would have used the word \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplied,\xe2\x80\x9d as it has done elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71325(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x94instead of the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  I do not dispute that, as a general matter, we should presume that Congress does not ordinarily use two words in the same context to denote the same thing.  But if forced to choose between (A) assuming Congress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B) ascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word \xe2\x80\x9cprojected\xe2\x80\x9d (loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid undesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed synonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the least evil.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, we are not put to that choice here.  While under my reading a court must determine the <em>income</em> half of the \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d equation by multiplying a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the <em>expenses</em> excludable under \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A) and (B).  Unlike the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s current monthly income, none of the three types of expenses\xe2\x80\x94payments for the support of the debtor and his dependents, charitable contributions, and expenses to keep an existing business above water\xe2\x80\x94is explicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for debtors with incomes below the state median).  The first of those cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based on the same 6-month period from which current monthly income is derived,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and the texts of the other two are consistent with determining expenses based on expectations.  See \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to qualified entities limited to \xe2\x80\x9c15 percent of gross income of the debtor for the year in which the contributions are made\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71325(b)(2)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cexpenditures necessary for the continuation, preservation, and operation\xe2\x80\x9d of a business in which the debtor is engaged).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income consists of two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed once for all based on historical data, and another (the enumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on estimations of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s future circumstances.  The statute thus requires the court to predict the difference between two figures, each of which depends on the duration of the commitment period, and one of which also turns partly on facts besides historical data.  In light of all this, it seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process as projection, not merely multiplication.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s remaining arguments about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning are easily dispatched.  A \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical\xe2\x80\x9d reading of projected disposable income, it contends, renders superfluous the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto be received in the applicable commitment period\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B).  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  Not at all.  That phrase defines the period for which a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s disposable income must be calculated (<em>i.e.</em>, the period over which the projection extends), and thus the amount the debtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly insubstantial is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim regarding the requirement that the plan provide that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cwill be applied to make payments\xe2\x80\x9d toward unsecured creditors\xe2\x80\x99 claims, \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B).  The Court says this requirement makes no sense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount equal to his projected disposable income.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But it makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is entitled to confirmation in the first place; and that assumption is wrong.  The requirement that the debtor pay at least his projected disposable income is a <em>prerequisite</em> to confirmation.  The \xe2\x80\x9cwill be applied\xe2\x80\x9d proviso does not require a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds Chapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also argues that \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s directive to determine projected disposable income \xe2\x80\x9cas of the effective date of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d makes no sense if mere multiplication of existing numbers is required.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  As I have explained, however, \xe2\x80\x9cprojected disposable income\xe2\x80\x9d may in some cases require more than multiplication (as to expenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the date of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s filing until the date it takes effect.  Moreover, the provision also applies to the alternative avenue to confirmation in \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(A), which requires that \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of the property to be distributed under the plan\xe2\x80\x9d to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  As to that requirement, the effective-date requirement makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns with the atextual approach the Court adopts today.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  That is unsurprising, since the prior version of the relevant provisions was completely consistent with that approach.  The Court is correct that BAPCPA \xe2\x80\x9cdid not amend the term \xe2\x80\x98projected disposable income,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10.  But it <em>did</em> amend the <em>definition</em> of that term.  Before 2005, \xc2\xa71325(b)(2) defined \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d simply as \xe2\x80\x9cincome which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended\xe2\x80\x9d on the same basic types of expenses excluded by the current statute.  \xc2\xa71325(b)(2) (2000 ed.).  Nothing in that terse definition compelled a court to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6-month period.  But in BAPCPA\xe2\x80\x94the same Act in which Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101(10A)(A)\xe2\x80\x94Congress redefined \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking definition.  See Pub. L. 109\xe2\x80\x938, \xc2\xa7102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  Given these significant changes, the fact that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only does not recommend it, see <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare</em> v. <em>Davenport</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/552/index.html">495 U. S. 552</a>, 563\xe2\x80\x93564 (1990), but renders it suspect.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the statute says, the Court falls back on the \xe2\x80\x9csenseless results\xe2\x80\x9d it would produce\xe2\x80\x94results the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not think Congress intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Even if it were true that a \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical\xe2\x80\x9d reading resulted in undesirable outcomes, that would make no difference.  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11).  For even assuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know which results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoiding) apart from the only congressional expression of its thoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrelevant to what the statute means.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as inevitable nor as \xe2\x80\x9csenseless\xe2\x80\x9d as the Court portrays.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s first concern is that if actual or anticipated changes in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s earnings are ignored, then a debtor whose income increases after the critical 6-month window will not be required to pay all he can afford.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  But as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9323, Chapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the request of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t any time after confirmation\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cincrease\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0the amount of payments\xe2\x80\x9d on a class of claims or \xe2\x80\x9creduce the time for such payments.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71329(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2) (2006 ed.).  The Court offers no explanation of why modification would not be available in such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor whose income suddenly <em>declines </em>after the 6-month window or who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during that window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief because he will be unable to devote his \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable income\xe2\x80\x9d (which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unsecured creditors going forward.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  At least for debtors whose circumstances deteriorate <em>after</em> confirmation, however, the Code already provides an answer.  Just as a creditor can request an upward modification in light of postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask for a downward adjustment.  \xc2\xa71329(a).  Cf. \xc2\xa71329(b)(1) (requiring that modifications meet requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71322(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not \xc2\xa71325(b)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even apart from the availability of modification it requires little imagination to see why Congress might want to withhold relief from debtors whose situations have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the end of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire straits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by an influx of unusually high income.  Bankruptcy protection is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably conclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet need a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they will recover.  And perhaps the debtor who has received a one-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.  How long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is inherently a policy choice.  Congress confined the calculation of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordinarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could have picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) instead.  Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we should not assume it did not know what it was doing and accordingly refuse to give effect to its words.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors, the Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies the trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50\xe2\x80\x9354:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presumably some debtors whose income has only recently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that causes a temporary uptick in their average income, can delay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent monthly income\xe2\x80\x9d catches up with their present circumstances.  The Court speculates that delay might \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[e] the appearance of bad faith,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15 (citing \xc2\xa71325(a)(7)), but it offers no explanation of why that is so, and no authority supporting it.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if bad faith were a real worry, or if it were essential to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prospects that he invoke \xc2\xa7362\xe2\x80\x99s automatic stay immediately, the debtor might ask the bankruptcy court to excuse him from filing a statement of current income, so that it determines his \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently monthly income\xe2\x80\x9d at a later date.  See \xc2\xa7101(10A)(A)(ii).  The Court dismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code requires a mechanical approach this solution would \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly undermine\xe2\x80\x9d it, and if the Code allows exceptions for changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  The second premise is correct, but the first is not.  Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.  <em>Rodriguez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/522/index.html">480 U. S. 522</a>, 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (1987) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Here it may have struck the very balance the Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but leaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x82A debtor who learns after filing that he will be unable to repay his full projected disposable income might also be able to dismiss his case and refile it later.  \xc2\xa71307(b).  The Court worries that this alternative also might be deemed abusive, again with no pertinent authority for the speculation.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this \xe2\x80\x9ccircumvents the statutory limits on a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to shift the look-back period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  That belief is mistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statutory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and because, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income formula\xe2\x80\x99s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time of determining that figure, it would not undermine the limitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to allow the debtor to dismiss and refile.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x82A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to Chapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7.  The Court declares this cold comfort, noting that some debtors\xe2\x80\x94including Lanning\xe2\x80\x94will have incomes <em>too high</em> to qualify for Chapter 7.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  Some such debtors, however, may be able to show \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7.  Aside from noting the absence of authority on the issue, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the special-circumstances exception is available only if the debtor has \xe2\x80\x9cno reasonable alternative,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7707(b)(2)(B)(i), which will not be true after today given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s income.  As for those who cannot establish special circumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause for concern.  Congress has evidently concluded that such debtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and that they are not suitable candidates for repaying their debts (at least in part) under Chapter 13\xe2\x80\x99s protective umbrella.  We have neither reason nor warrant to second-guess either determination.</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Underlying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is an understandable urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields results that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending that reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit together.  But taking liberties with text in light of outcome makes sense only if we assume that we know better than Congress which outcomes are mistaken.  And by refusing to hold that Congress meant what it said, but see <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank</em> v. <em>Germain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/249/index.html">503 U. S. 249</a>, 253\xe2\x80\x93254 (1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in the future.  It may be that no interpretation of \xc2\xa71325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying.
