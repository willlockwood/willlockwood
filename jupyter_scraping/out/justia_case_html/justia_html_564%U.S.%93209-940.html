JUVENILE MALE<br/>\n560 U. S. ____ (2010)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">UNITED STATES <em>v.</em> JUVENILE MALE</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x93940\xe2\x80\x83Decided June 7, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Montana with juvenile delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75031 <em>et seq</em>.  Respondent eventually pleaded \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under 12 years of age, which would have been a crime under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an adult.  In June 2005, the District Court accepted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s plea and adjudged him delinquent.  The court sentenced respondent to two years\xe2\x80\x99 official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday.  The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center and to abide by the center\xe2\x80\x99s conditions of residency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716901 <em>et seq</em>.  With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716911(8); 16913.  In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements \xe2\x80\x9capply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].\xe2\x80\x9d  72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3 (2009)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondent\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program.  The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday.  The Government, invoking SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervision.  As \xe2\x80\x9cspecial conditions\xe2\x80\x9d of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  590 F.\xc2\xa03d 924 (2010).  The Court of Appeals determined that \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive application of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 927.  The court thus held that \xe2\x80\x9cSORNA\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 928.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination that SORNA violates the <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness.  Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender.  But on May 2, 2008, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions.  As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequences adequate to meet Article III\xe2\x80\x99s injury-in-fact requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/1/index.html">523 U. S. 1</a>, 14 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the most likely potential \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequenc[e]\xe2\x80\x9d that might be remedied by a judgment in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.  (\xe2\x80\x9cBy the time of the court of appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 29.)  We thus must know whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent \xe2\x80\x9ccould remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 15 (2009):</p>\n<p align="left">Is respondent\xe2\x80\x99s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont.
