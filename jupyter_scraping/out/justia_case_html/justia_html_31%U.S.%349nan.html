CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Upon an inspection of the record, it appears that the plaintiff claims in his declaration the sum of $1,241 as remaining due to him, and he has laid the <em>ad damnum</em> at $1,000.  Under such circumstances, a general verdict having been given against him, the matter in dispute is, in our opinion, the sum which he claims in the <em>ad damnum.</em>  The Court cannot judicially take notice that by computation it may possibly be made out as matter of inference from the declaration that the plaintiff\'s claim in reality must be less than $1,000; much less can it take such notice in a case where the plaintiff might be allowed interest on his claim by the jury so as to swell his claim beyond $1,000.</p>\n<p><em>The motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction is overruled.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
