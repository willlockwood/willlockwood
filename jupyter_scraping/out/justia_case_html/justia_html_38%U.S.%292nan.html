On consideration whereof this Court is of opinion that the silk hose, as manufactures of silk, not being sewing silk, were exempted from the payment of duty by the fourth section of the Act of March, 1833, entitled, "An act to modify the Act of 14 July, 1832, and all other acts imposing duties on imports," which declares that all manufactures of silk or of which silk is the component material of chief value coming from this side of the Cape of Good Hope except sewing silk shall be free of duty.  Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court that it be so certified to the said circuit court and that this case be remanded to the said court that further proceedings may be had therein according to law.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
