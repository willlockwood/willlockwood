The mere circumstance of delay, in trials of so much expectation and importance, though entitled to some consideration, would not be sufficient of itself to prevent a compliance with the present application: And, we think, that the 12th section of the Judicial act ought to be so construed, as to vest in the Judges a power of holding a special Court, in the proper County, if in other respects they do not deem it greatly inconvenient. The act of Congress, passed the 2nd of March 1793 , (2 Vol. p. 226. s. 3. Swift\'s edit.) empowers the Judges to \'direct a special sessions of the Circuit Court to be holden for the trial of criminal cases, at any convenient place within the District, nearer to the place where the offences may be said to be committed, than the place, or places, appointed by law for the ordinary sessions;\' but this provision does not expressly discriminate between cases of a capital, and of an inferior, nature; and a provision having been previously made for capital cases, it would be justifiable to apply this to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 3 U.S. 513, 514</a></p><p> inferior cases.

A trial in the proper County might have been ordered, when the offences were committed; but no candid man will say, that, at that time, such an order would have been justifiable. The next step, therefore, was to bind the offenders over to this Court, having complete jurisdiction of the case; and, now, the only questions are, whether it is practicable to refer the trials to the counties, respectively, in which the offences were committed?
