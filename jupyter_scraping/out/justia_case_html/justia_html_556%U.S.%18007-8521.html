Because Tennessee law no longer authorizes the appointment of state public defenders as clemency counsel, his federal counsel moved to expand the scope of her representation to include the state proceedings.  In denying the motion, the District Court relied on Circuit precedent construing 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599, which provides for the appointment of federal counsel.

Thus, federally funded counsel appointed to represent a state prisoner in \xc2\xa72254 proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cshall also represent the defendant in such \xe2\x80\xa6 proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(e).  Because state clemency proceedings are \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to state petitioners who obtain subsection (a)(2) representation, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language indicates that appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x99s authorized representation includes such proceedings.  Moreover, subsection (e)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings for \xe2\x80\xa6 other clemency\xe2\x80\x9d refers to state proceedings, as federal clemency is exclusively executive, while States administer clemency in various ways.  The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not expected to provide each service enumerated in subsection (e) for every client.  Rather, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation includes only those judicial proceedings transpiring \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d to her appointment, which under subsection (a)(2) begins with the \xc2\xa72254 or \xc2\xa72255 \xe2\x80\x9cpost-conviction process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to overcome \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s plain language are not persuasive.

Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention, a lawyer is not required to represent her client during a state retrial following postconviction relief because the retrial marks the commencement of new judicial proceedings, not a subsequent stage of existing proceedings; state postconviction proceedings are also not \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d to federal habeas proceedings.

BELL<br/>\n556 U.

In 1997, after the state courts rejected challenges to his conviction and sentence, the Federal District Court appointed the Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee to represent him in filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  During the course of that representation, counsel developed substantial evidence relating both to Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s culpability and to the appropriateness of his sentence.  Although the courts did not order relief, the evidence proved persuasive to one Circuit Judge.  See 408 F.\xc2\xa03d 823, 837\xe2\x80\x93846 (CA6 2005) (Clay, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after his habeas corpus petition was denied, Harbison requested counsel for state clemency proceedings.  In 2006, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that state law does not authorize the appointment of state public defenders as clemency counsel.  <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, No. M1987\xe2\x80\x9300072\xe2\x80\x93SC\xe2\x80\x93DPE\xe2\x80\x93DD <em>(per curiam),</em> 2006 Tenn. Lexis 1236, at *3 (2006).  Thereafter, Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s federally appointed counsel moved to expand the authorized scope of her representation to include state clemency proceedings.  Relying on Circuit precedent construing 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599, which provides for the appointment of federal counsel, the District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  503 F.\xc2\xa03d 566 (CA6 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to decide two questions: (1) whether a certificate of appealability (COA) is required to appeal an order denying a request for federally appointed counsel pursuant to \xc2\xa73599, and (2) whether \xc2\xa73599(e)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses state clemency proceedings.  We conclude that a COA is not necessary and that \xc2\xa73599 authorizes federally appointed counsel to represent clients in state clemency proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider whether Harbison was required to obtain a COA to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  The State of Tennessee and the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> agree with Harbison that he was not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s motion to authorize his federal counsel to represent him in state clemency proceedings was clearly an appealable order under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McFarland</em> v. <em>Scott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/849/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/849/index.html">512 U. S. 849</a> (1994) (reviewing the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment denying a petition for the appointment of counsel pursuant to the statute now codified at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599).  The question is whether Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s failure to obtain a COA pursuant to<font b="1"> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)(A) deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction over the appeal.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2253(c)(1)(A) provides that unless a circuit justice or judge issues a COA, an appeal may not be taken from \xe2\x80\x9cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\xe2\x80\x9d  This provision governs final orders that dispose of the merits of a habeas corpus proceeding\xe2\x80\x94a proceeding challenging the lawfulness of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s detention.  See generally <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U.

An order that merely denies a motion to enlarge the authority of appointed counsel (or that denies a motion for appointment of counsel) is not such an order and is therefore not subject to the COA requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The central question presented by this case is whether 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599 authorizes counsel appointed to represent a state petitioner in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 proceedings to represent him in subsequent state clemency proceedings.  Although Tennessee takes no position on this question, the Government defends the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the statute does not authorize such representation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the language of the statute.  Section 3599, titled \xe2\x80\x9cCounsel for financially unable defendants,\xe2\x80\x9d provides for the appointment of counsel for two classes of indigents, described, respectively, in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2).  The former states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n every criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime which may be punishable by death, a defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at any time either\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A)\xe2\x80\x82before judgment; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B)\xe2\x80\x82after the entry of a judgment imposing a\nsentence of death but before the execution of that judgment;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nSubsection (a)(2) states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn any post conviction proceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f).\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe parties agree that subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) make two different groups eligible for federally appointed counsel: (a)(1) describes federal capital defendants, while (a)(2) describes state and federal postconviction litigants,\nas indicated by its reference to both \xc2\xa72254 and \xc2\xa72255 proceedings.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After subsections (b) through (d) discuss counsel\xe2\x80\x99s necessary qualifications, subsection (e) sets forth counsel\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities.  It provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUnless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s own motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appointed shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriations motions and procedures, and <em>shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nFocusing on the italicized clause of subsection (e), Harbison contends that the plain language of the statute dictates the outcome of this case.  We are persuaded by his argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a straightforward reading of the statute, subsection (a)(2) triggers the appointment of counsel for habeas petitioners, and subsection (e) governs the scope of appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duties.  See \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) (stating that habeas petitioners challenging a death sentence shall be entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cthe furnishing of \xe2\x80\xa6 services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f)\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, once federally funded counsel is appointed to represent a state prisoner in \xc2\xa72254 proceedings, she \xe2\x80\x9cshall also represent the defendant in such \xe2\x80\xa6 proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(e).  Because state clemency proceedings are \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d to state petitioners who obtain representation pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the statutory language indicates that appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x99s authorized representation includes such proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends that, fairly read, the statute as a whole is intended to furnish representation only in federal proceedings and that all proceedings listed in subsection (e), including clemency proceedings, should be understood to be federal.  The absence of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d in this subsection is not dispositive, it maintains, because subsection (a)(1) likewise does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d yet the parties agree that provision concerns only federal defendants.  Just as \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d is implied by context in subsection (a)(1), so too, the Government says, is it implied in subsection (e).  According to the Government, the repeated use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d supports this reading: Congress contemplated that not all catalogued proceedings would be available to any given client,\nand clemency proceedings are simply not available to\nstate petitioners because they are ineligible for federal clemency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument is not convincing.  Subsection (a)(1) is properly understood as describing federal defendants because the statute is primarily concerned with federal criminal actions[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and (a)(1) includes no language suggesting that it applies more broadly.  By contrast, subsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants, and it in turn provides that subsection (e) applies to such litigants.  There is therefore no basis for assuming that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d in subsection (e) to indicate only federal clemency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the contrary, the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings for executive <em>or</em> <em>other</em> clemency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73599(e) (emphasis added), reveals that Congress intended to include state clemency proceedings within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Federal clemency is exclusively executive: Only the President has the power to grant clemency for offenses under federal law.  U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  By contrast, the States administer clemency in a variety of ways.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ga. Const., Art. IV, \xc2\xa72 (independent board has clemency authority); Nev. Const., Art. 5, \xc2\xa714 (governor, supreme court justices, and attorney general share clemency power); Fla. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa78 (legislature has clemency authority for treasonous offenses); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson</em>, 206 Conn. 267, 271, 537 A.\xc2\xa02d 1004, 1006\xe2\x80\x931007 (1988) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Connecticut, the pardoning power is vested in the legislature, which has delegated its exercise to the board of pardons\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reference to \xe2\x80\x9cother clemency\xe2\x80\x9d thus does not refer to federal clemency but instead encompasses the various forms of state clemency.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the word \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d is also misplaced.  While it maintains that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 repeated use of the word shows that various \xc2\xa73599(e) procedures do not apply to particular indigents, the term instead indicates the breadth of the representation contemplated.  The directive that counsel \xe2\x80\x9cshall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including \xe2\x80\xa6 all available post-conviction process,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, hardly suggests a limitation on the scope of representation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not expected to provide each service enumerated in subsection (e) for every client.  But that limitation does not follow from the word \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d; it follows from the word \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d and the organization of subsection (e) to mirror the ordinary course of proceedings for capital defendants.  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities commence at a different part of subsection (e) depending on whether she is appointed pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), or (a)(2).  When she is appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(A), she is charged with representing her client in all listed proceedings.  When she is appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(B) (<em>i.e</em>., after the entry of a federal death sentence), her representation begins with \xe2\x80\x9cappeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  And when she is appointed pursuant to (a)(2), her representation begins with the \xc2\xa72254 or \xc2\xa72255 \xe2\x80\x9cpost-conviction process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation includes only those judicial proceedings transpiring \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d to her appointment.  It is the sequential organization of the statute and the term \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d that circumscribe counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation, not a strict division between federal and state proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an attempt to overcome the plain language of \xc2\xa73599, the Government advances two additional arguments that merit discussion.  First, it contends that a literal reading of subsection (e) would lead to unacceptable results: It would require a federal lawyer who obtained relief for her client in \xc2\xa72254 proceedings to continue to represent him during his state retrial; similarly, it would require federal counsel to represent her client in any state habeas proceeding following her appointment.  Second, the Government claims that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history shows that Congress did not intend to include state clemency proceedings within \xc2\xa73599(e)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government suggests that reading \xc2\xa73599(e) to authorize federally funded counsel for state clemency proceedings would require a lawyer who succeeded in setting aside a state death sentence during postconviction proceedings to represent her client during an ensuing state retrial.  We do not read subsection (e) to apply to state-court proceedings that follow the issuance of a federal writ of habeas corpus.  When a retrial occurs after postconviction relief, it is not properly understood as a \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage\xe2\x80\x9d of judicial proceedings but rather as the commencement of new judicial proceedings.  Moreover, subsection (a)(2) provides for counsel only when a state petitioner is unable to obtain adequate representation.  States are constitutionally required to provide trial counsel for indigent defendants.  Thus, when a state prisoner\nis granted a new trial following \xc2\xa72254 proceedings, his state-furnished representation renders him ineligible for \xc2\xa73599 counsel until the commencement of new \xc2\xa72254 proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government likewise argues that our reading of \xc2\xa73599(e) would require federally funded counsel to represent her client in any state habeas proceeding occurring after her appointment because such proceedings are also \xe2\x80\x9cavailable post-conviction process.\xe2\x80\x9d  But as we have previously noted, subsection (e) authorizes counsel to represent her client in \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d stages of available judicial proceedings.  State habeas is not a stage \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d to federal habeas.  Just the opposite: Petitioners must exhaust their claims in state court before seeking federal habeas relief.  See \xc2\xa72254(b)(1).  That state postconviction litigation sometimes follows the initiation of federal habeas because a petitioner has failed to exhaust does not change the order of proceedings contemplated by the statute.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also argues that \xc2\xa73599(e) should not be interpreted as including state-clemency proceedings because it was drafted to apply only to federal defendants.  Section 3599 was originally enacted as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, \xc2\xa77001(b), 102 Stat. 4388 (codified at 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7848(q)(4)\xe2\x80\x93(10)), which created a federal capital offense of drug-related homicide.  In 2006, the death penalty procedures specified in that Act were repealed and recodified without change at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599.  Based on the 1988 legislative history, the Government argues that subsection (e) was not written to apply to state petitioners at all.  In its telling, the subsection was drafted when the bill covered only federal defendants; state litigants were added, by means of what is now subsection (a)(2), just a few hours before the bill passed in rushed end-of-session proceedings; and Congress simply did not attend to the fact that this amendment applied what is now subsection (e) to state litigants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the legislative history is regrettably thin, the evidence that is available does not support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  State petitioners were a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act from the first day the House of Representatives took up the bill.  In the amendment authorizing the death penalty for drug-related homicides, Representative George Gekas included a provision that closely resembles the current \xc2\xa73599(a)(2): \xe2\x80\x9cIn any post-conviction proceeding under <em>section 2254</em> or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, the court shall appoint counsel to represent any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  134 Cong. Rec. 22984 (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following passage of the Gekas amendment, Representative John Conyers proposed replacing its provisions on appellate and collateral process (including the above-quoted provision) with language comprising the provisions now codified at \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(a)(1), (b), (c), and (e).  Because his amendment introduced the \xc2\xa73599(e) language and did not refer specifically to \xc2\xa72254 proceedings, the Government and Justice Scalia argue that Representative Conyers drafted subsection (e) to apply only to federal defendants.  But his floor statements evince his particular concern for state prisoners.  He explained that his amendment filed a gap because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile State courts appoint lawyers for indigent defendants, there is no legal representation automatically provided once the case i[s] appealed to the Federal level.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id.</em>, at 22996.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  He then cited discussions by the Chief Judge of the Eleventh Circuit and the NAACP devoted exclusively to errors found by federal courts during habeas corpus review of state capital cases.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Senate, Representative Conyers\xe2\x80\x99 language was first replaced with Representative Gekas\xe2\x80\x99 provision for counsel for \xc2\xa72254 and \xc2\xa72255 petitioners, and then a subsequent amendment substituted the text of the Conyers amendment.  See <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>30401, 30746.  Thereafter, the House amended the bill a final time to insert the language now codified at \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) while leaving the Conyers language in place.  See <em>id.</em>, at 33215.  The Government argues that this late amendment marked the first occasion on which state prisoners were brought within the bill\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  But Representative Gekas\xe2\x80\x99 initial amendment explicitly referenced \xc2\xa72254 petitioners, and Representative Conyers\xe2\x80\x99 proposal sought to provide additional protections for all capital defendants.  The House\xe2\x80\x99s final amendment is therefore best understood not as altering the bill\xe2\x80\x99s scope, but as clarifying it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s history and purposes are laced with the suggestion that Congress simply would not have intended to fund clemency counsel for indigent state prisoners because clemency proceedings are a matter of grace entirely distinct from judicial proceedings.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  As this Court has recognized, however, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]lemency is deeply rooted in our Anglo-American tradition of law, and is the historic remedy for preventing miscarriages of justice where judicial process has been exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herrera</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/390/index.html">506 U. S. 390</a>, 411\xe2\x80\x93412 (1993) (footnote omitted).  Far from regarding clemency as a matter of mercy alone, we have called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98fail safe\xe2\x80\x99 in our criminal justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 415.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to furnish counsel for clemency proceedings demonstrates that it, too, recognized the importance of such process to death-sentenced prisoners, and its reference to \xe2\x80\x9cother clemency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73599(e), shows that it was familiar with the availability of state as well as federal clemency proceedings.  Moreover, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 sequential enumeration suggests an awareness that clemency proceedings are not as divorced from judicial proceedings as the Government submits.  Subsection (e) emphasizes continuity of counsel, and Congress likely appreciated that federal habeas counsel are well positioned to represent their clients in the state clemency proceedings that typically follow the conclusion of \xc2\xa72254 litigation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, as the history of this case demonstrates, the work of competent counsel during habeas corpus representation may provide the basis for a persuasive clemency application.  Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s federally appointed counsel developed extensive information about his life history and cognitive impairments that was not presented during his trial or appeals.  She also litigated a claim under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), based on police records that had been suppressed for 14 years.  One Court of Appeals judge concluded that the nondisclosure of these records \xe2\x80\x9cundermine[d] confidence in Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict\xe2\x80\x9d because the evidence contained therein could have supported a colorable defense that a third party murdered the victim and that Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s codefendant falsely implicated him.  408 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 840 (Clay, J., dissenting).  Although the Court of Appeals concluded that Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Brady </em>claim was procedurally defaulted, the information contained in the police records could be marshaled together with information about Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s background in a clemency application to the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole and the Governor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Harbison\xe2\x80\x99s case underscores why it is \xe2\x80\x9centirely plausible that Congress did not want condemned men and women to be abandoned by their counsel at the last moment and left to navigate the sometimes labyrinthine clemency process from their jail cells.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hain </em>v. <em>Mullin</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168 (CA10 2006) (en banc).

It is clear, for example, that a state inmate faced with an imminent execution might be required to apply for a stay from a state court before seeking such relief in a federal court.  On our reading of the statute, federally appointed counsel would be permitted to represent her client pursuant to subsection (e)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9capplications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  But on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, the inmate would have to secure new counsel to file the stay request because his federal counsel would not be authorized to represent him.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) entitles indigent federal habeas petitioners to appointed counsel \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d subsection (e).  Subsection (e) specifies that the appointed counsel \xe2\x80\x9cshall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 and shall also represent the defendant in such \xe2\x80\xa6 proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in the text of \xc2\xa73599(e) excludes proceedings for available <em>state</em> clemency, and, as the Court points out, there are good reasons to expect federal habeas counsel to carry on through state clemency proceedings.  See<em> ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, the \xe2\x80\x9cplain language of \xc2\xa73599,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8, does not fully resolve this case.  The obligation in subsection (e) that the appointed counsel represent the defendant in \xe2\x80\x9cevery subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d is not on its face limited to \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings, just as there is no such limitation with respect to clemency.  Yet it is highly unlikely that Congress intended federal habeas petitioners to keep their federal counsel during subsequent state judicial proceedings.  See <em>Hain</em> v. <em>Mullin</em>, 436 F.\xc2\xa03d 1168, 1178 (CA10 2006) (Briscoe, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t cannot seriously be suggested that Congress intended, in the event a state capital prisoner obtains federal habeas relief and is granted a new trial, to provide federally-funded counsel to represent that prisoner in the ensuing state trial, appellate, and post-conviction proceedings\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Harbison concedes as much.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 11\xe2\x80\x9312; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\xe2\x80\x936, 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If there were no way to read the words of the statute to avoid this problematic result, I might be forced to accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to insert the word \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d into \xc2\xa73599(e)\xe2\x80\x94a limitation that would have to apply to clemency as well.  But fortunately the best reading of the statute avoids the problem: Section 3599(e)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage[s] of available judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d does not include state judicial proceedings after federal habeas, because those are more properly regarded as new judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The meaning of that phrase is not entirely plain, but it is plain that not every lawsuit involving an inmate that arises after the federal habeas proceeding is included.  Surely \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d do not include, for example, a challenge to prison conditions or a suit for divorce in state court, even if these available judicial proceedings occur subsequent to federal habeas.  That must be because these are new proceedings rather than \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of the proceedings for which federal counsel is available.  Once it is acknowledged that Congress has drawn a line at some point, this is the \xe2\x80\x9cbest reading\xe2\x80\x9d of the statutory language. <em> Post</em>, at 3 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas does not disagree.  Instead, he contends that it is not necessary to decide what the first part of the sentence means in deciding what the second part means.  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not \xe2\x80\xa6 construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/822/index.html">467 U.

This certainly applies to reading sentences as a whole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I entirely agree with Justice Thomas that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 intent is found in the words it has chosen to use,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur task is to apply the text, not to improve upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d even if that produces \xe2\x80\x9cvery bad policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 3<em> </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).

The majority and dissent read such a limitation into subsection (a)(1) of the statute.

The dissent seizes on this inconsistency between the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), but responds by incorrectly reading a parallel \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d limitation into subsection (a)(2), see <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cit is perfectly reasonable to assume\xe2\x80\x9d that subsection (a)(2) is limited to federal postconviction proceedings\xe2\x80\x94including clemency proceedings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceven where the statute contains no such express limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, in contrast, finds a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d limitation in a clause of subsection (e) that is not before this Court in order to cabin the reach of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  He observes that the text of subsection (e) includes no \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d limitation with respect to any of the proceedings listed in that subsection.  But The Chief Justice finds a way to avoid this \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic result\xe2\x80\x9d by adding a different limitation to \xc2\xa73599.  In his view, the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage[s] of available judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d is one that excludes \xe2\x80\x9cstate judicial proceedings after federal habeas\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings because they are \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94judicial proceedings.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.

Nor should this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to statutory construction be influenced by the supposition that \xe2\x80\x9cit is highly unlikely that Congress intended\xe2\x80\x9d a given result.  See <em>ante, </em>at 1 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent is found in the words it has chosen to use.  See <em>West Virginia Univ.

And Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence certainly does not empower us to go even farther and incorporate such an assumption into the text of these provisions.  <em>Post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Moreover, the Court should not decide a question irrelevant to this case in order to pre-empt the \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d results that might arise from a plain-text reading of the statutory provision under review.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  Whether or not The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d clause of subsection (e) is correct, it is irrelevant to the proper interpretation of the clemency clause of subsection (e).  Even if the statute were to authorize federal postconviction counsel to appear in state proceedings other than state clemency proceedings, a question not resolved by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, that conclusion would not provide a legitimate basis for adopting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s atextual interpretation of the clemency clause of subsection (e).  The \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of the clemency clause does not turn on the unresolved breadth of the \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, the Court must adopt the interpretation of the statute that is most faithful to its text.  Here, the absence of a \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d limitation in the text of subsections (a) and (e) of \xc2\xa73599 most logically suggests that these provisions are not limited to federal clemency proceedings.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.  It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might think is the preferred result.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72253(c)(1)(A) before appealing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his motion to expand counsel\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  I do not agree, however, that 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599 gives state prisoners federally funded counsel to pursue state clemency.  While purporting to adopt a \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward reading of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em> at 5, the Court in fact selectively amends the statute\xe2\x80\x94inserting words in some places, twisting their meaning elsewhere.  Because the statute is most naturally and coherently read to provide federally funded counsel to capital defendants appearing in a federal forum, I would affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit and hold that Harbison was not entitled to federally funded counsel to pursue state clemency.  </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) provides for the appointment of counsel as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIn any post conviction proceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSection 3599(e) defines the scope of appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUnless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s own motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appointed shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures, and shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, the first of these provisions entitled Harbison to counsel for \xc2\xa72254 proceedings.  And the second of them, without any express qualification, provides for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s continued representation through \xe2\x80\x9csuch . . . proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d which in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case would include state clemency proceedings.  The Court thus concludes that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain language\xe2\x80\x9d provides Harbison federally funded counsel to represent him in state clemency proceedings.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Court quickly abandons its allegedly \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d reading of the statute when it confronts the subsection that precedes these two, which provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in every criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime which may be punishable by death, a defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at any time either\xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) before judgment; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) after the entry of a judgment imposing a\nsentence of death but before the execution of that judgment; </p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in accordance with subsections (b) through (f).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(a)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">The Court states that \xe2\x80\x9c(a)(1) describes federal capital defendants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 4.  But according to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s mode of analysis, that is not so.  Subsection (a)(1), like subsection (e), contains no language limiting its application to <em>federal</em> capital defendants.  It provides counsel to indigent defendants in \xe2\x80\x9c<em>every</em> criminal action in which a defendant is charged with a crime which may be punishable by death.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Why, then, is subsection (a)(1) limited to <em>federal </em>capital defendants?  Because, as the Court notes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute is primarily concerned with federal criminal actions and (a)(1) includes no language suggesting that it applies more broadly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite right.  Section 3599 was enacted as part of a bill that created a new federal capital offense, see <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa03, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that a <em>federal</em> statute, providing <em>federally</em> funded counsel, applies in <em>federal</em> proceedings only, even where the statute contains no such express limitation.  Cf. <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, 7 Pet. 243, 247\xe2\x80\x93248 (1833).  But there is no basis for adopting that reading with respect to only <em>half</em> the statute.  If subsection (a)(1) is limited to federal proceedings, then subsection (e), which likewise contains no express federal limitation, is similarly limited.  We cannot give the same silence (omission of the limiting word \xe2\x80\x9cfederal\xe2\x80\x9d) in adjacent and simultaneously enacted subsections of the same law (\xc2\xa73599) divergent meanings.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court advances two arguments for reading subsection (e) more broadly.  First, it claims that unlike subsection (a)(1), \xe2\x80\x9csubsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  It most certainly does not.  It refers to <em>proceedings</em> under \xc2\xa72254 and \xc2\xa72255\xe2\x80\x94proceedings under <em>federal</em> statutes providing <em>federal</em> causes of action in <em>federal</em> court.  Read together, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) provide federally funded counsel for persons convicted of capital crimes who are appearing in federal court.  Subsection (a)(2) neither undermines the Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s primary focus is federal\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings, nor gives the Court license to insert words selectively into the statutory text.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court next reasons that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive or <em>other</em> clemency\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that subsection (e) includes state clemency proceedings.  Since (the argument goes) federal clemency is exclusively executive, the word \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to state clemency, or else it would be superfluous.  But the drafting history, which the Court thinks relevant, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, defeats the inference the Court wishes to draw.  The current text of subsection (e) first appeared in a version of the bill that included what is now subsection (a)(1) (which the Court concedes deals only with federal proceedings), but <em>not</em> subsection (a)(2) (which the Court would deem applicable to state proceedings).  134 Cong. Rec. 22995 (1988).  In other words, at the time of its introduction, subsection (e) applied only to federal defendants, and the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cor other clemency\xe2\x80\x9d was unquestionably superfluous. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading places a great deal of weight on avoiding superfluity in a statute that is already teeming with superfluity.  Item: Subsection (a)(2) needlessly refers to \xc2\xa72255 proceedings even though subsections (a)(1) and (e) taken together would provide federal capital defendants with counsel in \xc2\xa72255 proceedings.  Item: Subsection (a)(2) provides counsel \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with subsections (b) through (f)\xe2\x80\x9d even though subsections (b) and (c) have no conceivable relevance to subsection (a)(2).*<footcall num="*">  Item: Subsection (e) provides counsel \xe2\x80\x9cthroughout every subsequent stage of <em>available</em> judicial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9call <em>available</em> post-conviction process\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  The first use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d is already of dubious value (is counsel expected to represent a defendant in <em>unavailable</em> proceedings?) but its needless repetition is inexplicable.  In a statute that is such a paragon of shoddy draftsmanship, relying upon the superfluity of \xe2\x80\x9cor other\xe2\x80\x9d to extend the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application from federal to state proceedings is quite absurd\xe2\x80\x94and doubly absurd when that extension is illogically limited to the subsection in which \xe2\x80\x9cor other\xe2\x80\x9d appears.</footcall></p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of subsection (e) faces a second substantial difficulty.  Subsection (e) provides that counsel, once appointed, </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cshall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available post-conviction process, together with applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d   \xc2\xa73599(e).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, once counsel is appointed under (a)(2), petitioner is entitled to federal counsel \xe2\x80\x9cthroughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government argues that, if subsection (e) is not limited to federal proceedings, then a \xc2\xa72254 petitioner who obtains federally funded counsel will retain that counsel, at federal expense, in all \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d state-court proceedings, including the retrial that follows the grant of federal habeas relief.  The Court disagrees, on the ground that a new trial represents the \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement of new judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I need not enter that controversy.  What is clear, at least, is that (if subsection (e) includes state proceedings) federally funded counsel would have to represent petitioners in subsequent state habeas proceedings.  The Court tries to split the baby here, conceding that \xe2\x80\x9ca district court may determine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropriate for federal counsel to exhaust [in state court] a claim in the course of her federal habeas representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, n.\xc2\xa07.  The Court tries to derive this discretionary authority from subsection (e)\xe2\x80\x99s provision for representation by federal counsel in \xe2\x80\x9cother <em>appropriate</em> motions and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73599(e) (emphasis added).  But that provision is <em>in addition to</em>, rather than <em>in limitation of</em>, subsection (e)\xe2\x80\x99s unqualified<em> </em>statement that counsel \xe2\x80\x9cshall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, including \xe2\x80\xa6 all available post-conviction process.\xe2\x80\x9d  The provision then continues: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>together with</em> applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  There is no way in which this can be read to limit the requirement that counsel represent the defendant in \xe2\x80\x9cevery subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d which would include habeas proceedings in state court.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion by saying that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate habeas is not a stage \xe2\x80\x98subsequent\xe2\x80\x99 to federal habeas,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[p]etitioners must exhaust their claims in state court before seeking federal habeas relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  This is a breathtaking denial of reality, confusing what <em>should be </em>with what <em>is</em>.  It is rather like saying that murder does not exist because the law forbids it.  To be sure, petitioners are <em>supposed to</em> complete state postconviction proceedings before pursuing relief in federal court.  But they often do not do so, and when they do not our opinions permit them to seek stays or dismissals of their \xc2\xa72254 petitions in order that they may thereafter <em>(subsequently) </em>return to state court to exhaust their claims.  See <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U. S. 269</a>, 277\xe2\x80\x93278 (2005); <em>Pliler</em> v. <em>Ford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/225/index.html">542 U. S. 225</a>, 228 (2004).  Additionally, inmates may\xe2\x80\x94as petitioner did in this case\xe2\x80\x94file successive state habeas petitions after \xc2\xa72254 proceedings are complete.  See <em>Harbison</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. E2004\xe2\x80\x9300885\xe2\x80\x93CCA\xe2\x80\x93R28\xe2\x80\x93PD, 2005 WL 1521910, *1 (Tenn. Crim. App., June 27, 2005).  These subsequent state proceedings are not rare but commonplace, and it is inconceivable (if state proceedings are covered) that subsection (e) does not refer to them.  Indeed, one would think that subsection (e) refers especially to them.  And what kind of an incoherent statute would it be that allows counsel for <em>de-facto</em>-subsequent federal habeas claims that <em>should have been</em> brought earlier (see \xc2\xa73599(a)(2)) but does not allow counsel for subsequent state habeas claims that have the same defect?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If \xc2\xa73599(e) includes state proceedings (as the Court holds), and if \xe2\x80\x9csubsequent\xe2\x80\x9d is given its proper scope (rather than the tortured one adopted by the Court)\xe2\x80\x94then \xc2\xa73599(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of federally provided counsel to only <em>federal</em> habeas proceedings would amount to a dead letter.  A capital convict could file for federal habeas without first exhausting state postconviction remedies, obtain a stay or dismissal of that federal petition, and return to state court along with his federally funded lawyer.  Indeed, under our decision in <em>McFarland</em> v. <em>Scott</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/849/index.html">512 U. S. 849</a> (1994), he need not even file an unexhausted federal habeas petition; he can file a stand-alone \xe2\x80\x9cmotion requesting the appointment of habeas counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 859, and obtain federally funded counsel that he can then take back for the subsequent state proceedings.  The question persists: Why would \xc2\xa73599(a)(2) provide counsel in only <em>federal</em> habeas proceedings, when \xc2\xa73599(e) makes it so easy to obtain federally funded counsel for <em>state </em>habeas proceedings as well?</p>\n<p align="left">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS Western">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*<f f="Arial Unicode MS Western">\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83<f f="Century Schoolbook">*</f></f></f></f></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concededly, \xc2\xa73599 contains no express language limiting its application to proceedings in a federal forum.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to extend that limitation to the entirety of \xc2\xa73599 is untenable.  It lacks a textual basis and has the additional misfortune of producing absurd results, which the majority attempts to avoid by doing further violence to the statutory text.  I would read the statute as providing federal counsel to capital convicts appearing in a federal forum, and I accordingly would affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Subsection (b) details the requisite qualifications for a lawyer appointed \xe2\x80\x9cbefore judgment\xe2\x80\x9d; but appointments under subsection (a)(2) are made only after judgment.
