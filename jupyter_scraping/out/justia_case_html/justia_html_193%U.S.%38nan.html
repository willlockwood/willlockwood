The objects of the association, as stated in the constitution thereof, were to unite all acceptable dealers in tiles, fireplace fixtures, and mantels in San Francisco and vicinity (within a radius of 200 miles) and all American manufacturers of tiles, and by frequent interchange of ideas, advance the interests and promote the mutual welfare of its members.</p>\n<p>By its constitution, article I, section 1, it was provided that any individual, corporation, or firm engaged in or contemplating engaging in the tile, mantel, or grate business in San Francisco or within a radius of 200 miles thereof (not manufacturers), having an established business and carrying not less than $3,000 worth of stock, and having been proposed by a member in good standing and elected, should, after having signed the constitution and bylaws governing the association, and upon the payment of an entrance fee as provided, enjoy all the privileges of membership.

The initiation fee was, for active members, $25, and for nonresident members $10, and each active member of the association was to pay $10 per year as dues, but no dues were charged against nonresidents.</p>\n<p>An executive committee was to be appointed whose duty it was to examine all applications for membership in the association and report on the same to the association.  It does not appear what vote was necessary to elect a member, but it is alleged in the complaint that it required the unanimous consent of the association to become a member thereof, and it was further alleged that, by reason of certain business difficulties, there were members of the association who were antagonistic to plaintiffs, and who would not have permitted them to join if they had applied, and that plaintiffs were not eligible to join the association for the further reason that they did not carry at all times stock of the value of $3,000.</p>\n<p>The bylaws, after providing for the settlement of disputes between the members and their customers, by reason of liens, foreclosure proceedings, etc., enacted as follows, in article III:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 7.

S. 44</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question raised by the plaintiffs in error in this case is whether this association, described in the foregoing statement of facts, constituted or amounted to an agreement or combination in restraint of trade within the meaning of the so-called Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890.</p>\n<p>The result of the agreement when carried out was to prevent the dealer in tiles in San Francisco, who was not a member of the association, from purchasing or procuring the same upon any terms from any of the manufacturers who were such members, and all of those manufacturers who had been accustomed to sell to the plaintiffs were members.  The nonmember </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 193 U. S. 45</a></p><p> dealer was also prevented by the agreement from buying tiles of a dealer in San Francisco who was a member, excepting at a greatly enhanced price over what he would have paid to the manufacturer or to any San Francisco dealer who was a member, if he, the purchaser, were also a member of the association.  The agreement therefore restrained trade, for it narrowed the market for the sale of tile in California from the manufacturers and dealers therein in other states, so that they could only be sold to the members of the association, and it enhanced prices to the nonmember as already stated.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs endeavored in vain to procure tile for the purposes of their business from these tile manufacturers, but the latter refused to deal with them because plaintiffs were not members of the association.  It is not the simple case of manufacturers of an article of commerce between the several states refusing to sell to certain other persons.  The agreement is between manufacturers and dealers belonging to an association in which the dealers agree not to purchase from manufacturers not members of the association, and not to sell unset tile to any one not a member of the association for less than list prices, which are more than fifty percent higher than the prices would be to those who were members, while the manufacturers who became members agreed not to sell to anyone not a member, and in case of a violation of the agreement they were subject to forfeiting their membership.  By reason of this agreement, therefore, the market for tile is, as we have said, not only narrowed, but the prices charged by the San Francisco dealers for the unset tile to those not members of the association are more than doubled.  It is urged that the sale of unset tile, provided for in the seventh section of the bylaws, is a transaction wholly within the State of California and is not, in any event, a violation of the act of Congress which applies only to commerce between the states.  The provision as to this sale is but a part of the agreement, and it is so united with the rest as to be incapable of separation without at the same time altering the general purpose of the agreement.  The whole agreement is to be construed as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 193 U. S. 46</a></p><p> one piece, in which the manufacturers are parties as well as the San Francisco dealers, and the refusal to sell on the part of the manufacturers is connected with and a part of the scheme which includes the enhancement of the price of the unset tile by the San Francisco dealers.  The whole thing is so bound together that, when looked at as a whole. the sale of unset tile ceases to be a mere transaction in the State of California, and becomes part of a purpose which, when carried out, amounts to and is a contract or combination in restraint of interstate trade or commerce.</p>\n<p>Again, it is contended the sale of unset tile is so small in San Francisco as to be a negligible quantity; that it does not amount to one percent of the business of the dealers in tile in that city.  The amount of trade in the commodity is not very material, but even though such dealing heretofore has been small, it would probably largely increase when those who formerly purchased tile from the manufacturers are shut out by reason of the association and their nonmembership therein from purchasing their tile from those manufacturers, and are compelled to purchase them from the San Francisco dealers.  Either the extent of the trade in unset tile would increase between the members of the association and outsiders or else the latter would have to go out of business because unable to longer compete with their rivals who were members.  In either event, the combination, if carried out, directly effects a restraint of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>It is also contended that, as the expressed object of the association was to unite therein all the dealers in San Francisco and vicinity, the plaintiffs had nothing more to do than join the association, pay their fees and dues, and become like one of the other members.  It was not, however, a matter of course to permit any dealer to join.  The constitution only provided for "all acceptable dealers" joining the association.  As plaintiffs were not invited to be among its founders, it would look as if they were not regarded as acceptable.  However that may be, they never, subsequently to its formation, applied for admission.  It is plain that the question of their admission, if they had so applied, was one to be arbitrarily </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 193 U. S. 47</a></p><p> determined by the association.  The constitution provided for the appointment of an executive committee, whose duty it was to examine all applications for membership in and to report on the same to the association, after which it was to decide whether the applicants should be admitted or not.  If they were not acceptable, the applicant would not be admitted, and whether they were or not was a matter for the arbitrary decision of the association.  Its decision that they were not acceptable was sufficient to bar their entrance.</p>\n<p>Again, it appears that plaintiffs were not eligible under the constitution because they did not always carry stock worth $3,000, which, by section 1 of article I, was made a condition of eligibility to membership.  True, it was stated in evidence that this provision had not been enforced, but there was no averment or proof that it had been repealed, and there was nothing to prevent its enforcement at any time that an application was made by anyone who could not come up to the condition.  The case stands, therefore, that the plaintiffs had not been asked to join the association at its formation; that they did not fill the condition provided for in its constitution as to eligibility, and that, if they had applied, their application was subject to arbitrary rejection.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs, however, could not, by virtue of any agreement contained in such association, be legally put under obligation to become members in order to enable them to transact their business as they had theretofore done, and to purchase tile as they had been accustomed to do before the association was formed.</p>\n<p>The consequences of nonmembership were grave, if not disastrous, to the plaintiffs.  It has already been shown how the prices of tile were enhanced so far as plaintiffs were concerned, and how, by means of this combination, interstate commerce was affected.</p>\n<p>The purchase and sale of tile between the manufacturers in one state and dealers therein in California was interstate commerce within the <em>Addystone Pipe</em> case, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/175/211/case.html">175 U. S. 211</a></span>.  It was not a combination or monopoly among manufacturers simply, but one between them and dealers in the manufactured article, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="48">Page 193 U. S. 48</a></p><p> which was an article of commerce between the states.  <em>United States v. E. C. Knight Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/156/1/case.html">156 U. S. 1</a></span>, did not, therefore, cover it.  It is not brought within either <em>Hopkins v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/171/578/case.html">171 U. S. 578</a></span>, or <em>Anderson v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/171/604/case.html">171 U. S. 604</a></span>.  In the first case it was held that the occupation of the members of the association was not interstate commerce, and in the other that the subject matter of the agreement did not directly relate to, embrace, or act upon interstate commerce, for the reasons which are therein stated at length.  Upon examination, we think it is entirely clear that the facts in the case at bar bear no resemblance to the facts set forth in either of the above cases and are not within the reasoning of either.  The agreement directly affected and restrained interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The case we regard as a plain one and it is unnecessary to further enlarge upon it.</p>\n<p>There is one other question which, although of secondary importance, is raised by the plaintiffs in error.  After the rendition of the verdict the plaintiffs below claimed a reasonable attorney\'s fee under the seventh section of the act, and made proof of what would be a reasonable sum therefor, from which it appeared that it would be from $750 to $1,000.  The trial court awarded to the plaintiffs $750.  The verdict being only for $500, the plaintiffs in error claimed that the allowance was an improper and unreasonable one.  The trial took some five days.  The judgment in effect pronounced the association illegal.  The amount of the attorney\'s fee was within the discretion of the trial court, reasonably exercised, and we do not think that in this case such discretion was abused.</p>\n<p>The judgment is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
