The debt being under ten pounds, the Plaintiff, in his own name, sued the father before the Justice upon this assignment, and obtained a judgment and execution against him; although, as it was stated in the Defendant\'s deposition, his daughter was of full age at the time of contracting the debt, and no assumption, upon his part, had been proved or suggested. </p><p> Bradford moved to reverse the Judgment; 1st, on account of the general irregularity of the proceedings; and 2ndly, because an action could not be maintained, by the assignee of a simple contract debt, in his own name. </p><p> The Court considered the whole proceedings to have been irregular; but said, that there could be no doubt of the sufficiency of the second reason alone, as a ground for setting them aside.
