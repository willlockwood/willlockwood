United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/948/case.html">464 U.S. 948</a> (1983) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and remain convinced that this Court should resolve it. </p><p> Whether the Eighth Circuit belongs in the above list is in some doubt in light of the second of these petitions. The petitioner in No. 84-605 was convicted of extortion. The critical evidence was testimony by the victim about threatening phone calls he received from petitioner\'s co- conspirator. The District Court first admitted the statements conditionally, then, after the close of evidence, ruled that they were admissible. The Court of Appeals found that the statements were properly admitted. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/736/1222/">736 F.2d 1222</a> (1984). The court stated that the existence of a conspiracy must be established by independent evidence. Yet it relied on one of the threatening phone calls, this one from an uncertain source, to establish the date that the conspiracy had begun. Id., at 1229. Petitioner argues, with some force, that this use of the hearsay statement is inconsistent with the prevailing requirement of independent evidence. </p><p> The petitioner also raises two other issues as to which there is some division among the lower courts. First, he objects to the timing of the ruling on admissibility, arguing that admissibility should be established at a pretrial hearing rather than at the close of evidence. Second, he notes the existence of a conflict as to the standard of proof by which the conspiracy must be established. The majority position requires a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Ammar, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/714/238/">714 F.2d 238</a>, 249-251 (CA3), cert. denied sub nom. Stillman v.

Other courts require only substantial evidence, United States v. Jackson, supra, at 233-234, 627 F.2d, at 1219-1220; United States v. James, supra, at 580-581; United States v. Monaco, supra, at 876-880; or a prima facie case, United States v. Dixon, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/562/1138/">562 F.2d 1138</a>, 1141 (CA9 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 927 ( 1978); United States v. Metz, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/608/147/">608 F.2d 147</a>, 153-154 (CA5 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 821 (1980). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1061">Page 469 U.S. 1058 , 1061</a></p><p> The timing issue does not merit our review. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] The question of the standard of proof does, but neither of these cases would be an appropriate vehicle as in each the Court of Appeals applied the most stringent alternative. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] These cases are nonetheless reminders of the continuing confusion about the administration of the co-conspirator exception-a confusion that, I think, we will eventually have to settle. </p><p> The critical question is whether a court may rely on challenged hearsay statements to determine whether the factual predicate for their admission exists. This Court has consistently denied certiorari in cases from the Sixth Circuit raising this issue. Vinson v. United States, 444 U.S. 1074 (1980); Arnott v. United States, supra; Shoun v. United States, 465 U.S. 1012 (1984); Piccolo v. United States, 466 U.S. 970, 80 L. Ed.2d 817 (1984). The conflict shows no sign of disappearing, and I remain convinced that this Court should resolve it. </p><p> I dissent from the Court\'s denial of certiorari in these two cases. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> The petitions do not raise a fourth issue that has split the Courts of Appeals, viz., whether a co-conspirator\'s statement that is admissible under the Federal Rules automatically satisfies the requirements of the Confrontation Clause of the Constitution. See Sanson v. United States, 467 U.S. 1264, 1265 ( 1984) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); see generally United States v.
