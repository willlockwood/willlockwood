Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPrebate\xe2\x80\x9d program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to return empty cartridges to the company.  Each Prebate cartridge has a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark replaces the chip.  Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed a microchip that mimicked Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s.  Lexmark sued for copyright infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of \xc2\xa743(a) of the Lanham Act, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71125(a), and that its misrepresentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its business reputation.  The District Court held that Static Control lacked \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing\xe2\x80\x9d to bring the Lanham Act claim, applying a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, \n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519\n.

To decide that question, this Court must determine the provision\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation.  It is misleading to label this a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing\xe2\x80\x9d question.  Lexmark bases its \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing\xe2\x80\x9d arguments on Associated General Contractors, but that case rested on statutory considerations: The Court sought to \xe2\x80\x9cascertain,\xe2\x80\x9d as a statutory-interpretation matter, the \xe2\x80\x9cscope of the private remedy created by\xe2\x80\x9d Congress in \xc2\xa74 of the Clayton Act, and the \xe2\x80\x9cclass of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under\xe2\x80\x9d that legislatively conferred cause of action, 459 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529, 532.  And while this Court may have placed the \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d test that Static Control relies on under the \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, it does not belong there any more than Associated General Contractors does.  Rather, whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests requires the Court to determine, using traditional statutory-interpretation tools, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, and n.\xc2\xa02.

Wright, \n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 737\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he breadth of [that] zone .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. varies according to the provisions of law at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bennett v. Spear, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154\n.  The Lanham Act includes a detailed statement of its purposes, including, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cprotect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control of Congress] against unfair competition,\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71127; and \xe2\x80\x9cunfair competition\xe2\x80\x9d was understood at common law to be concerned with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.  Thus, to come within the zone of interests in a \xc2\xa71125(a) false-advertising suit, a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.  See, e.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, \n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n\xe2\x80\x93270.  This requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo remote\xe2\x80\x9d from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful conduct, such as when the harm is purely derivative of \xe2\x80\x9cmisfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 268\xe2\x80\x93269.  In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising.  But since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries, the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proximate-cause showing the statute requires.  Cf. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co., \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 639\n.  Thus, a plaintiff suing under \xc2\xa71125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.

These principles provide better guidance than the multifactor balancing test urged by Lexmark, the direct-competitor test, or the reasonable-interest test applied by the Sixth Circuit.

Background\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLexmark manufactures and sells laser printers.  It also sells toner cartridges for those printers (toner being the powdery ink that laser printers use to create images on paper).  Lexmark designs its printers to work only with its own style of cartridges, and it therefore dominates the market for cartridges compatible with its printers.  That market, however, is not devoid of competitors.  Other businesses, called \xe2\x80\x9cremanufacturers,\xe2\x80\x9d acquire used Lex- mark toner cartridges, refurbish them, and sell them in competition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by Lexmark.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLexmark would prefer that its customers return their empty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale, rather than sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer.  So Lexmark introduced what it called a \xe2\x80\x9cPrebate\xe2\x80\x9d program, which enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges at a 20-percent discount if they would agree to return the cartridge to Lexmark once it was empty.  Those terms were communicated to consumers through notices printed on the toner-cartridge boxes, which advised the consumer that opening the box would indicate assent to the terms\xe2\x80\x94a practice commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9cshrinkwrap licensing,\xe2\x80\x9d see, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.\xc2\xa03d 1447, 1449 (CA7 1996).  To enforce the Prebate terms, Lexmark included a microchip in each Prebate cartridge that would disable the cartridge after it ran out of toner; for the cartridge to be used again, the microchip would have to be replaced by Lexmark.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStatic Control is not itself a manufacturer or remanufacturer of toner cartridges.  It is, rather, \xe2\x80\x9cthe market leader [in] making and selling the components necessary to remanufacture Lexmark cartridges.\xe2\x80\x9d  697 F.\xc2\xa03d 387, 396 (CA6 2012) (case below).  In addition to supplying remanufacturers with toner and various replacement parts, Static Control developed a microchip that could mimic the microchip in Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s Prebate cartridges.  By purchasing Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s microchips and using them to replace the Lexmark microchip, remanufacturers were able to refurbish and resell used Prebate cartridges.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLexmark did not take kindly to that development.  In 2002, it sued Static Control, alleging that Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s microchips violated both the Copyright Act of 1976, \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101 et\xc2\xa0seq., and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71201 et\xc2\xa0seq.  Static Control counterclaimed, alleging, among other things, violations of \xc2\xa743(a) of the Lanham Act, \n\n60Stat.\n441, codified at \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71125(a).

See Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F.\xc2\xa02d 1093, 1108 (CA9 1992).

First, it alleged that through its Prebate program Lexmark \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully misleads end-users\xe2\x80\x9d to believe that they are legally bound by the Prebate terms and are thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge to Lexmark after a single use.  App. 31, \xc2\xb639.  Second, it alleged that upon introducing the Prebate program, Lexmark \xe2\x80\x9csent letters to most of the companies in the toner cartridge remanufacturing business\xe2\x80\x9d falsely advising those companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished Prebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to use Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s products to refurbish those cartridges.  Id., at 29, \xc2\xb635.  Static Control asserted that by those statements, Lexmark had materially misrepresented \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature, characteristics, and qualities\xe2\x80\x9d of both its own products and Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s products.  Id., at 43\xe2\x80\x9344, \xc2\xb685.  It further maintained that Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations had \xe2\x80\x9cproximately caused and [we]re likely to cause injury to [Static Control] by diverting sales from [Static Control] to Lexmark,\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially injured [its] business reputation\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cleading consumers and others in the trade to believe that [Static Control] is engaged in illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 44, \xc2\xb688.

It held that Static Control lacked \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing\xe2\x80\x9d to bring that claim, App. to Pet. for Cert. 83, relying on a multifactor balancing test it attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, \n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 519 (1983)\n.  The court emphasized that there were \xe2\x80\x9cmore direct plaintiffs in the form of remanufacturers of Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s cartridges\xe2\x80\x9d; that Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s injury was \xe2\x80\x9cremot[e]\xe2\x80\x9d because it was a mere \xe2\x80\x9cbyproduct of the supposed manipulation of consumers\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with remanufacturers\xe2\x80\x9d; and that Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9calleged intent [was] to dry up spent cartridge supplies at the remanufacturing level, rather than at [Static Control]\xe2\x80\x99s supply level, making remanufacturers Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s alleged intended target.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 83.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal of Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s Lanham Act claim.  697 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 423.

The Sixth Circuit applied the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable-interest test and concluded that Static Control had standing because it \xe2\x80\x9calleged a cognizable interest in its business reputation and sales to remanufacturers and sufficiently alleged that th[o]se interests were harmed by Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the remanufacturers that Static Control was engaging in illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  697 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 411.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari to decide \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriate ana- lytical framework for determining a party\xe2\x80\x99s standing to maintain an action for false advertising under the Lanham Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i; 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ____ (2013).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII. \xe2\x80\x9cPrudential Standing\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs treat the question on which we granted certiorari as one of \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because we think that label misleading, we begin by clarifying the nature of the question at issue in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFrom Article III\xe2\x80\x99s limitation of the judicial power to resolving \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies,\xe2\x80\x9d and the separation-of-powers principles underlying that limitation, we have deduced a set of requirements that together make up the \xe2\x80\x9cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lujan v.

Later decisions confirm that Associated General Contractors rested on statutory, not \xe2\x80\x9cprudential,\xe2\x80\x9d considerations.  See, e.g., Holmes v.

Although we admittedly have placed that test under the \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove, supra, at 12, it does not belong there any more than Associated General Contractors does.  Whether a plain- tiff comes within \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98zone of interests\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is an issue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, and n.\xc2\xa02 (1998); Clarke v.

Circuit recently observed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prudential standing\xe2\x80\x99 is a misnomer\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to the zone-of-interests analysis, which asks whether \xe2\x80\x9cthis particular class of persons ha[s] a right to sue under this substantive statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Association of Battery Recyclers, Inc. v. EPA, 716 F.\xc2\xa03d 667, 675\xe2\x80\x93676 (2013) (concurring opinion).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, the question this case presents is whether Static Control falls within the class of plaintiffs whom Congress has authorized to sue under \xc2\xa71125(a).  In other words, we ask whether Static Control has a cause of action under the statute.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That question requires us to determine the meaning of the congressionally enacted provision creating a cause of action.  In doing so, we apply traditional principles of statutory interpretation.  We do not ask whether in our judgment Congress should have authorized Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s suit, but whether Congress in fact did so.  Just as a court cannot apply its independent policy judgment to recognize a cause of action that Congress has denied, see Alexander v. Sandoval, \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 275\n\xe2\x80\x93287 (2001), it cannot limit a cause of action that Congress has created merely because \xe2\x80\x9cprudence\xe2\x80\x9d dictates.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII. Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s Right To Sue Under \xc2\xa71125(a)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Does the cause of action in \xc2\xa71125(a) extend to plaintiffs like Static Control?  The statute authorizes suit by \xe2\x80\x9cany person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged\xe2\x80\x9d by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false advertising.  \xc2\xa71125(a)(1).  Read literally, that broad language might suggest that an action is available to anyone who can satisfy the minimum requirements of Article III.  No party makes that argument, however, and the \xe2\x80\x9cunlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover persuades us that [\xc2\xa71125(a)] should not get such an expansive reading.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holmes, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 266 (footnote omitted).  We reach that conclusion in light of two relevant background principles already mentioned: zone of interests and proximate causality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA. Zone of Interests\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, we presume that a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests \xe2\x80\x9cfall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\xe2\x80\x9d  Allen, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 751.  The modern \xe2\x80\x9czone of interests\xe2\x80\x9d formulation originated in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, \n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 150 (1970)\n, as a limitation on the cause of action for judicial review conferred by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  We have since made clear, however, that it applies to all statutorily created causes of action; that it is a \xe2\x80\x9crequirement of general application\xe2\x80\x9d; and that Congress is presumed to \xe2\x80\x9clegislat[e] against the background of\xe2\x80\x9d the zone-of-interests limitation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich applies unless it is expressly negated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bennett v. Spear, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154, \n163 (1997)\n; see also Holmes, supra, at 287\xe2\x80\x93288 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  It is \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps more accurat[e],\xe2\x80\x9d though not very different as a practical matter, to say that the limitation always applies and is never negated, but that our analysis of certain statutes will show that they protect a more-than-usually \xe2\x80\x9cexpan[sive]\xe2\x80\x9d range of interests.  Bennett, supra, at 164.  The zone-of-interests test is therefore an appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action in \xc2\xa71125(a).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have said, in the APA context, that the test is  not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98especially demanding,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 15).  In that context we have often \xe2\x80\x9cconspicuously included the word \xe2\x80\x98arguably\xe2\x80\x99 in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff,\xe2\x80\x9d and have said that the test \xe2\x80\x9cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Congress authorized that plaintiff to sue.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316).  That lenient approach is an appropriate means of preserving the flexibility of the APA\xe2\x80\x99s omnibus judicial-review provision, which permits suit for violations of numerous statutes of varying character that do not themselves include causes of action for judicial review.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have made clear, however, that the breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue, so that what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative action under the \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cgenerous review provisions\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 of the APA may not do so for other purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bennett, supra, at 163 (quot- ing Clarke, 479 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 400, n.\xc2\xa016, in turn quoting Data Processing, supra, at 156).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIdentifying the interests protected by the Lanham Act, however, requires no guesswork, since the Act includes an \xe2\x80\x9cunusual, and extraordinarily helpful,\xe2\x80\x9d detailed statement of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.

For centuries, it has been \xe2\x80\x9ca well established principle of [the common] law, that in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Waters v. Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 Louisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837); see Holmes, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 287 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  That venerable principle reflects the reality that \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Associ- ated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 536.  Congress, we assume, is familiar with the common-law rule and does not mean to displace it sub silentio.  We have thus construed federal causes of action in a variety of contexts to incorporate a requirement of proximate causation.  See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336, \n346 (2005)\n (securities fraud); Holmes, supra, at 268\xe2\x80\x93270 (RICO); Associated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 529\xe2\x80\x93535 (Clayton Act).  No party disputes that it is proper to read \xc2\xa71125(a) as containing such a requirement, its broad language notwithstanding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe proximate-cause inquiry is not easy to define, and over the years it has taken various forms; but courts have a great deal of experience applying it, and there is a wealth of precedent for them to draw upon in doing so.  See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 830\n\xe2\x80\x93839 (1996); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).  Proximate-cause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory cause of action.  The question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPut differently, the proximate-cause requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo remote\xe2\x80\x9d from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful conduct.  That is ordinarily the case if the harm is purely derivative of \xe2\x80\x9cmisfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holmes, supra, at 268\xe2\x80\x93269; see, e.g., Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, \n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9311 (2010).  In a sense, of course, all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers who are deceived by the advertising; but since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries, the intervening step of consumer deception is not fatal to the showing of proximate causation required by the statute.  See Harold H. Huggins Realty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc., 634 F.\xc2\xa03d 787, 800\xe2\x80\x93801 (CA5 2011).

That showing is generally not made when the deception produces injuries to a fellow commercial actor that in turn affect the plaintiff.  For example, while a competitor who is forced out of business by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s false advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses, the same is not true of the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s landlord, its electric company, and other commercial parties who suffer merely as a result of the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinability to meet [its] financial obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anza, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 458.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC.

But it urges us to adopt, as the optimal formulation of those principles, a multifactor balancing test derived from Associated General Contrac-tors.  In the alternative, it asks that we adopt a categorical test permitting only direct competitors to sue for false advertising.  And although neither party urges adoption of the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interest\xe2\x80\x9d test applied below, several amici do so.  While none of those tests is wholly without merit, we decline to adopt any of them.

The first factor can be read as requiring that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury be within the relevant zone of interests and the second and third as requiring (somewhat redundantly) proximate causation; but it is not correct to treat those requirements, which must be met in every case, as mere factors to be weighed in a balance.  And the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problem- atic.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating principle\xe2\x80\x9d behind the proximate-cause requirement, Anza, supra, at 457\xe2\x80\x93458; but potential diffi- culty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not, as Conte Bros. might suggest, an independent basis for denying standing where it is adequately alleged that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct has proximately injured an interest of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s that the statute protects.  Even when a plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to re- cover damages, it may still be entitled to injunctive re- lief under \xc2\xa71116(a) (assuming it can prove a likelihood of future injury) or disgorgement of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ill-gotten profits under \xc2\xa71117(a).  See TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.\xc2\xa03d 820, 831 (CA9 2011); Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F.\xc2\xa02d 186, 190 (CA2 1980).  Finally, experience has shown that the Conte Bros. approach, like other open-ended balancing tests, can yield unpredictable and at times arbitrary results.  See, e.g., Tushnet, Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal Trademark and False Advertising Law, 159 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1305, 1376\xe2\x80\x931379 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn contrast to the multifactor balancing approach, the direct-competitor test provides a bright-line rule; but it does so at the expense of distorting the statutory language.  To be sure, a plaintiff who does not compete with the defendant will often have a harder time establishing proximate causation.  But a rule categorically prohibiting all suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the Act\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cunfair competition\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71127.  By the time the Lanham Act was adopted, the common-law tort of unfair competition was understood not to be limited to actions between competitors.  One leading authority in the field wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthere need be no competition in unfair competition,\xe2\x80\x9d just as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no soda in soda water, no grapes in grape fruit, no bread in bread fruit, and a clothes horse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things on.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rogers, 39 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J., at 299; accord, Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 300 F. 509, 512 (CA6 1924); 1 H. Nims, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks, p. vi (4th ed. 1947); 2 id., at 1194\xe2\x80\x931205.  It is thus a mistake to infer that because the Lanham Act treats false advertising as a form of unfair competition, it can protect only the false-advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s direct competitors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, there is the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interest\xe2\x80\x9d test applied by the Sixth Circuit in this case.  As typically formulated, it requires a commercial plaintiff to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate \xe2\x80\x98(1)\xc2\xa0a reasonable interest to be protected against the alleged false advertising and (2)\xc2\xa0a reasonable basis for believing that the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged false advertising.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  697 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 410 (quoting Famous Horse, 624 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 113).  A purely practical objection to the test is that it lends itself to widely divergent appli- cation.  Indeed, its vague language can be understood as requiring only the bare minimum of Article III standing.  The popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its appeal to courts tired of \xe2\x80\x9cgrappl[ing] with defining\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable interest\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d test \xe2\x80\x9cwith greater precision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Conte Bros., 165 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 231.  The theoretical difficulties with the test are even more substantial: The relevant question is not whether the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s interest is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d but whether it is one the Lanham Act protects; and not whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable basis\xe2\x80\x9d for the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim of harm, but whether the harm alleged is proximately tied to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  In short, we think the principles set forth above will provide clearer and more accurate guidance than the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interest\xe2\x80\x9d test.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV.

Static Control is suing not as a deceived consumer, but as a \xe2\x80\x9cperso[n] engaged in\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce within the control of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d whose position in the marketplace has been damaged by Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s false advertising.  \xc2\xa71127.  There is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests protected by the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStatic Control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations.  This case, it is true, does not present the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic Lanham Act false-advertising claim\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one competito[r] directly injur[es] another by making false statements about his own goods [or the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s goods] and thus inducing customers to switch.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Harold H. Huggins Realty, 634 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 799, n. 24.  But although diversion of sales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct injury from false advertising, it is not the only type of injury cognizable under \xc2\xa71125(a).  For at least two reasons, Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s allegations satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, Static Control alleged that Lexmark disparaged its business and products by asserting that Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s business was illegal.  See 697 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 411, n.\xc2\xa010 (noting allegation that Lexmark \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly target[ed] Static Control\xe2\x80\x9d when it \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely advertised that Static Control infringed Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s patents\xe2\x80\x9d).  When a defendant harms a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s reputation by casting aspersions on its business, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury flows directly from the audience\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the disparaging statements.  Courts have therefore afforded relief under \xc2\xa71125(a) not only where a defendant denigrates a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s product by name, see, e.g., McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Prods. Corp., 848 F.\xc2\xa02d 34, 38 (CA2 1988), but also where the defendant damages the product\xe2\x80\x99s reputation by, for example, equat-ing it with an inferior product, see, e.g., Camel Hair and Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 799 F.\xc2\xa02d 6, 7\xe2\x80\x938, 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (CA1 1986); PPX Enterprises, Inc. v. Audiofidelity, Inc., 746 F.\xc2\xa02d 120, 122, 125 (CA2 1984).  Traditional proximate-causation principles support those results: As we have observed, a defendant who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to or about the plaintiff or his product\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d may be said to have proximately caused the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s harm.  Bridge, 553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 657 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7870, Comment h (1977); emphasis added in Bridge).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static Control are not direct competitors.  But when a party claims reputational injury from disparagement, competition is not required for proximate cause; and that is true even if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to harm its immediate competitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral damage.  Consider two rival carmakers who purchase airbags for their cars from different third-party manufacturers.  If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from the second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the second carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker and its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and their sales may decline as a result.  In those circumstances, there is no reason to regard either party\xe2\x80\x99s injury as de- rivative of the other\xe2\x80\x99s; each is directly and independently harmed by the attack on its merchandise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, Static Control adequately alleged proximate causation by alleging that it designed, manufactured, and sold microchips that both (1)\xc2\xa0were necessary for, and (2)\xc2\xa0had no other use than, refurbishing Lexmark toner cartridges.  See App. 13, \xc2\xb631; id., at 37, \xc2\xb654.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It follows from that allegation that any false advertising that reduced the remanufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 business necessarily injured Static Control as well.  Taking Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s assertions at face value, there is likely to be something very close to a 1:1 relationship between the number of refurbished Prebate cartridges sold (or not sold) by the remanufacturers and the number of Prebate microchips sold (or not sold) by Static Control.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the injury alleged is so integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, there can be no question\xe2\x80\x9d that proximate cause is satisfied.

Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s allegations therefore might not support standing under a strict application of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral tendency\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not to stretch proximate causation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the first step.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Holmes, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 271.  But the reason for that general tendency is that there ordinarily is a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscontinuity\xe2\x80\x9d between the injury to the direct victim and the injury to the indirect victim, so that the latter is not surely attributable to the former (and thus also to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct), but might instead have resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cany number of [other] reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Anza, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  That is not the case here.  Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s allegations suggest that if the remanufacturers sold 10,000 fewer refurbished cartridges because of Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s false advertising, then it would follow more or less automatically that Static Control sold 10,000 fewer microchips for the same reason, without the need for any \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cintricate, uncertain inquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 459\xe2\x80\x93460.

See, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, \n, and n.\xc2\xa02 (1998); cases citedid., at 114\xe2\x80\x93117 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  That label is an improvement over the language of \xe2\x80\x9cprudential standing,\xe2\x80\x9d since it correctly places the focus on the statute.  But it, too, is misleading, since \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Verizon Md.

Statutory causes of action are regularly interpreted to incorporate standard common-law limitations on civil liability\xe2\x80\x94the zone-of-interests test no less than the requirement of proximate causation, see Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, infra.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Proximate causation is not a requirement of Article III standing, which requires only that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury be fairly traceable to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  \xc2\xa0Like the zone-of-interests test, see supra, at\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939, and nn. 3\xe2\x80\x934, it is an element of the cause of action under the statute, and so is subject to the rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Steel Co., 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89.  But like any other element of a cause of action, it must be adequately alleged at the pleading stage in order for the case to proceed.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n\xe2\x80\x93679 (2009).  If a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to establish proximate causation, then the complaint must be dismissed; if they are sufficient, then the plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to prove them.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We understand this to be the thrust of both sides\xe2\x80\x99 allegations concerning Static Control\xe2\x80\x99s design and sale of specialized microchips for the specific purpose of enabling the remanufacture of Lexmark\xe2\x80\x99s Prebate cartridges.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
