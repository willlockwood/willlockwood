Lawful permanent residents were not regarded as making an \xe2\x80\x9centry,\xe2\x80\x9d upon their return from \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. outside this country\xe2\x80\x99s borders.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, \n\n374 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449\n.  In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures, creating a uniform \xe2\x80\x9cremoval\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229, 1229a.  Congress made \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d the key word, and defined \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(A).  This alteration, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti.  Thus, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as seeking admission if they have \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9ca crime involving moral turpitude .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or conspiracy to commit such a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.  In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents.  In 2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d based on his 1994 conviction.  At Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 removal proceedings, his attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief under former \xc2\xa7212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece.  The BIA affirmed.  In 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability.  He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s new \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  The BIA denied the motion.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  Rejecting Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The impact of Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.

See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n.  The presumption against retroactive legislation \xe2\x80\x9cembodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 265.  Numerous decisions of this Court have invoked Justice Story\xe2\x80\x99s formulation for determining when a law\xe2\x80\x99s retrospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as relevant here, when such application would \xe2\x80\x9cattac[h] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past,\xe2\x80\x9d Society for Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767.  See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289\n; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 939\n; Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 283.  Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability,\xe2\x80\x9d effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, \xe2\x80\x9cin respect to\xe2\x80\x9d past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress did not expressly prescribe \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)\xe2\x80\x99s temporal reach.  The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether application of IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s travel restraint to Vartelas \xe2\x80\x9cwould have retroactive effect\xe2\x80\x9d Congress did not authorize.  See id., at 280.  Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.  Beyond genuine doubt \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v)\xe2\x80\x99s restraint on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Once able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe sanction.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The Government suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States.  But losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases, see Chew Heong v. United States, \n\n112 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536\n; St. Cyr, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321\xe2\x80\x93323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous, see Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 280\xe2\x80\x93286; Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 946\xe2\x80\x93950.

Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for his \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability\xe2\x80\x9d was his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  That past misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted an offense\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).  It reasoned that reliance on the prior law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and that Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration laws.  This reasoning is doubly flawed.  A party is not required to show reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct.  See, e.g., Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 282, n. 35.  In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.  St. Cyr is illustrative.  There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.  Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.  But his removal proceeding was commenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation.  Disallowance of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321.  Aliens like St. Cyr \xe2\x80\x9calmost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 325.  Because applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious and severe retroactive effect,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and Congress made no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyr\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 case is at least as clear as St. Cyr\xe2\x80\x99s for declining to apply a new law retroactively.  St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an official\xe2\x80\x99s permission, to make short trips to see and assist his parents in Greece.  The Second Circuit compounded its initial misperception of the antiretroactivity principle by holding otherwise.  Fleuti continues to govern Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 short-term travel.

He pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four months for that offense.  Vartelas traveled to Greece in 2003 to visit his parents.  On his return to the United States a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible alien and placed in removal proceedings.  Under the law governing at the time of Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 plea, an alien in his situation could travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his resident alien status.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, \n\n374 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449 (1963)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), \n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x93546.  That Act effectively precluded foreign travel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction like Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99.  Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from a sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently removed from the United States.  See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v); \xc2\xa71182(a)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case presents a question of retroactivity not addressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident convicted of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA, which regime governs, the one in force at the time of the conviction, or IIRIRA?  If the former, Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 brief trip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resident status.  If the latter, he may be denied reentry.  We conclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA, \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of reentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 pre-IIRIRA offense, plea, and conviction).  Guided by the deeply rooted presumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 conviction.  The impact of Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 brief travel abroad on his per- manent resident status is therefore determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, United States immigration law established \xe2\x80\x9ctwo types of proceedings in which aliens can be denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation hearings and exclusion hearings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Landon v. Plasencia, \n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21, \n25 (1982)\n.

Originally admitted on a student visa issued in 1979, Vartelas became a lawful permanent resident in 1989.  He currently lives in the New York area and works as a sales manager for a roofing company.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens, New York.  One of his business partners used the shop\xe2\x80\x99s photocopier to make counterfeit travelers\xe2\x80\x99 checks.  Vartelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive any money from the venture.  In 1994, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in violation of \n\n18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7371.  He was sentenced to four months\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration, followed by two years\xe2\x80\x99 supervised release.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tVartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after the passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United States from these visits remained uneventful.  In January 2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking \xe2\x80\x9cadmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  The officer based this classi- fication on Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 1994 conviction.  See United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Volpe v. Smith, \n\n289 U.

See \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996).  This attorney twice failed to appear for hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief.  Vartelas engaged a new attorney, who continued to concede removability and to request discretionary relief.  The Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece.  The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn July 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other lapses, conceding his removability.  He sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s new \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d provision, codified at \xc2\xa71101(a)(13), did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction.  The BIA denied the motion, declaring that Vartelas had not been prejudiced by his lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 performance, for no legal authority prevented the application of IIRIRA to Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 pre-IIRIRA conduct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decision, agreeing that Vartelas had failed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly ineffective performance.  Rejecting Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 argument that IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.  See 620 F. 3d 108, 118\xe2\x80\x93120 (2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn so ruling, the Second Circuit created a split with two other Circuits.  The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held that the new \xc2\xa71101(a)(13) may not be applied to lawful permanent residents who committed crimes listed in \xc2\xa71182 (among them, crimes of moral turpitude) prior to IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F. 3d 383 (CA4 2004); Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F. 3d 872 (CA9 2007).  We granted certiorari, 564 U.

Under IIRIRA, on return from foreign travel, such an alien is treated as a new arrival to our shores, and may be removed from the United States.  Vartelas does not question Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to restrict reentry in this manner.  Nor does he contend that Congress could not do so retroactively.  Instead, he invokes the principle against retro- active legislation, under which courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.

In evaluating Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 argument, we note first a matter not disputed by the Government:  Congress did not expressly prescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in question, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(13).  See Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 280 (Court asks first \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Congress has expressly prescribed [new \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)\xe2\x80\x99s] proper reach\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Respondent 11 (Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in INS v.

Accordingly, we proceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas maintains, application of IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s travel restraint to him \xe2\x80\x9cwould have retroactive effect\xe2\x80\x9d Congress did not authorize.

Neither his sentence, nor the immigration law in effect when he was convicted and sentenced, blocked him from occasional visits to his parents in Greece.  Current \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v), if applied to him, would thus attach \xe2\x80\x9ca new disability\xe2\x80\x9d to conduct over and done well before the provision\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBeyond genuine doubt, we note, the restraint \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) places on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Once able to journey abroad to fulfill religious obligations, attend funerals and weddings of family members, tend to vital financial interests, or respond to family emergencies, permanent residents situated as Vartelas is now face potential banishment.  We have several times recognized the severity of that sanction.  See, e.g., Padilla v.

United States, \n\n112 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536 (1884)\n, a pathmarking decision, the Court confronted the \xe2\x80\x9cChinese Restriction Act,\xe2\x80\x9d which barred Chinese laborers from reentering the United States without a certificate issued on their departure.  The Court held the reentry bar inapplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage and tried to return afterward without a certificate.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, the Court observed, was not \xe2\x80\x9cso clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive application] was the intention of the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 559.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ban on employment discrimination authorizing compensatory and punitive damages applied to pre-enactment conduct.  The Court held it did not.  No doubt the complaint against the employer charged discrimination that violated the Act at the time it occurred.  But compensatory and punitive damages were not then available remedies.  The later provision for such damages, the Court determined, operated prospectively only, and did not apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct oc- curred prior to the amendment.  See 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 280\xe2\x80\x93286.  And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provision removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did not apply to pre-enactment fraud.  As in Landgraf, the provision attached \xe2\x80\x9ca new disability\xe2\x80\x9d to past wrongful conduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively unless Congress clearly manifested such an intention.

At the time of the plea, the alien was eligible for discretionary relief from deportation.  IIRIRA, enacted after entry of the plea, removed that eligibility.  The Court held that the IIRIRA provision in point could not be applied to the alien, for it attached a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability\xe2\x80\x9d to the guilty plea and Congress had not instructed such a result.  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321\xe2\x80\x93323.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government, echoed in part by the dissent, argues that no retroactive effect is involved in this case, for the Legislature has not attached any disability to past conduct.  Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien\xe2\x80\x99s post-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States.  See Brief for Respondent 19\xe2\x80\x9320; post, at 3.  We find this argument disingenuous.  Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 return to the United States occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason for the \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability\xe2\x80\x9d imposed on him was not his lawful foreign travel.  It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA, of an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude.  That past misconduct, in other words, not present travel, is the wrongful activity Congress targeted in \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government observes that lower courts have up- held Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act prosecutions that encompassed pre-enactment conduct.

Campanale, 518 F.\xc2\xa02d 352, 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (CA9 1975) (per curiam)).  But those prosecutions depended on criminal activity, i.e., an act of racketeering occuring after the provision\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in contrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct postdating IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFernandez-Vargas v.

That case involved \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addition, which provides that an alien who reenters the United States after having been removed can be removed again under the same removal order.  We held that the provision could be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Explaining the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, we said: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he conduct of remaining in the country .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is the predicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  It is therefore the alien\xe2\x80\x99s choice to continue his illegal presence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. after the effective date of the new la[w] that subjects him to the new .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. legal regime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 44 (emphasis added).  Vartelas, we have several times stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  He simply took a brief trip to Greece, anticipating a return without incident as in past visits to his parents.  No \xe2\x80\x9cindefinitely continuing\xe2\x80\x9d crime occurred; instead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a pre-IIRIRA crime he was \xe2\x80\x9chelpless to undo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government further refers to lower court decisions in cases involving \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g), which prohibits the possession of firearms by convicted felons.

Ashcroft, 373 F.\xc2\xa03d 480, 491 (2004).  The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 269\xe2\x80\x93270, is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is just what occurred here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing immigration law.  While the presumption against retroactive application of statutes does not require a showing of detrimental reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 389\xe2\x80\x93395, reasonable reliance has been noted among the \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar considerations\xe2\x80\x9d animating the presumption, see Landgraf, 511 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 270 (presumption reflects \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar consid- erations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although not a necessary predicate for in- voking the antiretroactivity principle, the likelihood of reliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.  See Olatunji, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 393 (discussing St. Cyr).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSt. Cyr is illustrative.  That case involved a lawful permanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.  Under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.  But his removal proceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA, withdrew that dispensation.  Disallowance of discretionary waivers, the Court recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cattache[d] a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Aliens like St. Cyr, the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9calmost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 325.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Hence, applying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious and severe retroactive effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

St. Cyr could seek the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary dispensation.  Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, without seeking an official\xe2\x80\x99s permission, to make trips of short duration to see and assist his parents in Greece.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Second Circuit thought otherwise, compounding its initial misperception (treating reliance as essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle).  The deportation provision involved in St. Cyr, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b(a)(3), referred to the alien\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconvict[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime, while the statutory words sub judice in Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99 case were \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted an offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v); see supra, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The practical difference, so far as retroactivity is concerned, escapes from our grasp.  Ordinarily, to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an alien has committed a qualifying crime, the immigration officer at the border would check the alien\xe2\x80\x99s records for a conviction.

This case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Does that statute apply to lawful permanent residents who, like Vartelas, committed one of the specified offenses before 1996, but traveled abroad after 1996?  Under the proper approach to determining a statute\xe2\x80\x99s temporal application, the answer is yes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not contain a clear statement answering the question presented here.  So the Court is correct that this case is governed by our longstanding interpretive principle that, in the absence of a contrary indication, a statute will not be construed to have retroactive application.  See, e.g., Landgraf v. USI Film Products, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n280 (1994)\n.  The operative provision of this text\xe2\x80\x94the provision that specifies the act that it prohibits or prescribes\xe2\x80\x94says that lawful permanent residents convicted of offenses similar to Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99s must seek formal \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d before they return to the United States from abroad.  Since Vartelas returned to the United States after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, the application of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a retroactive effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn determining whether a statute applies retroactively, we should concern ourselves with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s actual operation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.  It is impossible to decide whether a statute\xe2\x80\x99s application is retrospective or prospective without first identifying a reference point\xe2\x80\x94a moment in time to which the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date is either subsequent or antecedent.  (Otherwise, the obvious question\xe2\x80\x94retroactive in reference to what?\xe2\x80\x94remains unanswered.)  In my view, the identity of that reference point turns on the activity a statute is intended to regulate.  For any given regulated party, the reference point (or \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity event\xe2\x80\x9d) is the moment at which the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do what it requires.  See Martin v. Hadix, \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343\n\xe2\x80\x93363 (1999) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Landgraf, supra, at 291 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgments).  With an identified reference point, the retroactivity analysis is simple.  If a person has engaged in the primary regulated activity before the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, then the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application would be retroactive.  But if a person engages in the primary regulated activity after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, then the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application is prospective only.  In the latter case, the interpretive presumption against retroactivity does not bar the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder that commonsense approach, this is a relatively easy case.  Although the class of aliens affected by \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) is defined with respect to past crimes, the regulated activity is reentry into the United States.  By its terms, the statute is all about controlling admission at the border.  It specifies six criteria to identify lawful permanent residents who are subject to formal \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d procedures, most of which relate to the circumstances of departure, the trip itself, or reentry.  The titles of the statutory sections containing \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) confirm its focus on admission, rather than crime: The provision is located within Title III of IIRIRA (\xe2\x80\x9cInspection, Apprehension, Detention, Adjudication, and Removal of Inadmissible and Deportable Aliens\xe2\x80\x9d), under Subtitle A (\xe2\x80\x9cRevision of Procedures for Removal of Aliens\xe2\x80\x9d), and \xc2\xa7301 (\xe2\x80\x9cTreating Persons Present in the United States Without Authorization as Not Admitted\xe2\x80\x9d).  \n\n110Stat.\n3009\xe2\x80\x93575.  And the specific subsection of IIRIRA at issue (\xc2\xa7301(a), entitled \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Admission\xe2\x80\x99 Defined\xe2\x80\x9d) is an amendment to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9centry\xe2\x80\x9d in the general \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitions\xe2\x80\x9d section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  See ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The original provision told border officials how to regulate admission\xe2\x80\x94not how to punish crime\xe2\x80\x94and the amendment does as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) thus has no retroactive effect on Vartelas because the reference point here\xe2\x80\x94Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99s readmission to the United States after a trip abroad\xe2\x80\x94occurred years after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  Although Vartelas cannot change the fact of his prior conviction, he could have avoided entirely the consequences of \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) by simply remaining in the United States or, having left, remaining in Greece.  That \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) had no effect on Vartelas until he performed a post-enactment activity is a clear indication that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application is purely prospective.  See Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, \n\n548 U.\xc2\xa0S. 30\n, n.\xc2\xa011, 46 (2006) (no retroactive effect where the statute in question did \xe2\x80\x9cnot operate on a completed preenactment act\xe2\x80\x9d and instead turned on \xe2\x80\x9ca failure to take timely action that would have avoided application of the new law altogether\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court avoids this conclusion by insisting that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ast misconduct, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not present travel, is the wrongful activity Congress targeted\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).

Instead, the Court simply asserts that Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clawful foreign travel\xe2\x80\x9d surely could not be the \xe2\x80\x9creason for the \xe2\x80\x98new disability\xe2\x80\x99 imposed on him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  But the reason for a prohibition has nothing to do with whether the prohibition is being applied to a past rather than a future act.  It may be relevant to other legal inquiries\xe2\x80\x94for example, to whether a legislative act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article I, see, e.g., Smith v. Doe, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 84, \n92 (2003)\n, or one of the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and \n \nFourteenth Amendments, see, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., \n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483, \n487 (1955)\n, or the Takings Clause in the \n \nFifth Amendment, see, e.g., Kelo v.

But it has no direct bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to differentiate between the statutory-interpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a provision would make it retroactive and hence presumptively unintended) and the validity question (whether giving certain effect to a provision is unlawful) is on full display in its attempts to distinguish \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) from similar statutes.  Take, for example, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  That Act, which targets \xe2\x80\x9cpatterns of racketeering,\xe2\x80\x9d expressly defines those \xe2\x80\x9cpatterns\xe2\x80\x9d to include some pre-enactment conduct.  See \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71961(5).  Courts interpreting RICO therefore need not consider the presumption against retroactivity; instead, the cases cited by the majority consider whether RICO violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See United States v. Brown, 555 F.\xc2\xa02d 407, 416\xe2\x80\x93417 (CA5 1977); United States v. Campanale, 518 F.\xc2\xa02d 352, 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (CA9 1975) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).  The Government recognized this distinction and cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto Clause rather than the presumption against retroactivity, Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9318; the Court evidently does not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s confident assertion that Congress surely would not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas, whose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United States were innocent events, ante, at 11, 14, simply begs the question presented in this case.  Ignorance, of course, is no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his return was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did not render it unlawful.  Since IIRIRA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date in 1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed crimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the United States and return without formally seeking \xe2\x80\x9cadmission.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).  As a result, Vartelas\xe2\x80\x99s numerous trips abroad and \xe2\x80\x9cuneventful\xe2\x80\x9d reentries into the United States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 5, were lawful only if \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to him\xe2\x80\x94which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s circular reasoning betrays its underlying concern: Because the Court believes that reentry after a brief trip abroad should be lawful, it will decline to apply a statute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal aliens.  (The same instinct likely produced the Court\xe2\x80\x99s questionable statutory interpretation in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, \n\n374 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449 (1963)\n.)  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s test for retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94asking whether the statute creates a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9crespect to past events\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94invites this focus on fairness.  Understandably so, since it is derived from a Justice Story opinion interpreting a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that forbade retroactive laws\xe2\x80\x94a provision comparable to the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ex post facto prohibition and bearing no relation to the presumption against retroactivity.  What is unfair or irrational (and hence should be forbidden) has nothing to do with whether applying a statute to a particular act is prospective (and thus presumptively intended) or retroactive (and thus presumptively unintended).  On the latter question, the \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability in respect to past events\xe2\x80\x9d test provides no meaningful guidance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI can imagine countless laws that, like \xc2\xa71101(a)(13) (C)(v), impose \xe2\x80\x9cnew disabilities\xe2\x80\x9d related to \xe2\x80\x9cpast events\xe2\x80\x9d and yet do not operate retroactively.  For example, a statute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.  See, e.g., \n\n20 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71091(r)(1).  Or laws prohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in certain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors.  See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7290.95(c) (West Supp. 2012).  Or laws prohibiting those previously committed for mental instability from purchasing guns.  See, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(4).  The Court concedes that it would not consider the last two laws inapplicable to pre-enactment convictions or commitments.  Ante, at 12, n.\xc2\xa07.  The Court does not deny that these statutes impose a \xe2\x80\x9cnew disability in respect to past events,\xe2\x80\x9d but it distinguishes them based on the reason for their enactment: These statutes \xe2\x80\x9caddress dangers that arise postenactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa07.  So much for the new-disability-in-respect-to-past-events test; it has now become a new-disability-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-danger test.  But why is guarding against future danger the only reason Congress may wish to regulate future action in light of past events?  It obviously is not.  So the Court must invent yet another doctrine to address my first example, the law making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.  According to the Court, that statute differs from \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) because it \xe2\x80\x9chas a prospective thrust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13, n.\xc2\xa07.  I cannot imagine what that means, other than that the statute regulates post-enactment con- duct.  But, of course, so does \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).  Rather than reconciling any of these distinctions with Justice Story\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of retroactivity, the Court leaves to lower courts the unenviable task of identifying new-disabilities-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-danger-and-also-lacking-a-prospective-thrust.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd anyway, is there any doubt that \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) is intended to guard against the \xe2\x80\x9cdangers that arise postenactment\xe2\x80\x9d from having aliens in our midst who have shown themselves to have proclivity for crime?  Must that be rejected as its purpose simply because Congress has not sought to achieve it by all possible means\xe2\x80\x94by ferreting out such dangerous aliens and going through the expensive and lengthy process of deporting them?  At least some of the post-enactment danger can readily be eliminated by forcing lawful permanent residents who have committed certain crimes to undergo formal \xe2\x80\x9cadmission\xe2\x80\x9d procedures at our borders.  Indeed, by limiting criminal aliens\xe2\x80\x99 opportunities to travel and then return to the United States, \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) may encourage self-deportation.  But all this is irrelevant.  The positing of legislative \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d is always a slippery enterprise compared to the simple determination of whether a statute regulates a future event\xe2\x80\x94and it is that, rather than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncement of some forward-looking reason, which governs whether a statute has retroactive effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern about the fairness or rationality of applying \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statutory interpretation question, that concern is greatly exaggerated.  In disregard of a federal statute, convicted criminal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece without ever seeking formal admission at this country\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  When he was finally unlucky enough to be apprehended, and sought discretionary relief from removal under former \xc2\xa7212(c) of the INA, \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found that Vartelas had made frequent trips to Greece and had remained there for long periods of time, that he was \xe2\x80\x9ca serious tax evader,\xe2\x80\x9d that he had offered testimony that was \xe2\x80\x9cclose to incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had not shown hardship to himself or his estranged wife and children should he be removed.  See 620 F.\xc2\xa03d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief for Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In decrying the \xe2\x80\x9charsh penalty\xe2\x80\x9d imposed by this statute on Vartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts.  Ante, at 9.  But never mind.  Under any sensible approach to the presumption against retroactivity, these factual subtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal application of \xc2\xa71101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory interpretation, not broader questions about frustrated expectations or fairness.  Our approach to answering that question should be similarly straightforward: We should determine what relevant activity the statute regulates (here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date should be covered (here, post-1996 reentries).  If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irrational enough to violate the Constitution, that is another matter entirely, and one not presented here.  Our interpretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just that\xe2\x80\x94a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a license to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers more desirable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a statute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on pre-enactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative intent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is post-enactment\xe2\x80\x94that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in question is pre-enactment.
