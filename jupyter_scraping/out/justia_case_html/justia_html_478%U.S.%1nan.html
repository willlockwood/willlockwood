The complaint alleged that Diaz, a nurse, murdered 12 patients by administering massive doses of the heart drug lidocaine.  The preliminary hearing on the complaint commenced on July 6, 1982.  Diaz moved to exclude the public from the proceedings under Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 868 (West 1985), which requires such proceedings to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 478 U. S. 4</a></p><p> open unless "exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect the defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Magistrate granted the unopposed motion, finding that closure was necessary because the case had attracted national publicity and "only one side may get reported in the media."  App. 22a.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing continued for 41 days.  Most of the testimony and the evidence presented by the State was medical and scientific; the remainder consisted of testimony by personnel who worked with Diaz on the shifts when the 12 patients died.  Diaz did not introduce any evidence, but his counsel subjected most of the witnesses to vigorous cross-examination.  Diaz was held to answer on all charges.  At the conclusion of the hearing, petitioner Press-Enterprise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 478 U. S. 5</a></p><p> Company asked that the transcript of the proceedings be released.  The Magistrate refused, and sealed the record.</p>\n<p>On January 21, 1983, the State moved in Superior Court to have the transcript of the preliminary hearing released to the public; petitioner later joined in support of the motion.  Diaz opposed the motion, contending that release of the transcript would result in prejudicial pretrial publicity.  The Superior Court found that the information in the transcript was "as factual as it could be," and that the facts were neither "inflammatory" nor "exciting," but that there was, nonetheless, "a reasonable likelihood that release of all or any part of the transcripts might prejudice defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial."  <em>Id.</em> at 60a, 61a.</p>\n<p>Petitioner then filed a peremptory writ of mandate with the Court of Appeal.  That court originally denied the writ but, after being so ordered by the California Supreme Court, set the matter for a hearing.  Meanwhile, Diaz waived his right to a jury trial and the Superior Court released the transcript.  After holding that the controversy was not moot, the Court of Appeal denied the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court thereafter denied petitioner\'s peremptory writ of mandate, holding that there is no general First Amendment right of access to preliminary hearings.  37 Cal.3d 772, 691 P.2d 1026 (1984).  The court reasoned that the right of access to criminal proceedings recognized in <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html">464 U. S. 501</a></span> (1984) (<em>Press-Enterprise I</em>), and <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html">457 U. S. 596</a></span> (1982), extended only to actual criminal trials.  37 Cal.3d at 776, 691 P.2d at 1028.  Furthermore, the reasons that had been asserted for closing the proceedings in <em>Press-Enterprise I</em> and <em>Globe</em> -- the interests of witnesses and other third parties -- were not the same as the right asserted in this case -- the defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial by a jury uninfluenced by news accounts.</p>\n<p>Having found no general First Amendment right of access, the court then considered the circumstances in which the closure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 478 U. S. 6</a></p><p> would be proper under the California access statute, Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 868 (West 1985).  Under the statute, the court reasoned, if the defendant establishes a "reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice," the burden shifts to the prosecution or the media to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no such reasonable probability of prejudice.  37 Cal.3d at 782, 691 P.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari.  474 U.S. 899 (1985).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We must first consider whether we have jurisdiction under Article III, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution.  In this Court, petitioner challenges the Superior Court\'s original refusal to release the transcript of the preliminary hearing.  As noted above, the specific relief petitioner seeks has already been granted -- the transcript of the preliminary hearing was released after Diaz waived his right to a jury trial.  However, as in <em>Globe Newspaper, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html#603">457 U. S. 603</a></span>, and <em>Gannett Co. v.

S. 368</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/case.html#377">443 U. S. 377</a></span>-378 (1979), this controversy is "<em>capable of repetition, yet evading review.\'"  It can reasonably be assumed that petitioner will be subjected to a similar closure order and, because criminal proceedings are typically of short duration, such an order will likely evade review.  <em>Globe</em> and <em>Gannett,</em> therefore, require the conclusion that this case is not moot.  Accordingly, we turn to the merits.\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is important to identify precisely what the California Supreme Court decided:</p>\n<p>"[W]e conclude that the magistrate shall close the preliminary hearing upon finding a reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice which would impinge upon the right to a fair trial.  Penal code section 868 makes clear that the primary right is the right to a fair trial, and that the public\'s right of access must give way when there is conflict."</p>\n<p>37 Cal.3d at 781, 691 P.2d at 1032. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 478 U. S. 7</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is difficult to disagree in the abstract with that court\'s analysis balancing the defendant\'s right to a fair trial against the public right of access.  It is also important to remember that these interests are not necessarily inconsistent.  Plainly, the defendant has a right to a fair trial but, as we have repeatedly recognized, one of the important means of assuring a fair trial is that the process be open to neutral observers.</p>\n<p>The right to an open public trial is a shared right of the accused and the public, the common concern being the assurance of fairness.  Only recently, in <em>Waller v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/39/case.html">467 U. S. 39</a></span> (1984), for example, we considered whether the defendant\'s Sixth Amendment right to an open trial prevented the closure of a suppression hearing over the defendant\'s objection.  We noted that the First Amendment right of access would in most instances attach to such proceedings, and that</p>\n<p>"the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/39/case.html#46">467 U. S. 46</a></span>.  When the defendant objects to the closure of a suppression hearing, therefore, the hearing must be open unless the party seeking to close the hearing advances an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/39/case.html#47">467 U. S. 47</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Here, unlike <em>Waller,</em> the right asserted is not the defendant\'s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, since the defendant requested a closed preliminary hearing.  Instead, the right asserted here is that of the public under the First Amendment.  <em>See Gannett, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/case.html#397">443 U. S. 397</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring).  The California Supreme Court concluded that the First Amendment was not implicated, because the proceeding was not a criminal trial, but a preliminary hearing.  However, the First Amendment question cannot be resolved solely on the label we give the event, <em>i.e.,</em> "trial" or otherwise, particularly where the preliminary hearing functions much like a full-scale trial. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 478 U. S. 8</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In cases dealing with the claim of a First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings, our decisions have emphasized two complementary considerations.  First, because a "<em>tradition of accessibility implies the favorable judgment of experience,\'" <em>Globe Newspaper,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html#605">457 U. S. 605</a></span> (quoting <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html">448 U. S. 555</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html#589">448 U. S. 589</a></span> (1980) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment)), we have considered whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public.\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Press-Enterprise I,</em> for example, we observed that,</p>\n<p>"since the development of trial by jury, the process of selection of jurors has presumptively been a public process with exceptions only for good cause shown."</p>\n<p>464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#505">464 U. S. 505</a></span>.  In <em>Richmond Newspapers,</em> we reviewed some of the early history of England\'s open trials from the day when a trial was much like a "town meeting."  In the days before the Norman Conquest, criminal cases were brought before "moots," a collection of the freemen in the community.  The public trial, "one of the essential qualities of a court of justice" in England, was recognized early on in the Colonies.  There were risks, of course, inherent in such a "town meeting" trial -- the risk that it might become a gathering moved by emotions or passions growing from the nature of a crime; a "lynch mob" ambience is hardly conducive to calm, reasoned decisionmaking based on evidence.  Plainly, the modern trial with jurors open to interrogation for possible bias is a far cry from the "town meeting trial" of ancient English practice.  Yet even our modern procedural protections have their origin in the ancient common law principle which provided, not for closed proceedings, but rather for rules of conduct for those who attend trials.  <em>Richmond Newspapers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html#567">448 U. S. 567</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Second, in this setting, the Court has traditionally considered whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.  <em>Globe Newspaper, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html#606">457 U. S. 606</a></span>.  Although many governmental processes operate best under public scrutiny, it takes little </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 478 U. S. 9</a></p><p> imagination to recognize that there are some kinds of government operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.  A classic example is that "the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings."  <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/211/case.html">441 U. S. 211</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/211/case.html#218">441 U. S. 218</a></span> (1979).  Other proceedings plainly require public access.  In <em>Press-Enterprise I,</em> we summarized the holdings of prior cases, noting that openness in criminal trials, including the selection of jurors, "enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system."  464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html">464 U. S. 501</a></span>.</p>\n<p>These considerations of experience and logic are, of course, related, for history and experience shape the functioning of governmental processes.  If the particular proceeding in question passes these tests of experience and logic, a qualified First Amendment right of public access attaches.  But even when a right of access attaches, it is not absolute.  <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html#606">457 U. S. 606</a></span>.  While open criminal proceedings give assurances of fairness to both the public and the accused, there are some limited circumstances in which the right of the accused to a fair trial might be undermined by publicity. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In such cases, the trial court must determine whether the situation is such that the rights of the accused override the qualified First Amendment right of access.  In <em>Press-Enterprise I,</em> we stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he presumption may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values, and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 478 U. S. 10</a></p><p> determine whether the closure order was properly entered."</p>\n<p>464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#510">464 U. S. 510</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The considerations that led the Court to apply the First Amendment right of access to criminal trials in <em>Richmond Newspapers</em> and <em>Globe,</em> and the selection of jurors in <em>Press-Enterprise I,</em> lead us to conclude that the right of access applies to preliminary hearings as conducted in California.</p>\n<p>First, there has been a tradition of accessibility to preliminary hearings of the type conducted in California.  Although grand jury proceedings have traditionally been closed to the public and the accused, preliminary hearings conducted before neutral and detached magistrates have been open to the public.  Long ago, in the celebrated trial of Aaron Burr for treason, for example, with Chief Justice Marshall sitting as trial judge, the probable cause hearing was held in the Hall of the House of Delegates in Virginia, the courtroom being too small to accommodate the crush of interested citizens.  <em>United States v. Burr,</em> 25 F.Cas. 1 (No. 14,692) (CC Va. 1807).  From <em>Burr</em> until the present day, the near-uniform practice of state and federal courts has been to conduct preliminary hearings in open court. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  As we noted in <em>Gannett,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 478 U. S. 11</a></p><p> several States following the original New York Field Code of Criminal Procedure published in 1850 have allowed preliminary hearings to be closed on the motion of the accused.  443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/case.html#390">443 U. S. 390</a></span>-391.  But even in these States, the proceedings are presumptively open to the public, and are closed only for cause shown. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Open preliminary hearings, therefore, have been accorded "<em>the favorable judgment of experience.\'"  <em>Globe,</em> 457 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/596/case.html#605">457 U. S. 605</a></span>.\n</em></p>\n<p>The second question is whether public access to preliminary hearings, as they are conducted in California, plays a particularly significant positive role in the actual functioning of the process.  We have already determined in <em>Richmond</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 478 U. S. 12</a></p><p> <em>Newspapers, Globe,</em> and <em>Press-Enterprise I</em> that public access to criminal trials and the selection of jurors is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.  California preliminary hearings are sufficiently like a trial to justify the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>In California, to bring a felon to trial, the prosecutor has a choice of securing a grand jury indictment or a finding of probable cause following a preliminary hearing.  Even when the accused has been indicted by a grand jury, however, he has an absolute right to an elaborate preliminary hearing before a neutral magistrate.  <em>Hawkins v. Superior Court,</em> 22 Cal.3d 584, 586 P.2d 918 (1978).  The accused has the right to personally appear at the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine hostile witnesses, to present exculpatory evidence, and to exclude illegally obtained evidence.  Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 859-866 (West 1985), \xc2\xa7 1538.5 (West Supp.1986).  If the magistrate determines that probable cause exists, the accused is bound over for trial; such a finding leads to a guilty plea in the majority of cases.</p>\n<p>It is true that, unlike a criminal trial, the California preliminary hearing cannot result in the conviction of the accused, and the adjudication is before a magistrate or other judicial officer, without a jury.  But these features, standing alone, do not make public access any less essential to the proper functioning of the proceedings in the overall criminal justice process.  Because of its extensive scope, the preliminary hearing is often the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding.  <em>See Waller v. Georgia,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/39/case.html#46">467 U. S. 46</a></span>-47.  As the California Supreme Court stated in <em>San Jose Mercury-News v. Municipal Court,</em> 30 Cal.3d 498, 511, 638 P.2d 655, 663 (1982), the preliminary hearing in many cases provides "the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system."  <em>See also Richmond Newspapers,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html#572">448 U.

S. 570</a></span>.  Criminal acts, especially certain violent crimes, provoke public concern, outrage, and hostility.</p>\n<p>"When the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions."</p>\n<p><em>Press-Enterprise I,</em> 464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#509">464 U. S. 509</a></span>.  <em>See also</em> H. Weihofen, The Urge to Punish 130-131 (1956); T. Reik, The Compulsion to Confess (1959).  In sum:</p>\n<p>"The value of openness lies in the fact that people not actually attending trials can have confidence that standards of fairness are being observed; the sure knowledge that <em>anyone</em> is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations will become known.  Openness thus enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system."</p>\n<p><em>Press-Enterprise I, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#508">464 U. S. 508</a></span> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude that the qualified First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings applies to preliminary hearings as they are conducted in California.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Since a qualified First Amendment right of access attaches to preliminary hearings in California under Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 858 <em>et seq.</em> (West 1985), the proceedings cannot be closed unless specific, on-the-record findings are made demonstrating that "closure is essential to preserve higher values, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 478 U. S. 14</a></p><p> and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest."  <em>Press-Enterprise I, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#510">464 U.

If the interest asserted is the right of the accused to a fair trial, the preliminary hearing shall be closed only if specific findings are made demonstrating that, first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant\'s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent and, second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant\'s fair trial rights.  <em>See Press-Enterprise I, supra; Richmond Newspapers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html#581">448 U. S. 581</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The California Supreme Court, interpreting its access statute, concluded that "the magistrate shall close the preliminary hearing upon finding a reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice."  37 Cal.3d at 781, 691 P.2d at 1032.  As the court itself acknowledged, the "reasonable likelihood" test places a lesser burden on the defendant than the "substantial probability" test which we hold is called for by the First Amendment.  <em>See ibid.; see also id.</em> at 783, 691 P.2d at 1033 (Lucas, J., concurring and dissenting).  Moreover, that court failed to consider whether alternatives short of complete closure would have protected the interests of the accused.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gannett,</em> we observed:</p>\n<p>"Publicity concerning pretrial suppression hearings such as the one involved in the present case poses special risks of unfairness.  The whole purpose of such hearings is to screen out unreliable or illegally obtained evidence and insure that this evidence does not become known to the jury.  <em>Cf. Jackson v. Denno,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/378/368/case.html">378 U. S. 368</a></span>.  Publicity concerning the proceedings at a pretrial hearing, however, could influence public opinion against a defendant and inform potential jurors of inculpatory information wholly inadmissible at the actual trial."</p>\n<p>443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/case.html#378">443 U. S. 378</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 478 U. S. 15</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But this risk of prejudice does not automatically justify refusing public access to hearings on every motion to suppress.  Through <em>voir dire,</em> cumbersome as it is in some circumstances, a court can identify those jurors whose prior knowledge of the case would disable them from rendering an impartial verdict.  And even if closure were justified for the hearings on a motion to suppress, closure of an entire 41-day proceeding would rarely be warranted.  The First Amendment right of access cannot be overcome by the conclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of that right.  And any limitation must be "narrowly tailored to serve that interest."  <em>Press-Enterprise I, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#510">464 U. S. 510</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The standard applied by the California Supreme Court failed to consider the First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings.  Accordingly, the judgment of the California Supreme Court is reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 868, as amended in 1982, provides in full:</p>\n<p>"The examination shall be open and public.  However, upon the request of the defendant and a finding by the magistrate that exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect the defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial, the magistrate shall exclude from the examination every person except the clerk, court reporter and bailiff, the prosecutor and his or her counsel, the Attorney General, the district attorney of the county, the investigating officer, the officer having custody of a prisoner witness while the witness is testifying, the defendant and his or her counsel, the officer having the defendant in custody and a person chosen by the prosecuting witness who is not himself or herself a witness but who is present to provide the prosecuting witness moral support, provided that the person so chosen shall not discuss prior to or during the preliminary examination the testimony of the prosecuting witness with any person, other than the prosecuting witness, who is a witness in the examination.  Nothing in this section shall affect the right to exclude witnesses as provided in Section 687 of the Penal Code."</p>\n<p>Before 1982, the statute gave the defendant the unqualified right to close the proceedings.  After the California Supreme Court rejected a First Amendment attack on the old statute in <em>San Jose Mercury-News v. Superior Court,</em> 30 Cal.3d 498, 638 P.2d 655 (1982), the California Legislature amended the statute to include the present requirement that the hearing be closed only upon a finding by the magistrate that closure is "necessary in order to protect the defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, the interests of those other than the accused may be implicated.  The protection of victims of sex crimes from the trauma and embarrassment of public scrutiny may justify closing certain aspects of a criminal proceeding.  <em>See Globe Newspaper Co. v.

Although Arizona, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Utah have closure statutes based on the Field Code, <em>see Gannett,</em> 443 U.S. at 391, in each of these States, the Supreme Court has found either a common law or state constitutional right of the public to attend pretrial proceedings.  <em>See Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. Superior Court,</em> 101 Ariz. 257, 418 P.2d 594 (1966); <em>Iowa Freedom of Information Council v. Wifvat, supra; Great Falls Tribune v. District Court, supra; Minot Daily News v.

Lewis, supra.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE REHNQUIST joins as to Part II, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The constitutional question presented by this case is whether members of the public have a First Amendment right to insist upon access to the transcript of a preliminary hearing during the period before the public trial, even though the accused, the prosecutor, and the trial judge have all agreed to the sealing of the transcript in order to assure a fair trial.</p>\n<p>The preliminary hearing transcript to which petitioner sought access consists of 4,239 pages of testimony by prosecution witnesses heard over eight weeks.  The testimony, contained in 47 volumes, accuses Mr. Robert Diaz, a nurse, of murdering 12 patients in the hospital in which he worked by injecting them with lethal doses of a heart drug.  The transcript reveals that the defense put on no witnesses of its own.</p>\n<p>Immediately after the Magistrate ordered the defendant bound over for trial, defense counsel moved that the transcript of the preliminary hearing be sealed to protect his client\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="16">Page 478 U. S. 16</a></p><p> right to a fair trial.  The transcript, in the words of the Magistrate, revealed "only one side of the story."  App. 28a.  The transcript also contained the Magistrate\'s characterization of Mr. Diaz as "the most dangerous type of individual there is."  <em>Id.</em> at 27a.  The prosecutor did not oppose this motion, and the Magistrate, after hearing petitioner\'s objection, ordered the transcript sealed.</p>\n<p>The Superior Court trial judge denied a motion to unseal the transcript.  He found -- and the finding is amply supported by the record -- that</p>\n<p>"there is a reasonable likelihood that making all or any part of the transcripts public might prejudice the defendant\'s right to a fair and impartial trial."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 61a.  <em>Accord, id.</em> at 62a.  The Magistrate had earlier rejected less restrictive alternatives to sealing the transcript, concluding that "the only way to protect" the defendant\'s "[fair trial] right would be to seal the transcript."  <em>Id.</em> at 37a. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge, and denied the peremptory writ of mandate sought by petitioner.  It rejected petitioner\'s assertion that "the superior court failed to state any reasons or make a specific finding to support the sealing order."  App. to Pet. for Cert. E-11.  Instead, it confirmed the trial judge\'s determinations that "the transcript is indicative of only the prosecutorial side of the case," <em>id.</em> at E-14; that the public\'s right of access was overborne by the "reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice" to "the defendant\'s right to a fair trial," <em>id.</em> at E-9; and that "[a]lternatives to sealing the transcript would not suffice in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 478 U. S. 17</a></p><p> case," <em>id.</em> at E-14. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The California Supreme Court similarly denied petitioner\'s request for a peremptory writ of mandate, affirming that a preliminary hearing transcript can be sealed upon a showing of a "reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice which would impinge upon the right to a fair trial."  37 Cal.3d 772, 781, 691 P.2d 1026, 1032 (1984).</p>\n<p>In view of the above, the trial judge had an obvious and legitimate reason for refusing to make the transcript public any sooner than he did.  His decision plainly did not violate the defendant\'s right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment, for it was the defendant who objected to release of the transcript.  <em>See Gannett Co. v. DePasquale,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/368/case.html">443 U.

In my opinion, the judge\'s decision did not violate the First Amendment, either.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although perhaps obvious, it bears emphasis that the First Amendment right asserted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 478 U.

In this case, the risk of prejudice to the defendant\'s right to a fair trial is perfectly obvious.

In those cases, a common law tradition of openness at the time the First Amendment was ratified suggested an intention and expectation on the part of the Framers and ratifiers that those proceedings would remain presumptively open.  Thus, in <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/555/case.html#564">448 U.

Thus, in our prior cases, history mattered primarily for what it revealed about the intentions of the Framers and ratifiers of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>In this case, however, it is uncontroverted that a common law right of access did not inhere in preliminary proceedings at the time the First Amendment was adopted, and that the Framers and ratifiers of that provision could not have intended such proceedings to remain open.  As Justice Stewart wrote for the Court in <em>Gannett Co. v.

Trials at law fairly reported, although they may occasionally prove injurious to individuals, have been held to be privileged.  Let them continue so privileged. . . .

The Court\'s historical crutch cannot carry the weight of opening a preliminary proceeding that the State has ordered closed; that determination must stand or fall on whether it satisfies the second component of the Court\'s test."</p>\n<p>If the Court\'s historical evidence proves too little, the "<em>value of openness,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/case.html#13">478 U. S. 13</a></span> (quoting <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court,</em> 464 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/464/501/case.html#508">464 U. S. 508</a></span>), on which it relies proves too much, for this measure would open to public scrutiny far more than preliminary hearings "as they are conducted in California" (a comforting phrase invoked by the Court in one form or another more than eight times in its opinion). [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  In brief, the Court\'s rationale for opening the "California preliminary hearing" is that it "is often the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding"; that it provides "`the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system;\'" that it lacks the protective presence </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 478 U. S. 26</a></em></p><p><em> of a jury; and that closure denies an outlet for community catharsis.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/case.html#12">478 U. S. 12</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/case.html#13">478 U. S. 13</a></span> (quotation omitted).  The obvious defect in the Court\'s approach is that its reasoning applies to the traditionally secret grand jury with as much force as it applies to California preliminary hearings.  A grand jury indictment is just as likely to be the "final step" in a criminal proceeding and the "sole occasion" for public scrutiny as is a preliminary hearing.  Moreover, many critics of the grand jury maintain that the grand jury protects the accused less well than does a legally knowledgeable judge who personally presides over a preliminary hearing.  <em>See Hawkins v. Superior Court,</em> 22 Cal.2d 584, 590, 586 P.2d 916, 919-920 (1978) (holding deprivation of preliminary hearing to constitute a denial of equal protection under State Constitution in part because "`the grand jury is the total captive of the prosecutor who, if he is candid, will concede that he can indict anybody, at any time, for almost anything, before any grand jury\'" (quoting Campbell, Eliminate the Grand Jury, 64 J.Crim.L. &amp; C. 174 (1973))).  Finally, closure of grand juries denies an outlet for community rage.  When the Court\'s explanatory veneer is stripped away, what emerges is the reality that the California preliminary hearing is functionally identical to the traditional grand jury.  As THE CHIEF JUSTICE emphasized by his quotation of <em>Cox v. Coleridge,</em> 1 B. &amp; C. 37, 49-50, 107 Eng.Rep. 15, 19-20 (1822), in his concurring opinion in <em>Gannett Co. v.

(emphasis added):\n</em></p>\n<p>"\'It [the proceeding] is only a preliminary inquiry, whether there be sufficient ground to commit the prisoner for trial.  The proceeding before the grand jury is <em>precisely of the same nature, and it would be difficult, if the right exists in the present case, to deny it in that.</em>  This being only a preliminary inquiry, and not a trial, makes, in my mind, all the difference.\'"</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reasoning -- if carried to its logical outcome -- thus contravenes the "long-established policy that maintains </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 478 U. S. 27</a></p><p> the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings in the federal courts" and in the courts of 19 States.  <em>United States v.

It is only on the facts of record in this case that the California courts ordered the transcript sealed.  Since many -- if not most -- of the state court decisions collected by the Court hold that the right to a public preliminary hearing is personal to the accused, <em>see, e.g., State v. Porter Superior Court,</em> 274 Ind. 408, 409-410, 412 N.E.2d 748, 750 (1980); <em>Azbill v. Fisher,</em> 84 Nev. 414, 419, 442 P.2d 916, 918-919 (1968), or, more commonly, that it is overcome by a showing of potentially prejudicial publicity equivalent to or less than that required in California, <em>see, e.g., State v. Burak,</em> 37 Conn.Supp. 627, 630, 431 A.2d 1246, 1248 (1981) ("likelihood of prejudice"); <em>United States v. Edwards,</em> 430 A.2d 1321, 1345 (D.C.1981) ("likelihood"), <em>cert. denied,</em> 455 U.S. 1022 (1982); <em>Gannett Pacific Corp. v. Richardson,</em> 59 Haw. 224, 233, 580 P.2d 49, 56 (1978) ("substantial likelihood"); <em>Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Leggett,</em> 48 N.Y.2d 430, 442, 399 N.E.2d 518, 525 (1979) ("strong likelihood"); <em>Kearns-Tribune Corp. v. Lewis,</em> 685 P.2d 515, 523 (Utah 1984) ("<em>realistic likelihood of prejudice\'"); <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Commonwealth,</em> 222 Va. 574, 589, 281 S.E.2d 915, 923 (1981) ("likelihood"); <em>Federated Publications, Inc. v. Kurtz,</em> 94 Wash.2d 51, 62, 615 P.2d 440, 446 (1980) ("likelihood of jeopardy"), courts in these States would presumably have also denied access if presented with the facts of this case.  On this observation, and in view of the fact that the reasoning of the state courts is heavily dependent on this Court\'s cases granting access to criminal proceedings (even if they are ultimately grounded in state law), it is remarkable that the Court finds any historical basis for a public right of access to preliminary proceedings on a showing in excess of that required in California and met by the defendant in this case.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Given the Court\'s focus on the history of preliminary proceedings in general, and its reliance on the broad values served by openness, <em>see ante</em> at 13, I do not see the relevance of the fact that preliminary proceedings in California bear an outward resemblance to criminal trials.  To the extent that it matters that, in California,</p>\n<p>"[t]he accused has the right to personally appear at the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine hostile witnesses, to present exculpatory evidence, and to exclude illegally obtained evidence,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at 12 (citing Cal.Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 859-866 (West 1985), \xc2\xa7 1538.5 (West 1982)), it bears mention that many other States have reformed their grand juries to include one or more of these procedural reforms, <em>see</em> W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa7 15.2(b) (1984).  After today\'s decision, one can only wonder whether the public enjoys a right of access to any or all of these proceedings as well.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Five reasons are commonly given for the policy of grand jury secrecy:</p>\n<p>"\'(1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; (5) to protect the innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Douglas Oil Co. v.
