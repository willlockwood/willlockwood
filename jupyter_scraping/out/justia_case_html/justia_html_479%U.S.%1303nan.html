I see, moreover, at least a " fair prospect" that a majority of this Court would find that conclusion erroneous. See Rostker v. Goldberg, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1306/case.html#1308">448 U.S. 1306, 1308</a>, 2 (1980) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers). However, approximately one month after this case was decided the Kentucky Legislature enacted a statute providing specific procedures for securing the testimony of young victims of sexual abuse. See Ky.Rev.Stat. 421.350 (Supp.1986). The Supreme Court of Kentucky has upheld the validity of that statute, even though it does not require presence of the accused at the competency hearing. See Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224 (Ky.1986). Since, therefore, it is unlikely that the issue presented by this case will arise again in Kentucky, and since I am unaware of any other State which has resolved the issue as did the Kentucky Supreme Court, see, e.g., State v. Taylor, 103 N.M. 189, 195, 704 P.2d 443, 449 (App.1985); Moll v.
