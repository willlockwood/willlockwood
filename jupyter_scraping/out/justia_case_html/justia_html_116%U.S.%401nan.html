S. 402</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This motion is denied.  According to the petition, the court entertained jurisdiction of the cause, but dismissed it for want of due prosecution -- that is to say because errors had not been assigned in accordance with the rules of practice applicable to the form of the action.  This is a judgment which can only be reviewed by writ of error or appeal, as the case may be.  Mandamus lies to compel a court to take jurisdiction in a proper case, but not to control its discretion while acting within its jurisdiction.  This rule is elementary.  <em>Ex Parte Morgan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/174/case.html">114 U.
