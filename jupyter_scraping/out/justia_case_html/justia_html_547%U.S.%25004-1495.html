In the end, the Postal Service begrudgingly embraced the multiline technology, but awarded the lucrative equipment contract to a competing firm.  Subsequently, Postal Service inspectors investigated REI and its chief executive, respondent Moore, for their alleged involvement in a consulting-firm kickback scandal and for their alleged improper role in the search for a new Postmaster General.  Urged at least in part by the inspectors to bring criminal charges, a federal prosecutor tried REI and its top officials.  But, finding a complete lack of evidence connecting them to any wrongdoing, the District Court acquitted the defendants.  Moore then filed an action under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, against the federal prosecutor and petitioner postal inspectors, arguing, as relevant here, that they had engineered the prosecution in retaliation for his lobbying efforts.  The claims against the prosecutor were dismissed in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment.  Ultimately, the entire suit was dismissed, but the Court of Appeals reinstated the retaliatory-prosecution claim against the inspectors.  Back in District Court, the inspectors moved for summary judgment, claiming that because the underlying criminal charges were supported by probable cause they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution action must plead and show the absence of probable cause for pressing the underlying criminal charges.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0As a general matter, this Court has held that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions, including criminal prosecutions, for speaking out.  <em>Crawford-El</em> v. <em>Britton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/574/index.html">523 U. S. 574</a>, 592.  When nonretaliatory grounds are insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, retaliation is subject to recovery as the but-for cause of official injurious action offending the Constitution, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 593, and a vengeful federal officer is subject to damages under <em>Bivens.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although a <em>Bivens</em> (or 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983) plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retaliatory animus and subsequent injury in any retaliation action, the need to demonstrate causation in the retaliatory-prosecution context presents an additional difficulty which can be overcome by a showing of the absence of probable cause.  In an ordinary retaliation case, the evidence of motive and injury are sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other, and the causation is understood to be but-for causation, without which the adverse action would not have been taken.  When the claimed retaliation is, however, a criminal charge, the action will differ in two ways.  First, evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the criminal charge will be highly valuable circumstantial evidence to prove or disprove retaliatory causation.  Demonstrating a lack of probable cause will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that the prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.  Second, since the defendant in a retaliatory-prosecution case will not be the prosecutor, who has immunity, but an official who allegedly influenced the prosecutorial decision, the causal connection required is not between the retaliatory animus of one person and that person\xe2\x80\x99s own injurious action, as it is in the ordinary retaliation case, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the adverse action of another.  Because evidence of an inspector\xe2\x80\x99s animus does not necessarily show that the inspector induced the prosecutor to act when he would not have pressed charges otherwise and because of the longstanding presumption of regularity accorded prosecutorial decisionmaking, a showing of the absence of probable cause is needed to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent\xe2\x80\x99s retaliatory motive and the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s injurious action and to rebut the presumption.

Though not necessarily dispositive, the absence of probable cause along with a retaliatory motive on the part of the official urging prosecution are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption of regularity behind the charging decision and enough for a prima facie inference that the unconstitutionally motivated inducement infected the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to go forward.

The question is whether the complaint states an actionable violation of the First Amendment without alleging an absence of probable cause to support the underlying criminal charge.  We hold that want of probable cause must be alleged and proven.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, respondent William G. Moore, Jr., was the chief executive of Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), which manufactured a multiline optical character reader for interpreting multiple lines of text.  Although REI had received some $50 million from the United\xc2\xa0States Postal Service to develop this technology for reading and sorting mail, the Postmaster General and other top officials of the Postal Service were urging mailers to use nine-digit zip codes (Zip + 4), which would provide enough routing information on one line of text to allow single-line scanning machines to sort mail automatically by reading just that line.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Besides Moore, who obviously stood to gain financially from the adoption of multiline technology, some Members of Congress and Government research officers had reservations about the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s Zip + 4 policy and its intended reliance on single-line readers.  Critics maligned single-line scanning technology, objected to the foreign sources of single-line scanners, decried the burden of remembering the four extra numbers,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and echoed the conclusion reached by the United States Office of Technology Assessment, that use of the single-line scanners in preference to multiliners would cost the Postal Service $1 million a day in operational losses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore built on this opposition to Zip + 4, by lobbying Members of Congress, testifying before congressional committees, and supporting a \xe2\x80\x9cBuy American\xe2\x80\x9d rider to the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s 1985 appropriations bill.  Notwithstanding alleged requests by the Postmaster General to be quiet, REI followed its agenda by hiring a public-relations firm, Gnau and Associates, Inc. (GAI), which one of the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s governors, Peter Voss, had recommended.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The campaign succeeded, and in July 1985 the Postal Service made what it called a \xe2\x80\x9cmid-course correction\xe2\x80\x9d and embraced multiline technology.  Brief for Respondent 4.  But the change of heart did not extend to Moore and REI, for the Service\xe2\x80\x99s ensuing order of multiline equipment, valued somewhere between $250 million and $400 million went to a competing firm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only did REI lose out on the contract, but Moore and REI were soon entangled in two investigations by Postal Service inspectors.  The first looked into the purported payment of kickbacks by GAI to Governor Voss for Voss\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations of GAI\xe2\x80\x99s services, as in the case of REI; the second sought to document REI\xe2\x80\x99s possibly improper role in the search for a new Postmaster General.  Notwithstanding very limited evidence linking Moore and REI to any wrongdoing, an Assistant United States Attorney decided to bring criminal charges against them, and in 1988 the grand jury indicted Moore, REI, and REI\xe2\x80\x99s vice president.  At the close of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case, after six weeks of trial, however, the District Court concluded that there was a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete lack of direct evidence\xe2\x80\x9d connecting the defendants to any of the criminal wrongdoing alleged, and it granted the REI defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion for judgment of acquittal.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Recognition Equip. Inc.</em>, 725 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 587, 596 (DC 1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moore then brought an action in the Northern District of Texas for civil liability under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] against the prosecutor and the five postal inspectors who are petitioners here (a sixth having died).  His complaint raised five causes of action, only one of which is relevant here, the claim that the prosecutor and the inspectors had engineered his criminal prosecution in retaliation for criticism of the Postal Service, thus violating the First Amendment.  In the course of these proceedings Moore has argued, among other things, that the postal inspectors launched a criminal investigation against him well before they had any inkling of either of the two schemes mentioned above, that the inspectors targeted him for his lobbying activities, and that they pressured the United\xc2\xa0States Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office to have him indicted.  Moore also sought recovery from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  The District Court dismissed the claims against the Assistant United States Attorney in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment, and rejected an abuse-of-process claim against the inspectors.  <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Valder</em>, Civil Action No. 3:91\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x932491\xe2\x80\x93G (ND Tex., Sept. 21, 1992).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The claims remaining were transferred to the District Court for the District of Columbia, where Moore\xe2\x80\x99s suit was dismissed in its entirety, Civ. Nos. 92\xe2\x80\x932288 (NHJ), 93\xe2\x80\x930324 (NHJ), 1993 WL 405785 (Sept. 24, 1993), only to have the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstate the retaliatory-prosecution claim.  <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Valder</em>, 65 F.\xc2\xa03d 189 (1995).  The District Court then permitted limited discovery on that matter so far as the inspectors were involved, but again dismissed the remaining charges against the United States and the prosecutor.  <em>Moore</em> v. <em>Valder, </em>Civil Action No. 92\xe2\x80\x932288 (NHJ) et\xc2\xa0al., Record, Tab No. 32 (Memorandum Opinion, Feb. 5, 1998).  Although Moore succeeded in having the District of Columbia Circuit reinstate his FTCA claim against the United States, the dismissal of his claims against the prosecutor was affirmed.  <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 213 F.\xc2\xa03d 705 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the remainder of the case back in District Court, the inspectors moved for summary judgment, urging that because the underlying criminal charges were supported by probable cause they were entitled to qualified immunity from a retaliatory-prosecution suit.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  388 F.\xc2\xa03d 871 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have divided on the issue of requiring evidence of a lack of probable cause in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and <em>Bivens </em>retaliatory-prosecution suits.  Some Circuits burden plaintiffs with the obligation to show its absence.  See, <em>e.g., Wood </em>v. <em>Kesler</em>, 323 F.\xc2\xa03d 872, 883 (CA11 2003); <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>Tejeda</em>, 290 F.\xc2\xa03d 252, 260 (CA5 2002); <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Borden</em>, 959 F.\xc2\xa02d 1174, 1179\xe2\x80\x931180 (CA2 1992).  Others, including the District of Columbia Circuit, impose no such requirement.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Poole </em>v. <em>County of Otero</em>, 271 F.\xc2\xa03d 955, 961 (CA10 2001); <em>Haynesworth </em>v. <em>Miller</em>, 820 F.\xc2\xa02d 1245, 1256\xe2\x80\x931257 (CADC 1987).  We granted certiorari, 545 U.

Some official actions adverse to such a speaker might well be unexceptionable if taken on other grounds, but when nonretaliatory grounds are in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, we have held that<font b="1"> retaliation is subject to recovery as the but-for cause of official action offending the Constitution.

Without such a requirement, they first say, the <em>Bivens</em> claim is too readily available.  A plaintiff can afflict a public officer with disruption and expense by alleging nothing more, in practical terms, than action with a retaliatory animus, a subjective condition too easy to claim and too hard to defend against.  Brief for Petitioners 21\xe2\x80\x9323; see also <em>National Archives and Records Admin.</em> v. <em>Favish,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/157/index.html">541 U. S. 157</a>, 175 (2004) (allegations of government misconduct are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98easy to allege and hard to disprove\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the inspectors\xe2\x80\x99 view, some \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d burden must be imposed on these plaintiffs, simply to filter out the frivolous.  The second argument complements the first, for the inspectors believe that the traditional tort of malicious prosecution tells us what the objective requirement should be.  Brief for Petitioners 24\xe2\x80\x9329.  In an action for malicious prosecution after an acquittal, a plaintiff must show that the criminal action was begun without probable cause for charging the crime in the first place; the inspectors see retaliatory prosecution under <em>Bivens </em>as a close cousin of malicious prosecution under common law, making the latter\xe2\x80\x99s no-probable-cause requirement a natural feature of the constitutional tort.<em> </em>See <em>Heck</em> v. <em>Humphrey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/477/index.html">512 U. S. 477</a>, 483\xe2\x80\x93485, and 484, n.\xc2\xa04 (1994).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, we think there is a fair argument for what the inspectors call an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d fact requirement in this type of case, but the nub of that argument differs from the two they set out, which we will deal with only briefly.  As for the invitation to rely on common-law parallels, we certainly are ready to look at the elements of common-law torts when we think about elements of actions for constitutional violations, see <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Piphus,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/247/index.html">435 U. S. 247</a>, 258 (1978), but the common law is best understood here more as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components of <em>Bivens</em> torts.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Albright</em> v. <em>Oliver,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/266/index.html">510 U. S. 266</a>, 277, n. 1 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., concurring); <em>Bivens,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 394; cf. <em>Baker</em> v. <em>McCollan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/137/index.html">443 U. S. 137</a>, 146 (1979).  And in this instance we could debate whether the closer common-law analog to retaliatory prosecution is malicious prosecution (with its no-probable-cause element) or abuse of process (without it).  Compare <em>Heck</em>, 512 U. S., at 483\xe2\x80\x93485, and 484, n.\xc2\xa04 with <em>id.,</em> at 493\xe2\x80\x93496 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there much leverage in the fear that without a filter to screen out claims federal prosecutors and federal courts will be unduly put upon by the volume of litigation.  The basic concern is fair enough, but the slate is not blank.  Over the past 25 years fewer than two dozen damages actions for retaliatory prosecution under <em>Bivens </em>or \xc2\xa71983 have come squarely before the Federal Courts of Appeals, and there is no disproportion of those cases in Circuits that do not require showing an absence of probable cause.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is, instead, the need to prove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with details specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, that provides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause requirement espoused by the inspectors.  Although a <em>Bivens</em> (or \xc2\xa71983) plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retaliatory animus and subsequent injury in any sort of retaliation action, see<em> Crawford-El</em>, 523 U. S., at 593; <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>429 U. S., at 285\xe2\x80\x93287, the need to demonstrate causation in the retaliatory-prosecution context presents an additional difficulty that can be understood by comparing the requisite causation in ordinary retaliation claims, where the government agent allegedly harboring the animus is also the individual allegedly taking the adverse action, with causation in a case like this one.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Take the example of a public employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he was fired for speech criticizing the government.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, 566\xe2\x80\x93567 (1968) (allegation that a school board dismissed a teacher for writing a public letter critical of the board\xe2\x80\x99s financial administration).  While the employee plaintiff obviously must plead and prove adverse official action in retaliation for making the statements, our discussions of the elements of the constitutional tort do not specify any necessary details about proof of a connection between the retaliatory animus and the discharge, which will depend on the circumstances.  Cf. <em>Crawford-El</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 593 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]t least with certain types of claims, proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation\xe2\x80\x94there must also be evidence of causation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The cases have simply taken the evidence of the motive and the discharge as sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mt. Healthy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 287; see also <em>Arlington Heights</em> v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/index.html">429 U. S. 252</a>, 270, n. 21 (1977).  It is clear, moreover, that the causation is understood to be but-for causation, without which the adverse action would not have been taken; we say that upon a prima facie<em> </em>showing of retaliatory harm, the burden shifts to the defendant official to demonstrate that even without the impetus to retaliate he would have taken the action complained of (such as firing the employee).  See <em>Mt. Healthy</em>, 429 U. S., at 287.  If there is a finding that retaliation was not the but-for cause of the discharge, the claim fails for lack of causal connection between unconstitutional motive and resulting harm, despite proof of some retaliatory animus in the official\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  See <em>ibid</em>.  It may be dishonorable to act with an unconstitutional motive and perhaps in some instances be unlawful, but action colored by some degree of bad motive does not amount to a constitutional tort if that action would have been taken anyway.  See <em>Crawford-El</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 593; <em>Mt. Healthy,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 285\xe2\x80\x93286.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the claimed retaliation for protected conduct is a criminal charge, however, a constitutional tort action will differ from this standard case in two ways.  Like any other plaintiff charging official retaliatory action, the plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution claim must prove the elements of retaliatory animus as the cause of injury, and the defendant will have the same opportunity to respond to a prima facie case by showing that the action would have been taken anyway, independently of any retaliatory animus.  What is different about a prosecution case, however, is that there will always be a distinct body of highly valuable circumstantial evidence available and apt to prove or disprove retaliatory causation, namely evidence showing whether there was or was not probable cause to bring the criminal charge.  Demonstrating that there was no probable cause for the underlying criminal charge will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.  This alone does not mean, of course, that a <em>Bivens </em>or \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff should be required to plead and prove no probable cause, but it does mean that litigating probable cause will be highly likely in any retaliatory-prosecution case, owing to its powerful evidentiary significance.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second respect in which a retaliatory-prosecution case is different also goes to the causation that a <em>Bivens</em> plaintiff must prove; the difference is that the requisite causation between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retaliatory animus and the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury is usually more complex than it is in other retaliation cases, and the need to show this more complex connection supports a requirement that no probable cause be alleged and proven.  A <em>Bivens</em> (or \xc2\xa71983) action for retaliatory prosecution will not be brought against the prosecutor, who is absolutely immune from liability for the decision to prosecute, <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/index.html">424 U. S. 409</a>, 431 (1976).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Instead, the defendant will be a non-prosecutor, an official, like an inspector here, who may have influenced the prosecutorial decision but did not himself make it, and the cause of action will not be strictly for retaliatory prosecution, but for successful retaliatory inducement to prosecute.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The consequence is that a plaintiff like Moore must show that the nonprosecuting official acted in retaliation, and must also show that he induced the prosecutor to bring charges that would not have been initiated without his urging.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the causal connection required here is not merely between the retaliatory animus of one person and that person\xe2\x80\x99s own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the action of another.  See 213 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 710 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to find that a defendant procured a prosecution, the plaintiff must establish \xe2\x80\x98a chain of causation\xe2\x80\x99 linking the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions with the initiation of criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Barts </em>v. <em>Joyner</em>, 865 F.\xc2\xa02d 1187, 1195 (CA11 1989) (plaintiff seeking damages incident to her criminal prosecution would have to show that the police, who allegedly acted in violation of law in securing her arrest, unduly pressured or deceived prosecutors); <em>Dellums </em>v. <em>Powell</em>, 566 F.\xc2\xa02d 167, 192\xe2\x80\x93193 (CADC 1977) (where allegation of misconduct is directed at police, a malicious-prosecution claim cannot stand if the decision made by the prosecutor to bring criminal charges was independent of any pressure exerted by police); cf. <em>Smiddy </em>v. <em>Varney</em>, 665 F.\xc2\xa02d 261, 267 (CA9 1981) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here police officers do not act maliciously or with reckless disregard for the rights of an arrested person, they are not liable for damages suffered by the arrested person after a district attorney files charges unless the presumption of independent judgment by the district attorney is rebutted\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Herein lies the distinct problem of causation in cases like this one.  Evidence of an inspector\xe2\x80\x99s animus does not necessarily show that the inspector induced the action of a prosecutor who would not have pressed charges otherwise.  Moreover, to the factual difficulty of divining the influence of an investigator or other law enforcement officer upon the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s mind, there is an added legal obstacle in the longstanding presumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial decisionmaking.  See <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/525/471/index.html">525 U. S. 471</a>, 489\xe2\x80\x93490 (1999); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Armstrong,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/456/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/456/index.html">517 U. S. 456</a>, 464\xe2\x80\x93466 (1996).  And this presumption that a prosecutor has legitimate grounds for the action he takes is one we do not lightly discard, given our position that judicial intrusion into executive discretion of such high order should be minimal, see <em>Wayte</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/598/index.html">470 U. S. 598</a>, 607\xe2\x80\x93608 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some sort of allegation, then, is needed both to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent\xe2\x80\x99s motive and the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s action, and to address the presumption of prosecutorial regularity.  And at the trial stage, some evidence must link the allegedly retaliatory official to a prosecutor whose action has injured the plaintiff.  The connection, to be alleged and shown, is the absence of probable cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be open to us, of course, to give no special prominence to an absence of probable cause in bridging the causal gap, and to address this distinct causation concern at a merely general level, leaving it to such pleading and proof as the circumstances allow.  A prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of retaliatory thinking on his part, for example, would be of great significance in addressing the presumption and closing the gap.  So would evidence that a prosecutor was nothing but a rubber stamp for his investigative staff or the police.  Cf. <em>Mt. Healthy</em>, 429 U. S., at 281\xe2\x80\x93283. (evidence that the board of education, which formally decided not to rehire a teacher, was only nominally distinct from the school superintendent, who allegedly bore the retaliatory animus).  In fact, though, these examples are likely to be rare and consequently poor guides in structuring a cause of action.  In most cases, for instance, it would be unrealistic to expect a prosecutor to reveal his mind even to the degree that this record discloses, with its reported statement by the prosecutor that he was not galvanized by the merits of the case, but sought the indictment against Moore because he wanted to attract the interest of a law firm looking for a tough trial lawyer.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the significance of probable cause or the lack of it looms large, being a potential feature of every case, with obvious evidentiary value.  True, it is not necessarily dispositive: showing an absence of probable cause may not be conclusive that the inducement succeeded, and showing its presence does not guarantee that inducement was not the but-for fact in a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But a retaliatory motive on the part of an official urging prosecution combined with an absence of probable cause supporting the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to go forward are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption of regularity behind the charging decision, see <em>Bordenkircher</em> v. <em>Hayes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/357/index.html">434 U. S. 357</a>, 364 (1978) (emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the prosecutor has probable cause,\xe2\x80\x9d the charging decision is generally discretionary), and enough for a prima facie<em> </em>inference that the unconstitutionally motivated inducement infected the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to bring the charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our sense is that the very significance of probable cause means that a requirement to plead and prove its absence will usually be cost free by any incremental reckoning.  The issue is so likely to be raised by some party at some point that treating it as important enough to be an element will be a way to address the issue of causation without adding to time or expense.  See n.\xc2\xa07, <em>supra</em>.  In this case, for example, Moore cannot succeed in the retaliation claim without showing that the Assistant United States Attorney was worse than just an unabashed careerist, and if he can show that the prosecutor had no probable cause, the claim of retaliation will have some vitality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the complexity of causation in a claim that prosecution was induced by an official bent on retaliation should be addressed specifically in defining the elements of the tort.  Probable cause or its absence will be at least an evidentiary issue in practically all such cases.  Because showing an absence of probable cause will have high probative force, and can be made mandatory with little or no added cost, it makes sense to require such a showing as an element of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case, and we hold that it must be pleaded and proven.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice and Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.,</em> Seaberry, Durenberger Begins Campaign Against Nine-Digit Zip Code, Washington Post, Feb. 24, 1981, p.

It is true that the disagreement over a no-probable-cause requirement arose on the inspectors\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment on their qualified-immunity defense; Moore stresses that an interlocutory appeal can be taken from the rejection of qualified immunity at the summary-judgment stage only on questions turning on the definition of the violation, not on the sufficiency of the evidence to show that a defendant is in fact entitled to the immunity claimed.  See <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 528 (1985).  Moore says that the issue of probable cause or its absence is simply an evidentiary matter going to entitlement in fact.  But the inspectors are making more than a claim about the evidence in this case: they are arguing that we should hold that a showing of no probable cause is an element of the kind of claim Moore is making against them.  In agreeing with the inspectors, we are addressing a requirement of causation, which Moore must plead and prove in order to win, and our holding does not go beyond a definition of an element of the tort, directly implicated by the defense of qualified immunity and properly before us on interlocutory appeal.

Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Armstrong</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/456/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/456/index.html">517 U.
