Where employees have engaged in an economic strike, the employer may hire permanent replacements whom it need not discharge even if the strikers offer to return to work unconditionally.  If the work stoppage is an unfair labor practice strike, the employer must discharge any replacements in order to accommodate returning strikers.  In this case, we must decide whether the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act) preempts a misrepresentation and breach of contract action against the employer brought in state court by strike replacements who were displaced by reinstated strikers after having been offered and accepted jobs on a permanent basis and assured they would not be fired to accommodate returning strikers.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner Belknap, Inc., is a corporation engaged in the sale of hardware products and certain building materials.  A bargaining unit consisting of all of Belknap\'s warehouse and maintenance employees selected International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local No. 89 (Union) as their collective bargaining representative.  In 1975, the Union and Belknap entered into an agreement which was to expire on January 31, 1978.  The two opened negotiations for a new contract </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 463 U. S. 494</a></p><p> shortly before the expiration of the 1975 agreement, but reached an impasse.  On February 1, 1978, approximately 400 Belknap employees represented by the Union went out on strike.  Belknap then granted a wage increase, effective February 1, for union employees who stayed on the job.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the strike began, Belknap placed an advertisement in a local newspaper seeking applicants to "permanently replace striking warehouse and maintenance employees." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A large number of people responded to the offer and were hired.  After each replacement was hired, Belknap presented to the replacement the following statement for his signature:</p>\n<p>"I, the undersigned, acknowledge and agree that I as of this date have been employed by Belknap, Inc. at its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 463 U. S. 495</a></p><p> Louisville, Kentucky, facility as a regular full time permanent replacement to permanently replace _____ in the job classification of  __________."</p>\n<p>On March 7, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges against petitioner Belknap.  The charge was based on the unilateral wage increase granted by Belknap.  Belknap countered with charges of its own.  On April 4, the company distributed a letter which said, in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"TO ALL PERMANENT REPLACEMENT EMPLOYEES"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"We recognize that many of you continue to be concerned about your status as an employee.  The Company\'s position on this matter has not changed, nor do we expect it to change.  You will continue to be permanent replacement employees so long as you conduct yourselves in accordance with the policies and practices that are in effect here at Belknap."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"We continue to meet and negotiate in good faith with the Union.  It is our hope and desire that a mutually acceptable agreement can be reached in the near future.  However, we have made it clear to the Union that we have no intention of getting rid of the permanent replacement employees just in order to provide jobs for the replaced strikers if and when the Union calls off the strike."</p>\n<p>On April 27, the Regional Director issued a complaint against Belknap, asserting that the unilateral increase violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(5) of the Act. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Also on April 27, the company again addressed the strike replacements: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 463 U. S. 496</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"We want to make it perfectly clear, once again, that there will be no change in your employment status as a result of the charge by the National Labor Relations Board, which has been reported in this week\'s newspapers."</p>\n<p>"We do not believe there is any substance to the charge, and we feel confident we can prove in the courts satisfaction that our intent and actions are completely within the law."</p>\n<p>A hearing on the unfair labor practice charges was scheduled for July 19.  The Regional Director convened a settlement conference shortly before the hearing was to take place.  He explained that, if a strike settlement could be reached, he would agree to the withdrawal and dismissal of the unfair labor practice charges and complaints against both the company and the Union.  During these discussions, the parties made various concessions, leaving one major issue unresolved, the recall of the striking workers.  The parties finally agreed that the company would, at a minimum, reinstate 35 strikers per week.  The settlement agreement was then reduced to writing.  Petitioner laid off the replacements, including the 12 respondents, in order to make room for the returning strikers.</p>\n<p>Respondents sued Belknap in the Jefferson County, Ky., Circuit Court for misrepresentation and breach of contract.  Belknap, they alleged, had proclaimed that it was hiring permanent employees, knowing both that the assertion was false </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 463 U. S. 497</a></p><p> and that respondents would detrimentally rely on it.  The alternative claim was that Belknap was liable for breaching its contracts with respondents by firing them as a result of its agreement with the Union.  Each respondent asked for $250,000 in compensatory damages, and an equal amount in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Belknap, after unsuccessfully seeking to remove the suit to federal court, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] moved for summary judgment, on the ground that respondents\' causes of action were preempted by the NLRA.  The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed.  The court first concluded that preemption was inappropriate because Belknap\'s alleged activities were not unfair labor practices.  Belknap\'s action was not prohibited by 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(a)(3), which makes unlawful discrimination in personnel decisions for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging membership in a particular union, since plaintiffs did not seek membership in any labor organization. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Relying on <em>Linn v. Plant Guard Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/case.html">383 U. S. 53</a></span> (1966), the court also concluded that the suit was not preempted, because the contract and misrepresentation claims were of only peripheral concern to the NLRA and were deeply rooted in local law.  The Kentucky Supreme Court granted discretionary review, but later vacated its order as having been improvidently entered.</p>\n<p>We granted Belknap\'s petition for certiorari, 457 U.S. 1131 (1982).  We affirm. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 463 U.

We address first the <em>Machinists</em> and then the <em>Garmon</em> submissions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is asserted that Congress intended the respective conduct of the Union and Belknap during the strike beginning on February 1 "<em>to be controlled by the free play of economic forces,\'" <em>Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#140">427 U. S. 140</a></span>, quoting <em>NLRB v.

S. 144</a></span> (1971), and that entertaining the action against Belknap was an impermissible attempt by the Kentucky courts to regulate and burden one of the employer\'s primary weapons during an economic strike, that is, the right to hire permanent replacements.  To permit the suit filed in this case to proceed would upset the delicate balance of forces established by the federal law.  Subjecting the employer to costly suits for damages under state law for entering into settlements calling for the return of strikers would also conflict with the federal labor policy favoring the settlement of labor disputes.  These arguments, it is urged, are valid whether or not a strike is an economic strike. </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 463 U. S. 500</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded.  It is true that the federal law permits, but does not require, the employer to hire replacements during a strike, replacements that it need not discharge in order to reinstate strikers if it hires the replacements on a "permanent" basis within the meaning of the federal labor law.  But when an employer attempts to exercise this very privilege by promising the replacements that they will not be discharged to make room for returning strikers, it surely does not follow that the employer\'s otherwise valid promises of permanent employment are nullified by federal law, and its otherwise actionable misrepresentations may not be pursued.  <em>See J. I. Case Co. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/332/case.html">321 U. S. 332</a></span> (1944); <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#505">463 U. S. 505</a></span>-506,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#511">463 U. S. 511</a></span>-512, n. 13.  We find unacceptable the notion that the federal law on the one hand insists on promises of permanent employment if the employer anticipates keeping the replacements in preference to returning strikers, but on the other hand forecloses damages suits for the employer\'s breach of these very promises.  Even more mystifying is the suggestion that the federal law shields the employer from damages suits for misrepresentations that are made during the process of securing permanent replacements and are actionable under state law.</p>\n<p>Arguments that entertaining suits by innocent third parties for breach of contract or for misrepresentation will "burden" the employer\'s right to hire permanent replacements are no more than arguments that "this is war," that "anything goes," and that promises of permanent employment that under federal law the employer is free to keep, if it so chooses, are essentially meaningless.  It is one thing to hold that the federal law intended to leave the employer and the union free to use their economic weapons against one another, but is quite another to hold that either the employer or the union is also free to injure innocent third parties without regard to the normal rules of law governing those relationships.  We cannot agree with the dissent that Congress intended such a lawless regime. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 463 U. S. 501</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The argument that entertaining suits like this will interfere with the asserted policy of the federal law favoring settlement of labor disputes fares no better.  This is just another way of asserting that the employer need not answer for its repeated assurances of permanent employment or for its otherwise actionable misrepresentations to secure permanent replacements.  We do not think that the normal contractual rights and other usual legal interests of the replacements can be so easily disposed of by broad-brush assertions that no legal rights may accrue to them during a strike because the federal law has privileged the "permanent" hiring of replacements and encourages settlement.</p>\n<p>In defense of this position, Belknap, supported by the Board in an <em>amicus</em> brief, urges that permitting the state suit where employers may, after the beginning of a strike, either be ordered to reinstate strikers or find it advisable to sign agreements providing for reinstatement of strikers, will deter employers from making permanent offers of employment, or at the very least force them to condition their offer by stating the circumstances under which replacements mus be fired.  This would considerably weaken the employer\'s position during the strike, it is said, because, without assuring permanent employment, it would be difficult to secure sufficient replacements to keep the business operating.  Indeed, as the Board interprets the law, the employer must reinstate strikers at the conclusion of even a purely economic strike unless it has hired "permanent" replacements, that is, hired in a manner that would</p>\n<p>"show that the men [and women] who replaced the strikers were regarded by themselves and the [employer] as having received their jobs on a permanent basis."</p>\n<p><em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,</em> 165 N.L.R.B. 514, 516 (1967), <em>aff\'d sub nom.

If serious detriment will result to the employer from conditioning offers so as to avoid a breach of contract if the employer is forced by Board order to reinstate strikers or if the employer settles on terms requiring such reinstatement, much the same result would follow from Belknap\'s and the Board\'s construction of the Act.  Their view is that, as a matter of federal law, an employer may terminate replacements, without liability to them, in the event of settlement or Board decision that the strike is an unfair labor practice strike.  Any offer of permanent employment to replacements is thus necessarily conditional and nonpermanent.  This view of the law would inevitably become widely known, and would deter honest employers from making promises that they know they are not legally obligated to keep.  Also, many putative replacements would know that the proffered job is, in important respects, nonpermanent, and may not accept employment for that reason.  It is doubtful, with respect to the employer\'s ability to hire, that there would be a substantial difference between the effect of the Board\'s preferred rule and a rule that would subject the employer to damages liability unless it suitably conditions its offers of employment made to replacements. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Belknap counters that conditioning offers in such manner will render replacements nonpermanent employees subject to discharge to make way for strikers at the conclusion or settlement of a purely economic strike, which would not be the case if replacements had been hired on a "permanent" basis as the Board now understands that term.  The balance of power would thus be distorted if the employer is forced to condition its offers for its own protection.  Under Belknap\'s submission, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 463 U. S. 503</a></p><p> however, which is to some extent supported by the Board, Belknap\'s promises, although in form assuring permanent employment, would as a matter of law be nonpermanent to the same extent as they would be if expressly conditioned on the eventuality of settlement requiring reinstatement of strikers and on its obligation to reinstate unfair labor practice strikers.  As we have said, we cannot believe that Congress determined that the employer must be free to deceive by promising permanent employment knowing that it may choose to reinstate strikers or may be forced to do so by the Board.</p>\n<p>An employment contract with a replacement promising permanent employment, subject only to settlement with its employees\' union and to a Board unfair labor practice order directing reinstatement of strikers, would not in itself render the replacement a temporary employee subject to displacement by a striker over the employer\'s objection during or at the end of what is proved to be a purely economic strike.  The Board suggests that such a conditional offer "might" render the replacements only temporary hires that the employer would be required to discharge at the conclusion of a purely economic strike.  Brief for NLRB as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> (NLRB Br.) 17.  But the permanent-hiring requirement is designed to protect the strikers, who retain their employee status and are entitled to reinstatement unless they have been permanently replaced.  That protection is unnecessary if the employer is ordered to reinstate them because of the commission of unfair labor practices.  It is also meaningless if the employer settles with the union and agrees to reinstate strikers.  But the protection is of great moment if the employer is not found guilty of unfair practices, does not settle with the union, or settles without a promise to reinstate.  In that eventuality, the employer, although it has prevailed in the strike, may refuse reinstatement only if it has hired replacements on a permanent basis.  If it has promised to keep the replacements on in such a situation, discharging them to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 463 U. S. 504</a></p><p> make way for selected strikers whom it deems more experienced or more efficient would breach its contract with the replacements.  Those contracts, it seems to us, create a sufficiently permanent arrangement to permit the prevailing employer to abide by its promises. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 463 U. S. 505</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We perceive no substantial impact on the availability of settlement of economic or unfair labor practice strikes if the employer is careful to protect itself against suits like this in the course of contracting with strike replacements. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Its risk </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 463 U. S. 506</a></p><p> of liability if it discharges replacements pursuant to a settlement or to a Board order would then be minimal.  We fail to understand why, in such circumstances, the employer would be any less willing to settle the strike than it would be under the regime proposed by Belknap and the Board, which, as a matter of law, would permit it to settle without liability for misrepresentation or for breach of contract.</p>\n<p>Belknap and its supporters, the Board and the AFL-CIO, offer no substantial case authority for the proposition that the <em>Machinists</em> rationale forecloses this suit.  Surely <em>Machinists</em> did not deal with solemn promises of permanent employment, made to innocent replacements, that the employer was free to make and keep under federal law.  <em>J. I. Case Co. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/332/case.html">321 U. S. 332</a></span> (1944), suggests that individual contracts of employment must give way to otherwise valid provisions of the collective bargaining contract, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/332/case.html#336">321 U.

S. 340</a></span>.  There, the cease-and-desist order, as modified, stated that the discontinuance of the individual contracts was</p>\n<p>"without prejudice to the assertion of any legal rights the employee may have acquired under such contract or to any defenses thereto by the employer."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/342/case.html">321 U.

S. 507</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is still another variant or refinement of the argument that the employer and the Union should be privileged to settle their dispute and provide for striker reinstatement free of burdensome lawsuits such as this.  It is said that respondent replacements are employees within the bargaining unit, that the Union is the bargaining representative of petitioner\'s employees, and the replacements are thus bound by the terms of the settlement negotiated between the employer and "their" representative. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The argument is not only that, as a matter of federal law, the employer cannot be foreclosed from discharging the replacements pursuant to a contract with a bargaining agent, but also that, by virtue of the agreement with the Union, it is relieved from responding in damages for its knowing breach of contract -- that is, that the contracts are not only not specifically enforceable, but also may be breached free from liability for damages.  We need not address the former issue -- the issue of specific performance -- since the respondents ask only damages.  As to the damages issue, as we have said above, such an argument was rejected in <em>J. I. Case.</em></p>\n<p>If federal law forecloses this suit, more specific and persuasive reasons than those based on <em>Machinists</em> must be identified to support any such result.  Belknap insists that the rationale of the <em>Garmon</em> decision, properly construed and applied, furnishes these reasons.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The complaint issued by the Regional Director alleged that, on or about February 1, Belknap unilaterally put into effect a 50c-per-hour wage increase, that such action constituted unfair </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 463 U. S. 508</a></p><p> labor practices under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(5), and that the strike was prolonged by these violations.  If these allegations could have been sustained, the strike would have been an unfair labor practice strike almost from the very start.  From that time forward, Belknap\'s advertised offers of permanent employment to replacements would arguably have been unfair labor practices, since they could be viewed as threats to refuse to reinstate unfair labor practice strikers.  <em>See NLRB v. Laredo Coca Cola Bottling Co.,</em> 613 F.2d 1338, 1341 (CA5), <em>cert. denied,</em> 449 U.S. 889 (1980). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Furthermore, if the strike had been an unfair labor practice strike, Belknap would have been forced to reinstate the strikers, rather than keep replacements on the job.  <em>Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html">350 U. S. 270</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/270/case.html#278">350 U. S. 278</a></span> (1956).  Belknap submits that its offers of permanent employment to respondents were therefore arguably unfair labor practices, the adjudication of which were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board, and that discharging respondents to make way for strikers was protected activity, since it was no more than the federal law required in the event the unfair labor practices were proved. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 463 U. S. 509</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondents do not dispute that it was the Board\'s exclusive business to determine, one, whether Belknap\'s unilateral wage increase was an unfair labor practice, which would have converted the strike into an unfair labor practice strike that required the reinstatement of strikers, and, two, whether Belknap also committed unfair labor practices by offering permanent employment to respondents.  They submit, however, that, under our cases, properly read, their actions for fraud and breach of contract, are not preempted.  We agree with respondents.</p>\n<p>Under <em>Garmon,</em> a State may regulate conduct that is of only peripheral concern to the Act or that is so deeply rooted in local law that the courts should not assume that Congress intended to preempt the application of state law.  In <em>Linn v. Plant Guard Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/case.html">383 U. S. 53</a></span> (1966), we held that false and malicious statements in the course of a labor dispute were actionable under state law if injurious to reputation, even though such statements were in themselves unfair labor practices adjudicable by the Board.  Likewise, in <em>Farmer v. Carpenter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/290/case.html">430 U. S. 290</a></span> (1977), we held that the Act did not preempt a state action for intentionally inflicting emotional distress, even though a major part of the cause of action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 463 U. S. 510</a></p><p> consisted of conduct that was arguably an unfair labor practice.  Finally, in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Carpenters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/180/case.html">436 U. S. 180</a></span> (1978), we held that a state trespass action was permissible and not preempted, since the action concerned only the location of the picketing, while the arguable unfair labor practice would focus on the object of the picketing.  In that case, we emphasized that a critical inquiry in applying the <em>Garmon</em> rules, where the conduct at issue in the state litigation is said to be arguably prohibited by the Act, and hence within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB, is whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical with that which could be presented to the Board.  There the state court and Board controversies could not fairly be called identical.  This is also the case here.</p>\n<p>Belknap contends that the misrepresentation suit is preempted because it related to the offers and contracts for permanent employment, conduct that was part and parcel of an arguable unfair labor practice.  It is true that whether the strike was an unfair labor practice strike and whether the offer to replacements was the kind of offer forbidden during such a dispute were matters for the Board.  The focus of these determinations, however, would be on whether the rights of strikers were being infringed.  Neither controversy would have anything in common with the question whether Belknap made misrepresentations to replacements that were actionable under state law.  The Board would be concerned with the impact on strikers, not with whether the employer deceived replacements.  As in <em>Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, supra,</em> "the Board [will] not be ignored since its sanctions alone can adjust the equilibrium disturbed by an unfair labor practice."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/case.html#66">383 U. S. 66</a></span>.  The strikers cannot secure reinstatement, or indeed any relief, by suing for misrepresentation in state court.  The state courts in no way offer them an alternative forum for obtaining relief that the Board can provide.  The same was true in <em>Sears</em> and <em>Farmer.</em>  Hence, it appears to us that maintaining the misrepresentation action would not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 463 U. S. 511</a></p><p> interfere with the Board\'s determination of matters within its jurisdiction, and that such an action is of no more than peripheral concern to the Board and the federal law.  At the same time, Kentucky surely has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations that have caused them grievous harm.  It is no less true here than it was in <em>Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/case.html#63">383 U. S. 63</a></span>, that "[t]he injury" remedied by the state law "has no relevance to the Board\'s function," and that "[t]he Board can award no damages, impose no penalty, or give any other relief" to the plaintiffs in this case.  The state interests involved in this case clearly outweigh any possible interference with the Board\'s function that may result from permitting the action for misrepresentation to proceed.</p>\n<p>Neither can we accept the assertion that the breach of contract claim is preempted.  The claimed breach is the discharge of respondents to make way for strikers, an action allegedly contrary to promises that were binding under state law.  As we have said, respondents do not deny that, had the strike been adjudicated an unfair labor practice strike, Belknap would have been required to reinstate the strikers, an obligation that the State could not negate. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But respondents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 463 U. S. 512</a></p><p> do assert that such an adjudication has not been made, that Belknap prevented such an adjudication by settling with the Union and voluntarily agreeing to reinstate strikers, and that, in any event, the reinstatement of strikers, even if ordered by the Board, would only prevent the specific performance of Belknap\'s promises to respondents, not immunize Belknap from responding in damages for its breach of its otherwise enforceable contracts.</p>\n<p>For the most part, we agree with respondents.  We have already concluded that the federal law does not expressly or impliedly privilege an employer, as part of a settlement with a union, to discharge replacements in breach of its promises of permanent employment.  Also, even had there been no settlement and the Board had ordered reinstatement of what it held to be unfair labor practice strikers, the suit for damages for breach of contract could still be maintained without in any way prejudicing the jurisdiction of the Board or the interest of the federal law in insuring the replacement of strikers.  The interests of the Board and the NLRA, on the one hand, and the interest of the State in providing a remedy to its citizens for breach of contract, on the other, are "discrete" concerns, <em>cf. Farmer v. Carpenters,</em> 430 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/290/case.html#304">430 U. S. 304</a></span>.  We see no basis for holding that permitting the contract cause of action will conflict with the rights of either the strikers or the employer or would frustrate any policy of the federal labor laws.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because neither the misrepresentation nor the breach of contract cause of action is preempted under <em>Garmon</em> or <em>Machinists,</em> the decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 463 U.

But if the employer did so, surely the employees affected could seek protection in the state courts.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The refusal to fire permanent replacements because of commitments made to them in the course of an economic strike satisfies the requirement of <em>NLRB v.

That the offer and promise of permanent employment are conditional does not render the hiring any less permanent if the conditions do not come to pass.  All hirings are to some extent conditional.  As the Board recognizes, NLRB Br., at 16-17, although respondents were hired on a permanent basis, they were subject to discharge in the event of a business slowdown.  Had Belknap not settled and no unfair practices been filed, surely it would have been free to retain respondents and obligated to do so by the terms of its promises to them.  The result should be the same if Belknap had promised to retain them if it did not settle with the union and if it were not ordered to reinstate strikers.</p>\n<p>The dissent and the concurrence make much of conditional offers of employment, asserting that they prevent replacements from being permanent employees.  As indicated in the text, however, the Board\'s position is that even unconditional contracts of permanent employment are, as a matter of law, defeasible, first, if the strike turns out to be an unfair labor practice strike, and second if the employer chooses to settle with the union and reinstate the strikers.  If these implied conditions, including those dependent on the volitional act of settlement, do not prevent the replacements from being permanent employees, neither should express conditions which do no more than inform replacements what their legal status is in any event.</p>\n<p>The dissent and the concurrence suggest that, if offers of permanent employment are not necessary to secure the manpower to keep the business operating, returning strikers must be given preference over replacements who have been hired on a permanent basis.  That issue is not posed in this case, but we note that the Board has held to the contrary.  In <em>Hot Shoppes, Inc.,</em> 146 N.L.R.B. 802, 805 (1964), the Board held as follows:</p>\n<p>"We, however, disagree with the Trial Examiner\'s premise that an employer may replace economic strikers only if it is shown that he acted to preserve efficient operation of his business.  The Supreme Court\'s decision in <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Company,</em> and the cases thereafter, although referring to an employer\'s right to continue his business during a strike, state that an employer has a legal right to replace economic strikers at will.  We construe these cases as holding that the motive for such replacements is immaterial, absent evidence of an independent unlawful purpose.  Therefore, we reject the Trial Examiner\'s conclusion that the plan to replace the economic strikers here was itself improper and that the strike was converted to an unfair labor practice strike on January 4 by Respondent\'s implementation of such plan."</p>\n<p>The Board noted its holding in <em>Hot Shoppes, Inc.,</em> in its Twenty-Ninth Annual Report of the National Labor Relations Board 29 (1964), and the holding has not been repudiated by the Board.  <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp.,</em> 172 N.L.R.B. 514, n. 3, 535 (1968).  There are no cases in this Court that require a different conclusion.  Indeed, as indicated above, in <em>Hot Shoppes, Inc., supra,</em> the Board read <em>NLRB v.

Corp.,</em> 212 N.L.R.B. 214 (1974), <em>enf\'d,</em> 514 F.2d 995 (CA6 1975), is not to the contrary.  There the replacements could be fired at the will of the employer for any reason; the employer would violate no promise made to a replacement if it discharged some of them to make way for returning strikers, even if the employer was not required to do so by the terms of a settlement with the union.  Of course, in the end, JUSTICE BLACKMUN does not defer to, but rejects, the position of the Board that respondents\' suit is preempted by the NLRA.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>If, as we hold, an employer may condition its offer to replacements and hence avoid conflicting obligations to strikers and replacements in the event of a settlement providing for reinstatement, the employer will very likely do so.  Hence, there will be little occasion for replacements to bring suits for breach of contract or misrepresentation.  The employer that nevertheless makes unconditional commitments to replacements and wants to discharge them after settlement with the union will be in much the same position as the employer in <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Rubber Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/757/case.html">461 U. S. 757</a></span> (1983).  There the employer signed a conciliation agreement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that conflicted with its collective bargaining agreement with the union.  We recognized the employer\'s dilemma, but because it was of the employer\'s own making, we unanimously refused to relieve the employer of either obligation.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/757/case.html#770">461 U.

It suggests that replacements are bound only by those agreements that a union makes, as the exclusive bargaining agent for the struck employer\'s workers, regarding the terms and conditions of employment for the employer\'s workforce after the termination of the strike.

It is not easy to grasp why the employer who settles a purely economic strike (such as one in which no unfair labor practice charge is filed) and hires permanent replacements to make way for returning strikers could be made to respond in damages; yet the employer who violates the labor laws is for that reason insulated from damages liability when it discharges replacements to whom it has promised permanent employment.  The dissent asserts that to subject the unfair labor practice employer to damages suits would cause intolerable confusion, but, as we see it, there would be no interference with the Board\'s authority to impose its remedy for violating the federal labor law.  Performing that function neither requires nor suggests that the replacements must be deprived of their remedy for breach of contract.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#500">463 U. S. 500</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Of course, here there was no adjudication of an unfair practice.  The employer settled short of that possible outcome.  That action was <em>not</em> required by federal law.  We do not share the dissent\'s apparent view that federal labor policy favoring settlement privileges the employer to make and break contracts with innocent third parties at will.  Nor do we understand why the threat of liability to discharged replacements, in the event the employer loses the unfair labor practice case and discharges them, would deter the employer from settling with the Board where it thinks the unfair labor practice charge will be sustained.  Settling would not increase its potential liability to replacements.  It may be that the employer would prefer to settle even a case that it is quite confident it could win, but that is surely no reason to deprive the replacements of their contract.  Nor in such a case do the equities favor the strikers over the replacements, who would be entitled to stay unless the employer has violated the federal law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Kentucky may not mandate specific performance of the contract between Belknap and respondents, nor may it enter an injunction requiring the reinstatement of respondents as a remedy for fraud if either action necessitates the firing of a striker entitled to reinstatement.  To do so would be to deprive returning strikers of jobs committed to them by the national labor laws.  As the Court said in <em>National Licorice Co. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/350/case.html">309 U. S. 350</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/350/case.html#365">309 U.

The Court today, it seems to me, ignores this fundamental premise of federal labor law in order to conform the substance of the NLRA to the contract and tort laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Having done so, the Court not surprisingly concludes that those state laws are not preempted by the refashioned NLRA.  I cannot participate in this extraordinary approach to labor law preemption.</p>\n<p>The Court recognizes that,</p>\n<p>"as the Board interprets the law, the employer must reinstate strikers at the conclusion of even a purely economic strike unless it has hired \'permanent\' replacements, that is, hired in a manner that would"</p>\n<p>"show that the men [and women] who replaced the strikers were regarded by themselves and the [employer] as having received their jobs on a permanent basis."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#501">463 U.

The Court holds today, however, that the employer may refuse to reinstate strikers at the end of an economic strike if the employer has promised its strike replacements "permanent employment, <em>subject only to settlement with its employees\' union</em> and to a Board unfair labor practice order," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#503">463 U. S. 503</a></span> (emphasis supplied) -- in other words, if the employer has promised that the jobs are permanent unless it later decides they are temporary.  Such a promise bears little resemblance to a promise of permanent employment.  During settlement negotiations, the union can be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 463 U. S. 514</a></p><p> counted on to demand reinstatement for returning strikers as a condition for any settlement; the employer can be counted on to acquiesce, at a price the union certainly will be willing to pay. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In rejecting the Board\'s longstanding view of the Act, the Court does not pause to determine whether the Board\'s view is reasonable, or whether it is contrary to the statutory mandate or frustrates Congress\' policy objectives.  <em>See FEC v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/27/case.html">454 U.

S. 291</a></span> (1965).  Rather, it adopts an approach that itself is at wide variance with the NLRA.  Under the Act, an employer may eliminate economic strikers\' jobs only by showing "<em>legitimate and substantial business justifications.\'"  <em>NLRB v. Fleetwood Trailer Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/375/case.html">389 U.

As the Court recognizes, this rule flows from the Act\'s fundamental premise that economic strikers "retain their employee status and are entitled to reinstatement."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#503">463 U.

The employer may refuse reinstatement if it has promised permanent employment to replacements.  But this is true only because such promises are deemed necessary to serve the employer\'s legitimate and substantial business justification in seeking "to protect and continue his business by supplying places left vacant" by the strikers.  <em>NLRB v. Mackay Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/333/case.html">304 U.

The Board reasonably has concluded that this purpose is served only by a promise that the job is not subject to cancellation at the employer\'s option.  <em>Covington Furniture Mfg. Corp.,</em> 212 N.L.R.B. 214, 220 (1974), <em>enf\'d,</em> 514 F.2d 995 (CA6 1975). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  It is patently unreasonable to suppose that the promise the Court substitutes -- that the replacements are permanent unless the employer decides otherwise -- would further the employer\'s legitimate goal at all.  It is in order to allay the potential replacements\' fear that the employer will replace them as part of a settlement with the </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 463 U. S. 516</a></em></p><p><em> union that the employer must make the promise in the first place.\n</em></p>\n<p>Indeed, an employer who makes a conditional promise has no legitimate, much less substantial, business justification to refuse to agree with the union to reinstate the strikers.  Under the Court\'s scenario, the employer has managed to operate its business by hiring replacements on the understanding that they may be fired as part of a settlement of the strike.  And whether or not state contract and tort remedies are preempted by the Act, the employer can agree to reinstate the strikers at the replacements\' expense without incurring liability.  The Court\'s convoluted attempt to establish that its conditional promise would serve some legitimate business purpose, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#503">463 U. S. 503</a></span>-504, and n. 8, fails to come to grips with these simple facts.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s conditional promise achieves only one thing:   it permits an employer, during settlement negotiations with the union, to threaten to retain replacement employees in preference to returning strikers despite the fact that the employer has not promised to do so.  The naked interest in making such a threat, silently endorsed in the Court\'s opinion, could not be less legitimate under the NLRA.  From the employer\'s point of view, one benefit of offering strike replacements permanent employment is that strikers become fearful that they will lose their jobs.  But it is clear that creating this fear, which discourages union membership and concerted activities, is a deleterious side effect of, rather than a legitimate business justification for, the power to hire permanent strike replacements.  <em>See NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp.,</em> 373 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/221/case.html#232">373 U. S. 232</a></span>.  Promises of permanent employment, and subsequent retention of replacements, are permitted only because it is believed that the harm to protected activities is outweighed by the employer\'s interest in operating its plant during a strike.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, an employer who succeeds in operating the plant without promising permanent employment would have no legitimate basis for not reinstating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 463 U. S. 517</a></p><p> economic strikers.  In my view, having made only the Court\'s conditional promise, an employer who threatened during strike negotiations to retain strike replacements in preference to economic strikers would commit an unfair labor practice.  <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 158(a)(1) and (3); <em>cf. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/575/case.html">395 U. S. 575</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/575/case.html#618">395 U. S. 618</a></span>-620 (1969) (employer may predict adverse consequences of concerted activities flowing from "economic necessities" they engender, but may not make a "threat of reprisal" for engaging in concerted activities); <em>NLRB v. Fleetwood Trailer Co.,</em> 389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/375/case.html#378">389 U. S. 378</a></span> (unjustified refusal to reinstate strikers at end of economic strike is unfair labor practice because it discourages exercise of right to strike).</p>\n<p>The Board\'s construction of the Act is reasonable, and entitled to a deference that is wholly lacking in the Court\'s opinion.  By brushing aside the Board\'s interpretation of the Act, and substituting its own novel construction, the Court sidesteps the real question in what is, as the dissent observes, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#523">463 U. S. 523</a></span>, "a difficult case."  The question presented is whether respondents\' state contract and tort actions are preempted by the Act, not whether the Act can be manipulated into a posture consistent with such lawsuits.  Taking federal law as it is, however, while the question is close, I conclude that neither of respondents\' causes of action is preempted. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>I cannot easily dismiss the basic premises underlying either the Court\'s opinion or the dissenting opinion.  On the one hand, the dissent aptly observes that respondents\' state </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 463 U. S. 518</a></p><p> law claims "go to the core of federal labor policy."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#524">463 U. S. 524</a></span>.  One would not expect that Congress would have left anything so basic as the respective rights and duties of strike replacements and employers to the nonuniform regulation of the States.  <em>Cf. New York Tel. Co. v. New York State Labor Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/case.html">440 U. S. 519</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/case.html#549">440 U. S. 549</a></span> (1979) (concurring opinion).  On the other hand, there is great strength in the bedrock of the Court\'s position -- it is difficult to believe that Congress could have intended to permit employers and unions "to injure innocent third parties without regard to the normal rules of law governing those relationships."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#500">463 U. S. 500</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Any attempt to reconcile these concerns, in my view, must begin with an analysis of the nature of the economic weapon at issue.  The heart of the weapon is the power to hire replacements.  The promise of permanent employment is simply one means of achieving this end, a means that unquestionably is permitted by the NLRA.  The dissent appears to view the self-help weapon as the power to make such promises, and concludes that Congress intended that this power would be largely unregulated.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#536">463 U. S. 536</a></span>-538.  The Court appears to take a different view of the nature of the weapon, implying that the weapon properly is seen as the power to contract with replacement employees, not merely to promise permanent jobs, and that the normal state law accompaniments of contracts were contemplated and accepted by Congress.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#500">463 U. S. 500</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#512">463 U. S. 512</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I believe that the Court\'s view is more consistent with the purposes and qualities of this particular economic weapon.  One may agree with the dissent that permitting employers to hire replacement workers "is part of the balance struck by the Act between labor and management," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#536">463 U. S. 536</a></span>, without conceding that all means of accomplishing this were meant to be unregulated.  As noted above, the very purpose of enabling an employer to offer permanent employment to strike replacements is to permit the employer to keep its business running during a strike.  If the promises of permanent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 463 U. S. 519</a></p><p> employment are unenforceable,</p>\n<p>"many putative replacements would know that the proffered job is, in important respects, nonpermanent, and [might] not accept employment for that reason."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#502">463 U. S. 502</a></span>.  The dissent\'s view that federal law intends those offers to be nonbinding would undermine the reason for permitting them.  If the promises are enforceable under state law, however, they are credible; this is the only result consistent with the promises\' federal purpose.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is difficult to explain the employer\'s power to prefer permanent strike replacements over returning economic strikers unless, through the promise of permanent employment, the employer has incurred an obligation to those replacements.  The employer makes offers of permanent employment to induce replacement workers to take jobs.  But what is the legitimate and substantial business justification for later refusing to reinstate returning strikers if, as a matter of federal law, the employer is entitled to discharge the replacements in derogation of its promises to them?  This power to override the economic strikers\' statutory entitlement to reinstatement must be based on the common sense notion that, in order to continue to operate the business, the employer was required to obligate itself to third parties in a manner inconsistent with the strikers\' right to subsequent reinstatement.  Certainly, avoidance of liability for breach of contract is a legitimate business objective.  Because federal law apparently does not obligate the employer to fulfill its promises to the replacements, it must be the typical state law obligation to honor one\'s commitments that justifies the employer\'s disregard for the returning strikers\' otherwise paramount statutory entitlement.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Because this case does not fit comfortably within labor preemption doctrine as heretofore developed by this Court, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#523">463 U. S. 523</a></span>-524,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#530">463 U. S. 530</a></span>, and n. 2 (dissenting opinion), and because I share the Court\'s doubt that Congress could have intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 463 U. S. 520</a></p><p> to deprive strike replacements of any remedy for obvious wrongs, the considerations noted above lead me to affirm the judgment below, despite the complex problems identified in the dissent.  <em>Cf. New York Tel. Co. v. New York State Labor Dept.,</em> 440 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/case.html#549">440 U. S. 549</a></span> (concurring opinion) (evidence indicated that Congress decided to tolerate interference with labor law policies caused by unemployment insurance laws).  I am not persuaded by the dissent\'s argument that the <em>Machinists</em> doctrine bars respondents\' causes of action, for I do not believe that</p>\n<p>"Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left \'to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html">427 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#140">427 U. S. 140</a></span> (1976), quoting <em>NLRB v.

Unlike the self-help weapon at issue in <em>Machinists,</em> promising permanent employment to strike replacements involves offering to obligate oneself to third parties and inducing their reliance on that offer.  In <em>Machinists,</em> the union\'s refusal to work overtime did not involve the rights and duties of anyone but the union and the employer. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s suggestion that a state action for misrepresentation would frustrate the policies of the Act by making employers more hesitant to promise permanent employment, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 463 U.

S. 536</a></span>-538, assumes that, under the federal scheme, the employer is not meant to hesitate.  But I believe that the hesitation engendered by potential contract damages and damages for misrepresentation is as consistent with federal law as it is with common sense and decency.  The "free play of economic forces" contemplated by <em>Machinists</em> is the clash of weapons used by employer and union against one another.  The free play of economic forces does not control one party\'s pursuit of its goals through imposition of harms on persons external to the dispute, because the economic contest creates no incentive for the other party to impose sanctions for such conduct.  In the absence of protection for third parties\' rights, the free play of economic forces actually is distorted; the economic cost of a weapon is understated. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Much more troubling is the dissent\'s argument that the state law action will discourage the settlement of strikes.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#523">463 U. S. 532</a></span>-533.  I agree that, where the employer has chosen to promise permanent employment to strike replacements, its potential liability to them would make the employer reluctant to settle by giving the strikers their old jobs.  This problem, it seems to me, is inherent in Congress\' choice to permit employers to offer permanent employment in order to obtain replacements.  The potential dilemma is one the employer must consider at the time it chooses whether to promise permanent employment.  If it makes no promises, settlement will not be impeded. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 463 U. S. 522</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, I cannot agree that the doctrine of <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span> (1959), preempts respondents\' contract action.  Of course, if the strike is an unfair labor practice strike and the employer has offered permanent employment to the replacements, federal labor law requires the employer to dismiss the replacements in derogation of his promise.

S. 530</a></span>-531, n. 2, that conduct is "arguably required" does not necessarily mean it is "arguably protected" within the meaning of <em>Garmon.</em>  Federal law did not require the employer to make the promise or to commit unfair labor practices.  Moreover, as discussed above, once the promises are made and relied upon, I believe that federal law presumes they are in some manner enforceable.  If federal law recognizes that the employer voluntarily has undertaken an obligation to the replacements, the fact that the employer commits an unfair labor practice making it impossible for it to fulfill that obligation should not shield the employer from compensating the replacement employees.  <em>Cf. W. R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Rubber Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/757/case.html">461 U. S. 757</a></span> (1983).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>I fully recognize that this view may appear to put the employer between Scylla and Charybdis.  Neither the Court\'s approach nor the dissent\'s, however, provides the employer with a safer harbor.  The Court\'s concept of a conditional promise will not help the employer attract replacements, and if the employer wishes to make a meaningful promise, the Court\'s opinion leaves the employer just where my approach </p><p><a class="page-number" name="523">Page 463 U. S. 523</a></p><p> would.  And by draining all legal meaning from the promise of permanence, the dissent\'s approach leaves employers unable to attract any but the most gullible and unfortunate of potential replacement employees.</p>\n<p>Although I cannot believe that Congress has reconciled the conflict between the striker\'s right to reinstatement and the employer\'s right to operate its business during a strike by requiring lies and broken promises to strike replacements to go unredressed, Congress certainly is free to prove me wrong.  Congress also is free to resolve the great tensions inherent in this complex three-way struggle entirely within the framework of federal law.  Certainly, some form of federal regulation of promises of permanent employment is the most desirable solution to the perplexing problem before the Court, because it would provide both consistency within federal labor law itself and uniformity throughout the Nation.  At this time, however, it appears to me that the logic of the Act permits respondents\' damages actions.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s suggestion that the employer\'s conditional promise</p>\n<p>"is of great moment if the employer is not found guilty of unfair practices, does not settle with the union, or settles without a promise to reinstate,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#503">463 U. S. 503</a></span>, ignores the significant fact that this is the one situation for which a strike replacement would not need reassurances.  An employer that refuses to reinstate strikers as a part of a strike settlement, when it could have demanded concessions from the union in exchange, is unlikely to fire the replacements and reinstate strikers unilaterally.  The Court\'s conditional promise does not relate to potential replacements\' concerns -- that in order to end the strike, the employer will agree with the union to reinstate the strikers at the replacements\' expense.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>As the Court\'s own quotation from <em>Hot Shoppes, Inc.,</em> 146 N.L.R.B. 802 (1964), demonstrates, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#504">463 U. S. 504</a></span>-505, n. 8, that case is not to the contrary.  <em>Hot Shoppes</em> merely holds that, in order to retain strike replacements, the employer need not show in a given case that its offers of permanent employment were motivated by the need to continue the operation of its business.  As <em>Mackay Co.</em> makes clear, the Act gives the employer the right to make such promises because it is presumed that they serve this purpose, 304 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/333/case.html#345">304 U. S. 345</a></span>; the specific motive for a particular offer is irrelevant.  In <em>Hot Shoppes,</em> as in this case, permanent offers were made.  146 N.L.R.B. at 804.  <em>Hot Shoppes</em> obviously does not stand for the proposition that an employer not making an offer of permanent employment in the manner set forth in <em>Covington Furniture</em> may retain replacement employees in preference to strikers.  Yet that is what the Court holds today.</p>\n<p>The Court also quotes incompletely from the Board\'s brief in this Court in an effort to demonstrate that the Board\'s position is "equivocal, at best," and therefore not entitled to deference.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#505">463 U. S. 505</a></span>, n. 8.  The full quote is as follows, and is very clear:</p>\n<p>"An employer <em>could not escape the dilemma</em> posed by the threat of a state court fraud action simply by informing prospective replacements of all the contingencies that might affect their tenure.  In the first place, if an employer were to extend only such a conditional offer, its ability to hire replacement workers quickly would be diminished, and its chief weapon for combatting the employees\' strike pressure would consequently be weakened.  Furthermore, such a conditional offer might well render the replacements only temporary hires, <em>and would mean that the employer would be obligated to reinstate the strikers even if the strike turned out to be an economic one. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p>Brief for NLRB as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 17 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court, and not the Board, reviews state court lawsuits said to conflict with federal law.  Although it is well established that the Board\'s construction of the substantive scope of the NLRA is due deference, I am unaware of any case in which this Court has deferred to the Board\'s views on preemption.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#505">463 U.

There is no evidence, however, that Congress focused on this question.  Absent congressional attention, the Court must construe the Act and determine its impact on state law in light of the wider contours of federal labor policy.  In this case, it appears to me that state enforcement of promises of permanent employment through damages awards for breach of contract and misrepresentation is consistent with the nature of the federal weapon itself.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, Congress has permitted parties to a labor dispute to impose harm on third parties with impunity.  <em>See, e.g., Teamsters v.

"Permanent" strike replacements will have certain rights, but employers will hesitate to make permanent offers; this hesitancy will redound to the benefit of striking unions, but those employers who do make such promises will hesitate to settle with the union on terms involving return of the strikers.  And while the fact that the employer\'s offers of permanent employment are legally meaningful will make them credible, thereby improving the employer\'s ability to attract replacement workers during an economic strike, it also will make the offers more costly, and therefore less attractive, for the employer.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In some respects, this is a difficult case.  Preemption cases in the labor law area are often difficult, because we must decide the questions presented without any clear guidance from Congress.  <em>See Motor Coach Employees v.

This is especially true when the case is an unusual one.  We are not confronted here with a suit between an employer and a union, <em>see e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/180/case.html">436 U.

Such suits are common, and have provided the vehicles for developing the standards we have established in this area.  Rather, we have here a suit brought by former employees of petitioner who allegedly were hired as permanent replacements for striking union members.  Our prior cases, therefore, provide little guidance in this novel area.</p>\n<p>Despite the conceded difficulty of this case, I cannot agree with the Court\'s conclusion that neither respondents\' breach of contract claim nor their misrepresentation claim is preempted by federal law.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#512">463 U. S. 512</a></span>.  In my view, these claims go to the core of federal labor policy.  If respondents are allowed to pursue their claims in state court, employers will be subject to potentially conflicting state and federal regulation of their activities; the efficient administration of the National Labor Relations Act will be threatened; and the structure of the economic weapons Congress has provided to parties to a labor dispute will be altered.  In short, the purposes and policies of federal law will be frustrated.  I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>NLRB v. American Ins.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Prohibiting specific enforcement, but permitting a damages award, does nothing to eliminate the conflict between state and federal law in this context.

"The obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The force of these observations is apparent in this case.  If an employer is confronted with potential liability for discharging workers he has hired to replace striking employees, he is likely to be much less willing to enter into a settlement agreement calling for the dismissal of unfair labor practice charges and for the reinstatement of strikers.  Instead, he is much more likely to refuse to settle and to litigate the charges at issue while retaining the replacements. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Such developments would frustrate the strong federal interest in ending strikes and in settling labor disputes.

There is no sense in which it can be said that federal law required petitioner to misrepresent to respondents the terms on which they were hired.  Permitting respondents to pursue their misrepresentation claim in state court, therefore, does not present the same potential for directly conflicting regulation of employer activity as permitting respondents to pursue their breach of contract claim.  Nor can it be said that petitioner\'s alleged misrepresentation was "arguably protected" under <em>Garmon.</em>  While it is arguable that petitioner\'s alleged offers of permanent employment were prohibited by the Act, and therefore preempted under <em>Garmon, see</em> <l=|463 1|="" 491fn3="" u.s.="">n. 1, <em>supra,</em> careful analysis yields the conclusion that this is not a sufficient ground for preempting respondents\' misrepresentation claim. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  In my view, however, respondents\' misrepresentation claim is preempted under the analysis articulated principally in <em>Machinists v.

During the course of considering a preemption question in <em>Garner,</em> the Court stated:</p>\n<p>"For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits."</p>\n<p>346 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html#500">346 U.

The Court in <em>Machinists</em> described this branch as</p>\n<p>"focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left \'to be controlled by the free play </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 463 U.

Permitting the use of this weapon is part of the balance struck by the Act between labor and management.  There is no doubt that respondents\' misrepresentation claim, involving as it does the potential for substantial employer liability, burdens an employer\'s right to resort to this weapon.  This is especially apparent when one considers the fact that the character of a strike is often unclear.  A strike that starts as an economic strike, during which an employer is entitled to hire permanent replacements that he need not discharge to make way for returning strikers, may be converted into an unfair labor practice strike, in which case the employer loses his right to hire permanent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 463 U.

[<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  Moreover, in order to preserve his right to retain the replacements and to refuse to reinstate returning strikers, the employer must establish that the replacements have been hired on a permanent basis in order to continue his business operations.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#526">463 U.

[<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]</p>\n<p>In order to avoid misrepresentation claims, an employer might decide not to hire replacements on a permanent basis or to hire permanent replacements only in cases in which it is absolutely clear that the strike is an economic one.  Either of these developments would mean that employers were being inhibited by state law from making full use of an economic weapon available to them under federal law.  Moreover, if an employer decided not to hire replacements on a permanent basis, his ability to hire replacements might be affected adversely.  An employer also might decide to disclose to prospective replacements the possibility, even if it is remote, that the strike might be determined to have been an unfair labor practice strike and that he might be ordered to reinstate the strikers and to discharge the replacements.  This course of action, however, might limit an employer\'s ability to hire replacements, and it might have the further effect of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 463 U. S. 538</a></p><p> rendering the replacements temporary under federal law, in which case the strikers would be entitled to reinstatement regardless of the nature of the strike.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#526">463 U. S. 526</a></span>-527.</p>\n<p>Based on this analysis, it is clear that permitting respondents to pursue their misrepresentation claim in state court would limit and substantially burden an employer\'s resort to an economic weapon available to him under federal law.  This would have the inevitable effect of distorting the delicate balance struck by the Act between the rights of labor and management in labor disputes.  For these reasons, respondents\' misrepresentation claim must be preempted. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court rejects the argument that the prospect of misrepresentation claims\' being filed in state court will burden an employer\'s right to hire permanent replacements for employees engaged in an economic strike.  The Court suggests that employers may avoid liability for misrepresentation by conditioning their offers of employment to replacements.  In the Court\'s view, a requirement that employers condition their offers of employment will not have an adverse effect on an employer\'s ability to hire permanent replacements, because, under a system in which an employer is not liable for misrepresentation or breach of contract, his offers are, as a matter of law, conditional.  Honest employers would not make promises that they know they are not obligated to keep, and, in any event, replacements would know that the offers were, in some respects, nonpermanent.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#502">463 U. S. 502</a></span>.  Putting aside the validity of these observations, the Court\'s analysis creates another problem:  a requirement that employers condition their offers to replacements might render the replacements nonpermanent under federal law, and result in employers\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 463 U. S. 539</a></p><p> being required to reinstate returning strikers regardless of the nature of the strike.  The Court acknowledges this problem, and in order to resolve it, changes the law of permanency.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#501">463 U. S. 501</a></span>-504.  The Court states:</p>\n<p>"An employment contract with a replacement promising permanent employment, subject only to settlement with its employees\' union and to a Board unfair labor practice order directing reinstatement of strikers, would not in itself render the replacement a temporary employee subject to displacement by a striker over the employer\'s objection during or at the end of what is proved to be a purely economic strike.  The Board suggests that such a conditional offer \'might\' render the replacements only temporary hires that the employer would be required to discharge at the conclusion of a purely economic strike. . . .  But the permanent hiring requirement is designed to protect the strikers, who retain their employee status and are entitled to reinstatement unless they have been permanently replaced. . . .  [T]he protection is of great moment if the employer is not found guilty of unfair practices, does not settle with the union, or settles without a promise to reinstate.  In that eventuality, the employer, although it has prevailed in the strike, may refuse reinstatement only if it has hired replacements on a permanent basis.  If it has promised to keep the replacements on in such a situation, discharging them to make way for selected strikers whom it deems more experienced or more efficient would breach its contract with the replacements.  Those contracts, it seems to us, create a sufficiently permanent agreement to permit the prevailing employer to abide by its promises."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#503">463 U. S. 503</a></span>-504 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The fact that the Court feels compelled to announce a new standard of "permanency" under federal law highlights the need to preempt respondents\' misrepresentation claim in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="540">Page 463 U. S. 540</a></p><p> this case.  The Court is, in effect, adjusting the balance of power struck by the Act between labor and management.  The right to strike is so central to the Act that an employer can refuse to reinstate returning economic strikers only if he can show a legitimate and substantial business justification for the refusal.  One such justification is the need to offer permanent employment to replacements in order to continue his business operations.  <em>See Fleetwood Trailer Co.,</em> 389 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/375/case.html#378">389 U. S. 378</a></span>-379; <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#526">463 U. S. 526</a></span>.  If the employer has not had to offer employment to replacements on a permanent basis, then there is no justification for refusing to reinstate the strikers.  <em>See NLRB v. Mars Sales &amp; Equipment Co.,</em> 626 F.2d at 572-573; <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#526">463 U. S. 526</a></span>-527.  The Court\'s change in the law of permanency weakens the rights of strikers and undermines the protection afforded those rights by the Act. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="541">Page 463 U. S. 541</a></p><p> Such adjustments in the balance of power between labor and management are for Congress, not this Court. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]</p>\n<p>The real problem in this case, and another factor that supports preemption, is that the words "permanent replacement" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 463 U. S. 542</a></p><p> have a special meaning within the context of federal labor law.  This is not surprising, since the words arise in a context that is at the core of federal labor law:  the use of economic weapons to achieve legitimate bargaining objectives.  Workers hired to replace striking employees on a permanent basis are nonpermanent to the extent that a strike may be determined to have been an unfair labor practice strike and that an employer may be ordered to reinstate strikers.  They are also nonpermanent to the extent that a union may "win" a strike and force an employer to agree to a settlement that requires the reinstatement of striking employees.  But such workers are "permanent" under other circumstances.  There may be situations in which it is reasonably clear that a strike is an economic one and that an employer has a right to hire permanent replacements and to retain them even when the strike has ended.  The employer also may be likely to "win" the strike and to find no need to settle with the union.  Under these circumstances, a prudent employer still might find it necessary to condition his offers of employment to replacements in order to avoid even a remote possibility that he will be faced with potential liability for misrepresentation. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 463 U. S. 543</a></p><p> This would burden his right to hire permanent replacements.  Moreover, changing the law of permanency to accommodate this development compromises the rights of strikers, which are a crucial part of the federal scheme.</p>\n<p>I share the Court\'s concern over the plight of workers hired to replace striking employees.  Contrary to the Court\'s suggestion, however, strikes are, to some extent, "war."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/491/case.html#500">463 U. S. 500</a></span>.  As Judge Learned Hand stated more than 40 years ago in a case involving the reinstatement of strikers:</p>\n<p>"It is of course true that the consequences are harsh to those who have taken the strikers\' places; strikes are always harsh; it might have been better to forbid them in quarrels over union recognition.  But with that we have nothing to do; as between those who have used a lawful weapon and those whose protection will limit its use, the second must yield; and indeed, it is probably true today that most men taking jobs so made vacant realize from the outset how tenuous is their hold."</p>\n<p><em>NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc.,</em> 94 F.2d 862, 871 (CA2 1938).</p>\n<p>It might be a better world if strike replacements were afforded greater protection.  But if accomplishing this end requires an alteration of the balance of power between labor and management or an erosion of the right to strike, this Court should not pursue it. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  This Court\'s notions of what would constitute a more "fair" system are irrelevant to determining whether certain state law claims must be preempted because they interfere with the system of labor-management relations established by Congress. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 463 U.

To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.  Nor has it mattered whether the States have acted through laws of broad general application, rather than laws specifically directed towards the governance of industrial relations.
