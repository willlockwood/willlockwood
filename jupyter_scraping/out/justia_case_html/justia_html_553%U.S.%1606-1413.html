The trial court found that Lexis and Mead were not unitary because they were not functionally integrated or centrally managed and enjoyed no economies of scale.

S. 307</a>, 315.  Because the taxpayer here did business in the taxing State, the inquiry shifts from whether the State may tax to what it may tax.  Under the unitary business principle developed to answer that question, a State need not \xe2\x80\x9cisolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cmay tax an apportioned sum of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s multistate business if the business is unitary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/768/index.html">504 U.

If the value the State wished to tax derived from a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary business\xe2\x80\x9d operated within and without the State, the State could tax an apportioned share of that business\xe2\x80\x99 value instead of isolating the value attributable to the intrastate operation.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Exxon Corp.</em> v. <em>Department of Revenue of Wis.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/207/index.html">447 U. S. 207</a>, 223.  But if the value derived from a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete business enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vt.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/425/index.html">445 U. S. 425</a>, 439, the State could not tax even an apportioned share.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Container Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/index.html">463 U. S. 159</a>, 165\xe2\x80\x93166.  This principle was extended to a multistate business that lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cphysical unity\xe2\x80\x9d of wires or rails but exhibited the \xe2\x80\x9csame unity in the use of the entire property for the specific purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe same elements of value arising from such use,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Adams Express Co.</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/194/index.html">165 U. S. 194</a>, 221; and it has justified apportioned taxation of net income, dividends, capital gain, and other intangibles.  Confronting the problem of how to determine exactly when a business is unitary<em>,</em> this Court found in <em>Allied-Signal </em>that the \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple is not so inflexible that as new [finance] methods \xe2\x80\xa6 and new [business] forms \xe2\x80\xa6 evolve it cannot be modified or supplemented where appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d 504 U. S., at 786, and explained that situations could occur in which apportionment might be constitutional even though \xe2\x80\x9cthe payee and the payor [were] not \xe2\x80\xa6 engaged in the same unitary business,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 787.  In that context, the Court observed that an asset could form part of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business if it served an \xe2\x80\x9coperational rather than an investment function\xe2\x80\x9d in the business, <em>ibid.; </em>and noted that <em>Container Corp</em>., <em>supra, </em>at 180, n.\xc2\xa019, made the same point.

The operational function concept simply recognizes that an asset can be a part of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business even without a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between the \xe2\x80\x9cpayor and payee.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>Allied-Signal </em>and in <em>Corn Products Co.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/46/index.html">350 U. S. 46</a>, the conclusion that an asset served an operational function was merely instrumental to the constitutionally relevant conclusion that the asset was a unitary part of the business conducted in the taxing State rather than a discrete asset to which the State had no claim.  <em>Container Corp.</em> and <em>Allied-Signal</em> did not announce a new ground for constitutional apportionment, and the Illinois Appellate Court erred<em> </em>in concluding otherwise.  Here, where the asset is another business, a unitary relationship\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9challmarks\xe2\x80\x9d are functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale.  See <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 438.  The trial court found each hallmark lacking in finding that Lexis was not a unitary part of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business.  However, the appellate court made no such determination.  Relying on its operational function test, it reserved the unitary business question, which it may take up on remand.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because the alternative ground for affirmance urged by the State and its <em>amici</em>\xe2\x80\x94that the record amply demonstrates that Lexis did substantial business in Illinois and that Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 own contacts with the State suffice to justify the apportionment of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s capital gain\xe2\x80\x94was neither raised nor passed upon in the state courts, it will not be addressed here.  The case for restraint is particularly compelling here, since the question may impact other jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x99 laws.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">371 Ill.

We have been asked in this case to decide whether the State of Illinois constitutionally taxed an apportioned share of the capital gain realized by an out-of-state corporation on the sale of one of its business divisions.  The Appellate Court of Illinois upheld the tax and affirmed a judgment in the State\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Because we conclude that the state courts misapprehended the principles that we have developed for determining whether a multistate business is unitary, we vacate the decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mead Corporation (Mead), an Ohio corporation, is the predecessor in interest and a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner MeadWestvaco Corporation.  From its founding in 1846, Mead has been in the business of producing and selling paper, packaging, and school and office supplies.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1968, Mead paid $6\xc2\xa0million to acquire a company called Data Corporation, which owned an inkjet printing technology and a full-text information retrieval system, the latter of which had originally been developed for the U. S. Air Force.  Mead was interested in the inkjet printing technology because it would have complemented Mead\xe2\x80\x99s paper business, but the information retrieval system proved to be the more valuable asset.  Over the course of many years, Mead developed that asset into the electronic research service now known as Lexis/Nexis (Lexis).  In 1994, it sold Lexis to a third party for approximately $1.5\xc2\xa0billion, realizing just over $1\xc2\xa0billion in capital gain, which Mead used to repurchase stock, retire debt, and pay taxes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mead did not report any of this gain as business income on its Illinois tax returns for 1994.  It took the position that the gain qualified as nonbusiness income that should be allocated to Mead\xe2\x80\x99s domiciliary State, Ohio, under Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 Income Tax Act (ITA).  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.\xc2\xa035, \xc2\xa75/303(a) (West 1994).  The State audited Mead\xe2\x80\x99s returns and issued a notice of deficiency.  According to the State, the ITA required Mead to treat the capital gain as business income subject to apportionment by Illinois.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The State assessed Mead with approximately $4\xc2\xa0million in additional tax and penalties.  Mead paid that amount under protest and then filed this lawsuit in state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case was tried to the bench.  Although the court admitted expert testimony, reports, and other exhibits into evidence, see App. D to Pet. for Cert. 29a\xe2\x80\x9334a, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulations supplied most of the evidence of record regarding Mead\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Lexis, see App. 9\xe2\x80\x9320.  We summarize those stipulations here.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lexis was launched in 1973.  For the first few years it was in business, it lost money, and Mead had to keep it afloat with additional capital contributions.  By the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, as more attorneys began to use Lexis, the service finally turned a profit.  That profit quickly became substantial.  Between 1988 and 1993, Lexis made more than $800\xc2\xa0million of the $3.8\xc2\xa0billion in Illinois income that Mead reported.  Lexis also accounted for $680\xc2\xa0million of the $4.5\xc2\xa0billion in business expense deductions that Mead claimed from Illinois during that period.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lexis was subject to Mead\xe2\x80\x99s oversight, but Mead did not manage its day-to-day affairs.  Mead was headquartered in Ohio, while a separate management team ran Lexis out of its headquarters in Illinois.  The two businesses maintained separate manufacturing, sales, and distribution facilities, as well as separate accounting, legal, human resources, credit and collections, purchasing, and marketing departments.  Mead\xe2\x80\x99s involvement was generally limited to approving Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 annual business plan and any significant corporate transactions (such as capital expenditures, financings, mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures) that Lexis wished to undertake.  In at least one case, Mead procured new equipment for Lexis by purchasing the equipment for its own account and then leasing it to Lexis.  Mead also managed Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 free cash, which was swept nightly from Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 bank accounts into an account maintained by Mead.  The cash was reinvested in Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 business, but Mead decided how to invest it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither business was required to purchase goods or services from the other.  Lexis, for example, was not required to purchase its paper supply from Mead, and indeed Lexis purchased most of its paper from other suppliers.  Neither received any discount on goods or services purchased from the other, and neither was a significant customer of the other.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lexis was incorporated as one of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s wholly owned subsidiaries until 1980, when it was merged into Mead and became one of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s divisions.  Mead engineered the merger so that it could offset its income with Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 net operating loss carryforwards.  Lexis was separately reincorporated in 1985 before being merged back into Mead in 1993.  Once again, tax considerations motivated each transaction.  Mead also treated Lexis as a unitary business in its consolidated Illinois returns for the years 1988 through 1994, though it did so at the State\xe2\x80\x99s insistence and then only to avoid litigation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lexis was listed as one of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness segment[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in at least some of its annual reports and regulatory filings.  Mead described itself in those reports and filings as \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in the electronic publishing business\xe2\x80\x9d and touted itself as the \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloper of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading electronic information retrieval services for law, patents, accounting, finance, news and business information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 93, 59; App. D to Pet. for Cert. 38a.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the stipulated facts and the other exhibits and expert testimony received into evidence, the Circuit Court of Cook County concluded that Lexis and Mead did not constitute a unitary business.  The trial court reasoned that Lexis and Mead could not be unitary because they were not functionally integrated or centrally managed and enjoyed no economies of scale.  <em>Id.,</em> at 35a\xe2\x80\x9336a, 39a.  The court nevertheless concluded that the State could tax an apportioned share of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s capital gain because Lexis served an \xe2\x80\x9coperational purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cLexis/Nexis was considered in the strategic planning of Mead, particularly in the allocation of resources.  The operational purpose allowed Mead to limit the growth of Lexis/Nexis if only to limit its ability to expand or to contract through its control of its capital investment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 38a\xe2\x80\x9339a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed.  <em>Mead Corp.</em> v. <em>Department of Revenue</em>, 371 Ill. App. 3d 108, 861 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 1131 (2007).  The court cited several factors as evidence that Lexis served an operational function in Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business: (1)\xc2\xa0Lexis was wholly owned by Mead; (2)\xc2\xa0Mead had exercised its control over Lexis in various ways, such as manipulating its corporate form, approving significant capital expenditures, and retaining tax benefits and control over Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 free cash; and (3)\xc2\xa0Mead had described itself in its annual reports and regulatory filings as engaged in electronic publishing and as the developer of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading information retrieval service.  See <em>id.,</em> at 111\xe2\x80\x93112, 861 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d, at 1135\xe2\x80\x931136.  Because the court found that Lexis served an operational function in Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business, it did not address the question whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business.  See <em>id.,</em> at 117\xe2\x80\x93118, 861 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d, at 1140.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Supreme Court of Illinois denied review in January 2007.  <em>Mead Corp.</em> v. <em>Illinois Dept. of Revenue</em>, 222 Ill.\xc2\xa02d 609, 862 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 235 (Table).

According to petitioner, the exception for apportionment of income from nonunitary businesses serving an operational function is a narrow one that does not reach a purely passive investment such as Lexis.  We perceive a more fundamental error in the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning.  In our view, the state courts erred in considering whether Lexis served an \xe2\x80\x9coperational purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business after determining that Lexis and Mead were not unitary.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause impose distinct but parallel limitations on a State\xe2\x80\x99s power to tax out-of-state activities.

Cf. <em>Allied-Signal</em>, 504 U. S., at 778 (distinguishing <em>Quill Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>).  To answer that question, we have developed the unitary business principle.  Under that principle, a State need not \xe2\x80\x9cisolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cmay tax an apportioned sum of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s multistate business if the business is unitary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 772; accord, <em>Hunt-Wesson</em>, 528 U.

The court must determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cintrastate and extrastate activities formed part of a single unitary business,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 438\xe2\x80\x93439, or whether the out-of-state values that the State seeks to tax \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98derive[d] from \xe2\x80\x9cunrelated business activity\xe2\x80\x9d which constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete business enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 773 (quoting <em>Exxon Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 224, in turn quoting <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 439 (alteration in original)).  We traced the history of this venerable principle in <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 778\xe2\x80\x93783, and, because it figures prominently in this case, we retrace it briefly here.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the United States witnessed the emergence of its first truly multistate business enterprises.  These railroad, telegraph, and express companies presented state taxing authorities with a novel problem: A State often cannot tax its fair share of the value of a multistate business by simply taxing the capital within its borders.  The whole of the enterprise is generally more valuable than the sum of its parts; were it not, its owners would simply liquidate it and sell it off in pieces.  As we observed in 1876, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he track of the road is but one track from one end of it to the other, and, except in its use as one track, is of little value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Railroad Tax Cases</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/575/index.html">92 U. S. 575</a>, 608.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unitary business principle addressed this problem by shifting the constitutional inquiry from the niceties of geographic accounting to the determination of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s business unit.  If the value the State wished to tax derived from a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary business\xe2\x80\x9d operated within and without the State, the State could tax an apportioned share of the value of that business instead of isolating the value attributable to the operation of the business within the State.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Exxon Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 223 (citing <em>Moorman Mfg. Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 273).  Conversely, if the value the State wished to tax derived from a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete business enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em>, 445 U. S., at 439, then the State could not tax even an apportioned share of that value.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Container Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 165\xe2\x80\x93166.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognized as early as 1876 that the Due Process Clause did not require the States to assess trackage \xe2\x80\x9cin each county where it lies according to its value there.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State Railroad Tax Cases</em>, 92 U. S., at 608.  We went so far as to opine that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t may well be doubted whether any better mode of determining the value of that portion of the track within any one county has been devised than to ascertain the value of the whole road, and apportion the value within the county by its relative length to the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We generalized the rule of the <em>State Railroad Tax Cases</em> in <em>Adams Express Co.</em> v. <em>Ohio, State Auditor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/194/index.html">165 U. S. 194</a> (1897).  There we held that apportionment could permissibly be applied to a multistate business lacking the \xe2\x80\x9cphysical unity\xe2\x80\x9d of wires or rails but exhibiting the \xe2\x80\x9csame unity in the use of the entire property for the specific purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe same elements of value arising from such use.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 221.  We extended the reach of the unitary business principle further still in later cases, when we relied on it to justify the taxation by apportionment of net income, dividends, capital gain, and other intangibles.  See <em>Underwood Typewriter Co.</em> v. <em>Chamberlain</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/254/113/index.html">254 U. S. 113</a>, 117, 120\xe2\x80\x93121 (1920) (net income tax); <em>Bass, Ratcliff &amp; Gretton, Ltd.</em> v. <em>State Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/271/index.html">266 U. S. 271</a>, 277, 280, 282\xe2\x80\x93283 (1924) (franchise tax); <em>J.\xc2\xa0C. Penney Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 443\xe2\x80\x93445 (tax on the \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege of declaring dividends\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 780 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or constitutional purposes capital gains should be treated as no different from dividends\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 1 Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein \xc2\xb68.07[1] (summarizing this history).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the unitary business principle has evolved in step with American enterprise, courts have sometimes found it difficult to identify exactly when a business is unitary.  We confronted this problem most recently in <em>Allied-Signal</em>.  The taxpayer there, a multistate enterprise, had realized capital gain on the disposition of its minority investment in another business.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulation left little doubt that the taxpayer and its investee were not unitary.  See 504 U. S., at 774 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question whether the business can be called \xe2\x80\x98unitary\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 is all but controlled by the terms of a stipulation\xe2\x80\x9d).  The record revealed, however, that the taxpayer had used the proceeds from the liquidated investment in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to purchase a new asset that would have been used in its unitary business.  See <em>id.,</em> at 776\xe2\x80\x93777.  From that wrinkle in the record, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s minority interest had represented nothing more than a temporary investment of working capital awaiting deployment in the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business.  See <em>Bendix Corp.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>, 125 N.\xc2\xa0J. 20, 37, 592 A.\xc2\xa02d 536, 545 (1991).  The State went even further.  It argued that, because there could be \xe2\x80\x9cno logical distinction between short-term investment of working capital, which all concede is apportionable, \xe2\x80\xa6 and all other investments,\xe2\x80\x9d the unitary business principle was outdated and should be jettisoned.  504 U. S., at 784.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We rejected both contentions.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe unitary business principle is not so inflexible that as new methods of finance and new forms of business evolve it cannot be modified or supplemented where appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 786; see also <em>id.,</em> at 785 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf lower courts have reached divergent results in applying the unitary business principle to different factual circumstances, that is because, as we have said, any number of variations on the unitary business theme \xe2\x80\x98are logically consistent with the underlying principles motivating the approach\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Container Corp.</em>, 463 U. S., at 167)).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We explained that situations could occur in which apportionment might be constitutional even though \xe2\x80\x9cthe payee and the payor [were] not \xe2\x80\xa6 engaged in the same unitary business.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U. S.<em>,</em> at 787.  It was in that context that we observed that an asset could form part of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business if it served an \xe2\x80\x9coperational rather than an investment function\xe2\x80\x9d in that business.  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cHence, for example, a State may include within the apportionable income of a nondomiciliary corporation the interest earned on short-term deposits in a bank located in another State if that income forms part of the working capital of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business, notwithstanding the absence of a unitary relationship between the corporation and the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 787\xe2\x80\x93788.  We observed that we had made the same point in <em>Container Corp.</em>, where we noted that \xe2\x80\x9ccapital transactions can serve either an investment function or an operational function.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U. S., at 180, n.\xc2\xa019; cf. <em>Corn Products Refining Co.</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/46/index.html">350 U. S. 46</a>, 50 (1955) (concluding that corn futures contracts in the hands of a corn refiner seeking to hedge itself against increases in corn prices are operational rather than capital assets), cited in <em>Container Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 180, n.\xc2\xa019.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the foregoing history confirms, our references to \xe2\x80\x9coperational function\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Container Corp.</em> and <em>Allied-Signal</em> were not intended to modify the unitary business principle by adding a new ground for apportionment.  The concept of operational function simply recognizes that an asset can be a part of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s unitary business even if what we may term a \xe2\x80\x9cunitary relationship\xe2\x80\x9d does not exist between the \xe2\x80\x9cpayor and payee.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 791\xe2\x80\x93792 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); Hellerstein, State Taxation of Corporate Income from Intangibles: <em>Allied-Signal </em>and Beyond, 48 Tax L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 739, 790 (1993) (hereinafter Hellerstein).  In the example given in <em>Allied-Signal</em>, the taxpayer was not unitary with its banker, but the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s deposits (which represented working capital and thus operational assets) were clearly unitary with the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s business.  In <em>Corn Products</em>, the taxpayer was not unitary with the counterparty to its hedge, but the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s futures contracts (which served to hedge against the risk of an increase in the price of a key cost input) were likewise clearly unitary with the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s business.  In each case, the \xe2\x80\x9cpayor\xe2\x80\x9d was not a unitary part of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s business, but the relevant asset was.  The conclusion that the asset served an operational function was merely instrumental to the constitutionally relevant conclusion that the asset was a unitary part of the business being conducted in the taxing State rather than a discrete asset to which the State had no claim.  Our decisions in <em>Container Corp.</em> and <em>Allied-Signal</em> did not announce a new ground for the constitutional apportionment of extrastate values in the absence of a unitary business.  Because the Appellate Court of Illinois interpreted those decisions to the contrary, it erred.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where, as here, the asset in question is another business, we have described the \xe2\x80\x9challmarks\xe2\x80\x9d of a unitary relationship as functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale.  See <em>Mobil Oil Corp.</em>, 445 U. S., at 438 (citing <em>Butler Brothers</em> v. <em>McColgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/315/501/index.html">315 U. S. 501</a>, 506\xe2\x80\x93508 (1942)); see also <em>Allied-Signal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 783 (same); <em>Container Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 179 (same); <em>F.\xc2\xa0W.

The trial court found each of these hallmarks lacking and concluded that Lexis was not a unitary part of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s business.  The appellate court, however, made no such determination.  Relying on its operational function test, it reserved judgment on whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business.  The appellate court may take up that question on remand, and we express no opinion on it now.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State and its <em>amici</em> argue that vacatur is not required because the judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois may be affirmed on an alternative ground.  They contend that the record amply demonstrates that Lexis did substantial business in Illinois and that Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 own contacts with the State suffice to justify the apportionment of Mead\xe2\x80\x99s capital gain.  See Br. for Respondents 18\xe2\x80\x9325, 46\xe2\x80\x9349; Brief for Multistate Tax Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9329.  The State and its <em>amici</em> invite us to recognize a new ground for the constitutional apportionment of intangibles based on the taxing State\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the capital asset rather than the taxpayer.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decline this invitation because the question that the State and its <em>amici</em> call upon us to answer was neither raised nor passed upon in the state courts.  It also was not addressed in the State\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to the petition.  We typically will not address a question under these circumstances even if the answer would afford an alternative ground for affirmance.  See <em>Glover</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/198/index.html">531 U. S. 198</a>, 205 (2001) (citing <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/638/index.html">503 U.

The States of Ohio and New York, for example, have both adopted the rationale for apportionment that respondents urge us to recognize today.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75733.051(E)\xe2\x80\x93(F) (West 2007 Supp. Pamphlet); N.\xc2\xa0Y.

We need not revisit that question here.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Resolving this question now probably would not spare the State a remand.  The State calculated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability by applying the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax rate to Mead\xe2\x80\x99s apportioned business income, which in turn was calculated by applying Mead\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment percentage to its apportionable business income.  See App. 28; Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.\xc2\xa035, \xc2\xa75/304(a) (West 1994).  But if a constitutionally sufficient link between the State and the value it wishes to tax is founded on the State\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with Lexis rather than Mead, then presumably the apportioned tax base should be determined by applying the State\xe2\x80\x99s four-factor apportionment formula not to Mead but to Lexis.  Naturally, applying the formula to Lexis rather than Mead would yield a different apportionment percentage.  See Brief for Multistate Tax Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18\xe2\x80\x9319, and n.\xc2\xa09; see also Hellerstein 802\xe2\x80\x93803.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Multistate Tax Commission seems to argue that the difference would not affect the result because application of the formula to Lexis would have yielded a higher apportionment percentage.  See Brief for Multistate Tax Commission 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  <em>Amicus</em> argues, in other words, that petitioner has no cause to complain because it caught a break in the incorrect application of a lower apportionment percentage.  <em>Amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99 argument assumes what we are in no position to decide: that Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 own apportioned tax base was properly calculated.  Had petitioner been on notice that Lexis, rather than Mead, would supply the relevant apportionment percentage, it might have persuaded the state courts that Lexis\xe2\x80\x99 apportionment percentage should have been even lower than Mead\xe2\x80\x99s.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s untimely resort to an alternative ground for affirmance may have denied petitioner a fair opportunity to make that argument.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962630">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nMEADWESTVACO CORP.

Despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated holdings that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Due Process and Commerce Clauses forbid the States to tax \xe2\x80\x98extraterritorial values,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1 (quoting <em>Container Corp. of America</em> v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/index.html">463 U. S. 159</a>, 164 (1983)), I am not fully convinced of that proposition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that our decisions addressing state taxation of multistate enterprises rely on the negative Commerce Clause, I would overrule them.  As I have previously explained, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence \xe2\x80\x9chas no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United Haulers Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority</em>, 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases in this area have not, however, rested solely on the Commerce Clause.  The Court has long recognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may also limit States\xe2\x80\x99 authority to tax multistate businesses.  See <em>Adams Express Co.</em> v. <em>Ohio State Auditor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/165/194/index.html">165 U. S. 194</a>, 226 (1897) (concluding that because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he property taxed has its actual situs in the State and is, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction, and  . . . regulation by the state legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d the tax at issue did not \xe2\x80\x9camoun[t] to a taking of property without due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  I agree that the Due Process Clause requires a jurisdictional nexus or, as this Court has stated, \xe2\x80\x9csome definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miller Brothers Co.</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/340/index.html">347 U. S. 340</a>, 344\xe2\x80\x93345 (1954); see <em>ante</em>, at 7.  But apart from that requirement, I am concerned that further constraints\xe2\x80\x94particularly those limiting the <em>degree</em> to which a State may tax a multistate enterprise\xe2\x80\x94require us to read into the Due Process Clause yet another unenumerated, substantive right<em>.</em>  Cf. <em>Troxel</em> v. <em>Granville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/57/index.html">530 U. S. 57</a>, 80 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (leaving open the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cour substantive due process cases were wrongly decided and \xe2\x80\xa6 the original understanding of the Due Process Clause precludes judicial enforcement of unenumerated rights\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court applies the additional requirement that there exist \xe2\x80\x9ca rational relationship between the tax and the values connected with the taxing State.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Moorman Mfg. Co.</em> v. <em>Bair</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/267/index.html">437 U. S. 267</a>, 273 (1978) (requiring that \xe2\x80\x9cthe income attributed to the State for tax purposes . . . be rationally related to \xe2\x80\x98values connected with the taxing State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.</em> v. <em>Missouri Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/390/317/index.html">390 U. S. 317</a>, 325 (1968))).  In my view, however, it is difficult to characterize this requirement as providing an exclusively procedural safeguard against the deprivation of property.  Scrutinizing the amount of multistate income a State may apportion for tax purposes comes perilously close to evaluating the excessiveness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s taxing scheme\xe2\x80\x94a question the Fourteenth Amendment does not grant us the authority to adjudicate.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Stewart Dry Goods Co.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/294/550/index.html">294 U. S. 550</a>, 562 (1935) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo condemn a levy on the sole ground that it is excessive would be to usurp a power vested not in the courts but in the legislature, and to exercise the usurped power arbitrarily by substituting our conceptions of public policy for those of the legislative body\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, divining from the Fourteenth Amendment a right against disproportionate taxation bears a striking resemblance to our long-rejected <em>Lochner</em>-era precedents.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lochner</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/index.html">198 U. S. 45</a>, 56\xe2\x80\x9358 (1905) (invalidating a state statute as an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual \xe2\x80\xa6 to enter into those contracts \xe2\x80\xa6 which may seem to him appropriate or necessary\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in this area is wholly unnecessary given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 undisputed authority to resolve income apportionment issues by virtue of its power to regulate commerce \xe2\x80\x9camong the several States.\xe2\x80\x9d  See U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I believe that the Court should reconsider its constitutional authority to adjudicate these kinds of cases, neither party has asked us to do so here, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today faithfully applies our precedents.  I therefore concur.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
