JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>On September 14, 1977, the Interstate Commerce Commission decided not to exercise its authority under \xc2\xa7 1(8)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) to order a hearing to investigate the lawfulness of a seasonal rate increase proposed by a group of railroads.

We now hold that the Commission\'s "no investigation" decision is not reviewable.</p>\n<p>Petitioner railroads\' rate schedule was the first one proposed under \xc2\xa7 202(d) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the 4-R Act).  90 Stat. 36, amending 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15 (1970 ed.).  <em>See</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 78-597, p. 28a.  That provision directs the Commission to adopt "expeditious procedures for the establishment of railroad rates based on seasonal, regional, or peak-period demand for rail services." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 442 U. S. 449</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In August, 1977, after the Commission had promulgated its new standards and procedures for seasonal rate adjustments, <em>see Ex parte No. 24,</em> 355 I.C.C. 522, the Southern Freight Association proposed a 20% increase in the rates for grain and soybeans shipped from the Midwest in railroad-owned cars between September 15 and December 15, 1977.  The railroads supported their proposal with statistics describing the high volume of grain shipments in the fall, an explanation of the anticipated effect of the temporary rates on railcar usage, and some cost evidence.</p>\n<p>A number of shippers and large users of transported grain (hereinafter shippers) filed protests claiming the proposed rates were unlawful. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  They requested that the Commission exercise its authority under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) to suspend these rates and to investigate the charges of illegality.  On September 14, 1977, a month after the rates were filed and eight days after receiving the protests, the Commission issued its order declining either to suspend or to investigate the legality of the rates.  App. 286-291.</p>\n<p>In that order the Commission admonished the railroads</p>\n<p>"to take prompt action to remove violations of the long- and short-haul provision of section 4(1) of the Act, if any, in connection with inter-territorial and intra-territorial movements that may be caused by application of demand-sensitive rates on whole </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 442 U. S. 450</a></p><p> grains between points in southern territory."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 288.  Moreover, the Commission directed the carriers to file detailed weekly reports relating to the effects of the new schedules, <em>id.</em> at 289-290 (and, in a later order, to keep accounts of all charges and receipts under the rates, <em>id.</em> at 302), and, "out of caution," it instructed its Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement and Bureau of Operations "to closely monitor this matter."  <em>Id.</em> at 290.  With respect to the basic question whether to suspend the rates and conduct a formal investigation, the Commission concluded:</p>\n<p>"Weighing the contentions before us and the clear Congressional purpose to permit experimental ratemaking, we will permit this temporary adjustment to become effective."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 289.  It noted, however, that \xc2\xa7 13(1) of the Act, which allows shippers to initiate mandatory post-effective proceedings to inquire into and remedy violations of the Act, would still be available to "protect" persons aggrieved by the rates. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  App. 289. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 442 U. S. 451</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Immediately after the Commission entered its order, two judges of the Court of Appeals granted an <em>ex parte</em> application for a temporary stay and enjoined the Commission from permitting the tariff to go into effect.  <em>Id.</em> at 95.  Eight days later, however, the court dissolved its stay, and the new rates went into effect.  <em>Id.</em> at 298-300.  Two months after the seasonal tariff had expired, the Court of Appeals filed its opinion concluding that the Commission had begun an investigation but had then erroneously terminated it without "adequately investigat[ing] the charges" of "patent illegality" and without supporting its decision "with appropriate findings and conclusions."  570 F.2d at 1352, 1355, 1356.  It directed the Commission to hold hearings to investigate more fully the protestants\' charges of patent illegality and, if the investigation revealed that the tariff was unlawful, to make appropriate provisions for refund of increased charges collected under the tariff.  <em>Id.</em> at 1356.</p>\n<p>Although some of the just-quoted passages suggest that the Court of Appeals viewed the Commission\'s order as an inadequately investigated decision on the merits, other passages indicate that it reviewed and disapproved of the order, realizing that it was a decision not to reach the merits and not to investigate the lawfulness of the rates.  Because the period covered by the seasonal tariff had already expired, the court first stated that it would not decide whether the Commission\'s refusal to suspend the effectiveness of the rates pending investigation was reviewable.  <em>Id.</em> at 1352.  Assuming, however, that <em>United States v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html">412 U. S. 669</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/669/case.html#698">412 U. S. 698</a></span>, and <em>Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R.

S. 667</a></span>-668, had established that a suspension decision is not reviewable, the court reasoned that the Commission\'s suspension and investigation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="452">Page 442 U. S. 452</a></p><p> powers are separate and distinct, and that the factors that had prompted this Court in <em>Arrow</em></p>\n<p>"to hold suspension orders not reviewable are not applicable to decisions of the Commission to refuse to make or to terminate an investigation of the lawfulness of a proposed tariff."</p>\n<p>570 F.2d at 1353.  It then concluded that the latter type of decision is subject to judicial review even though the former is not, primarily because, in its view, a single \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) proceeding initiated by the Commission is a better means of determining the lawfulness of the rates than numerous \xc2\xa7 13(1) complaint proceedings initiated by shippers contending that they have been overcharged.  570 F.2d at 1355.</p>\n<p>We reverse.  First, to the extent that the Court of Appeals interpreted the Commission\'s order as a final decision that the tariff was lawful, rather than simply a discretionary decision not now to investigate its lawfulness, it has misconstrued the order.  Second, to the extent that its decision transcends this misinterpretation of the Commission\'s order and suggests that even a "no investigation" determination would be reviewable, it has misconstrued Congress\' intent with respect to \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is, of course, true that a decision by the Commission following a \xc2\xa7 15(8) investigation to approve or disapprove a set of rates is a judicially reviewable final decision.  <em>E.g., United States v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html">290 U. S. 70</a></span>.  <em>See Chicago v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/162/case.html">396 U. S. 162</a></span>.  The shippers contend that this rule governs here.  In their view, the Commission, by reviewing and then leaving intact rates it knew to be unlawful, effectively approved those rates.  But the express language of the Commission\'s order belies any interpretation of its decision as a ruling on the legality of petitioner railroads\' seasonal tariff.</p>\n<p>The claim of illegality most forcefully urged by the shippers, both here and in the Court of Appeals, is that the schedules contain a number of violations of the long- and short-haul </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 442 U. S. 453</a></p><p> restrictions in \xc2\xa7 4(1) of the Act.  The Commission did not reject this claim on its merits; on the contrary, it admonished the carriers to correct any such violations that might exist, and directed that records be kept to protect the shippers\' right to recover their damages in such subsequent proceedings as they might bring pursuant to \xc2\xa7 13(1) of the Act.  App. 288-290.  Since the Commission expressly indicated that charges of violation of \xc2\xa7 4(1) could be resolved in \xc2\xa7 13(1) proceedings, App. 289, it is plainly incorrect to interpret its action as a prejudgment of the issue. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission did note in addition that "the evidence offered to support the alleged [\xc2\xa7 4(1)] violations [did] not warrant suspension" or investigation.  <em>Id.</em> at 288.  But, in light of the nature of the inquiry that the Commission makes when a request for suspension and investigation of an area-wide group of rates is filed, this, too, is clearly not a decision that there were no violations.  Since 1910, when \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a)\'s precursor was added to the Act, the Commission has typically made its suspension and investigation decisions simultaneously; indeed, the Act appears to contemplate that result.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/444/case.html#458">442 U. S. 458</a></span>-459.  In addition, the Act leaves the Commission only 30 days to decide on suspension before the rates automatically become effective.  49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6(3).  The Commission\'s primary duty, therefore, is to make a prompt appraisal of the probable and general reasonableness and legality of the proposed schedule -- which may, as in this case, involve thousands of rates for designated commodities and routes -- rather than a detailed review of the lawfulness of each individual component of the tariff schedules. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 442 U. S. 454</a></p><p> short, the Commission simply has no time to, and did not in these cases, finally decide on the lawfulness of the rate schedule or its individual components during the preliminary 30-day period.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Nor can \xc2\xa7 15(8) be read to tolerate judicial review of the Commission\'s decision not to investigate the lawfulness of a proposed rate schedule.  Although we will not lightly interpret a statute to confer unreviewable power on an administrative agency, <em>Morris v. Gressette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html">432 U.

We are not here concerned with the Commission\'s rate-suspension authority, because, as we shall see, our prior cases have already placed the exercise of that authority beyond the control of the courts.  Nor, in fact, are we holding entirely unreviewable the Commission\'s exercise of its rate-investigation authority.  For any shipper may require the Commission to investigate the lawfulness of any rate at any time -- and may secure judicial review of any decision not to do so -- by filing a \xc2\xa7 13(1) complaint.  <em>E.g., ICC v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/25/case.html">194 U. S. 25</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/25/case.html#39">194 U. S. 39</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Instead, our sole concern is the Commission\'s decision not to investigate under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a), a decision that has only two final consequences.  First, the burden of proof with regard to reasonableness is placed on the shipper under \xc2\xa7 13(1), rather than on the carrier, who would have borne it in a \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) proceeding.  (With respect to all other aspects </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 442 U. S. 455</a></p><p> of lawfulness, however, the burden is borne by the shipper in both proceedings.)  Second, the shipper\'s relief, if unlawfulness is proved, is limited under \xc2\xa7 13(1) to actual damages, rather than the full refund of overcharges available under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a).  It is only with regard to these two determinations, neither of which necessarily affects any citizen\'s ultimate rights, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] that we conclude -- based on the language, structure, and history of the Act as well as the relevant case law -- that the agency\'s exercise of discretion is unreviewable.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>With respect to the Commission\'s investigation power, \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) is written in the language of permission and discretion.  Under it,</p>\n<p>"the Commission <em>may,</em> upon the complaint of an interested party or upon its own initiative, order a hearing concerning the lawfulness of [a] rate [which] hearing may be conducted without answer or other formal pleading. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>The statute is silent on what factors should guide the Commission\'s decision; not only is "[t]he extent of this inquiry . . . not . . . marked . . . with certainty," <em>cf. United States v. Louisiana,</em> 290 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/70/case.html#77">290 U. S. 77</a></span>, but also, on the face of the statute, there is simply "no law to apply" in determining if the decision is correct.  <em>Cf. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/case.html">401 U. S. 402</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/402/case.html#410">401 U. S. 410</a></span>. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Similar circumstances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 442 U. S. 456</a></p><p> have been emphasized in cases in which we have inferred nonreviewability.  <em>See Barlow v. Collins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/159/case.html">397 U.

S. 674</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The structure of the Act also indicates that Congress intended to prohibit judicial review.  Congress did not use permissive language such as that found in \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) when it wished to create reviewable duties under the Act.  Instead, it used mandatory language, and it typically included standards to guide both the Commission in exercising its authority and the courts in reviewing that exercise.  In particular, \xc2\xa7 13(1), which plainly authorizes rate investigation decisions that are reviewable, <em>ICC v. Baird, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/194/25/case.html#39">194 U. S. 39</a></span>, provides that,</p>\n<p>"[i]f . . . there shall appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating said complaint, it <em>shall</em> be the duty of the Commission to investigate the matters complained of. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  The Court of Appeals\' interpretation therefore treats \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) as if it were written in the mandatory language of \xc2\xa7 13(1).</p>\n<p>Of even greater significance, that interpretation would allow shippers to use the open-ended and ill-defined procedures in \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) to render obsolete the carefully designed and detailed procedures in \xc2\xa7 13(1).  For under the court\'s reading, at least when one of the perhaps thousands of rates in a proposed schedule is "patently illegal," any party could (and, given the burden of proof and remedial advantages, many surely would) force the Commission immediately to undertake an investigation under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) and to reach a judicially reviewable decision on the legality of the rates.  Nothing would be left for consideration under \xc2\xa7 13(1).  We, of course, are reluctant, almost a century after the Act was passed, to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 442 U. S. 457</a></p><p> adopt an interpretation of it that would effectively nullify one of its original and most frequently used provisions</p>\n<p>The disruptive practical consequences of such a determination confirm our view that Congress intended no such result.  The Commission reviews over 50,000 rate-schedule filings each year; many, including the one involved here, contain thousands of individual rates.  <em>See</em> 91 ICC Ann.Rep. 113 (1977).  If the Commission, which generally makes its \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) investigation decisions within 30 days in order to allow <em>pre</em>-effective suspension, must carefully analyze and explain its actions with regard to each component of each proposed schedule, and if it must increase the number of investigations it conducts, all in order to avoid judicial review and reversal, its workload would increase tremendously.</p>\n<p>These practical effects of reviewability would be especially disruptive in the present context of seasonal rates proposed under \xc2\xa7 202(d) of the 4-R Act.  The policies underlying that provision favor greater freedom of action by the railroads, greater rate flexibility, especially with respect to short-term rates, and more limited supervision by the Commission [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] -- all of which would be disserved if the courts may examine the Commission\'s initial investigation decisions with respect to temporary rate adjustments.  Furthermore, an increase in the number of rate investigations in which the railroad, rather than the challenging party, bears the burden of proof and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 442 U. S. 458</a></p><p> in which the challenger need not prove actual damages before recovering refunds would be out of place in a regulatory system that leaves "the initiative in setting rates . . . with the railroad."  <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R. Co. v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/289/case.html">422 U.

S. 311</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There is an additional structural reason why the Commission\'s investigation decisions are unreviewable.  Section 15(8) was originally included in the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 552.  As adopted, and as it has remained during the ensuing 70 years, the provision has given the Commission the power not only to investigate, but also to suspend, proposed rates.  49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15(8)(b).  Congress phrased the two powers in precisely the same language, and placed the same time limits on the exercise of both.  <em>See Asphalt Roofing Mfg. Assn. v. ICC,</em> 186 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 8-9, 567 F.2d 994, 1001-1002 (1977); n. 2, <em>supra.</em>  The two powers are inextricably linked, because the Commission has no occasion to suspend a rate unless it also intends to investigate it.  <em>See United States v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/500/case.html">426 U.

S. 512</a></span>-513 (<em>Chessie</em>).</p>\n<p>In view of this linkage, we need look no further than our previous decisions concluding that the merits of a suspension decision are not reviewable to find a sufficient answer to the question presented in these cases.  <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history of the Mann-Elkins amendments to the Act also supports nonreviewability.  Prior to the enactment of those amendments, the Commission had no authority to suspend rates or to adjudicate their lawfulness in advance either of their becoming effective or of their being challenged by a private party in a \xc2\xa7 13(1) complaint.  In the years immediately preceding the enactment of the amendments, rapidly rising rates encouraged shippers, with some success, to ask the courts to enjoin unlawful rates before they went into effect.  As a result of the ensuing judicial intervention in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 442 U. S. 460</a></p><p> ratemaking process, the Commission was divested of much of its primary jurisdiction with respect to rates, and the public was subjected to nonuniform rates that depended on whether or not the local district court had issued an injunction.  <em>See</em> 21 ICC Ann. Rep. 9-10 (1907); 22 ICC Ann Rep. 10-12 (1908); 23 ICC Ann. Rep. 6-7 (1909). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>As discussed at greater length in <em>Arrow, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/658/case.html#662">372 U. S. 662</a></span>-672, the adoption of \xc2\xa7 15(8) was designed to avoid these disruptive consequences of judicial interference.  If we should now allow the courts to review \xc2\xa7 15(8) investigation decisions, we would be giving "backhanded approval" to these very same consequences.  372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/658/case.html#664">372 U. S. 664</a></span>.  Judicial review would once again undermine the Commission\'s primary jurisdiction by bringing the courts into the adjudication of the lawfulness of rates in advance of administrative consideration.  As we said in <em>Arrow</em> with respect to judicially mandated rate suspension:</p>\n<p>"A court\'s disposition of an application for [an order directing the Commission to investigate rates] would seem to require at least some consideration of the applicant\'s claim that the carrier\'s proposed rates are unreasonable [or otherwise unlawful].  But such consideration would create the hazard of forbidden judicial intrusion into the administrative domain."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/658/case.html#669">372 U.

Moreover, this allowance for independent judicial appraisal of the reasonableness of rates by every court of appeals in the country might replicate the judicially created "hazard[s] to uniformity" that, along with the courts\' assault on the Commission\'s primary jurisdiction, prompted Congress to pass 15(8) in the first place.  <em>See</em> 372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/658/case.html#671">372 U.

Nonetheless, this Court has indicated on at least two occasions that the decision whether the Commission should commence an investigation under an analogous provision in the Act, \xc2\xa7 13a(1), is committed to the agency\'s discretion, and therefore not reviewable.

Our summary affirmance of that holding in <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/27/case.html">359 U.

[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Under this novel reading of the Act, if a shipper is denied \xc2\xa7 13(1) relief, he not only may appeal that decision to a court of appeals, but also may appeal the Commission\'s earlier decision not to suspend or investigate a rate under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a).</p>\n<p>Although it is true that the \xc2\xa7 13(1) remedy lessens the risk of harm from the Commission\'s initial refusal to investigate or to suspend under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a), <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R.

S. 311</a></span>, it is nonetheless clear that that remedy is independent of \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) proceedings.  First, the language of \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) suggests no linkage to \xc2\xa7 13(1), nor any basis for judicial review at <em>any</em> point in the administrative process.  Second, \xc2\xa7 13(1) has been an independent and self-contained procedure since the Act was first passed in 1887.  When \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) was added some 23 years later, there was no indication that it was intended as an <em>amendment</em> to \xc2\xa7 13(1), rather than as a limited pre-effective and Commission-initiated <em>alternative</em> to the post-effective and shipper-initiated procedures in \xc2\xa7 13(1).  Third, if shippers are encouraged in every case to request investigations under \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a) in order to preserve for later review under \xc2\xa7 13(1) a claim that one was not conducted, and if the Commission\'s decisions are ultimately subjected to review, many of the practical problems </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 442 U.

It is firmly settled that ICC orders suspending rate increases for the statutory period are within the agency\'s sole discretion, and are judicially unreviewable. . . .  The United States and the petitioners urge that a distinction should be drawn between Commission orders refusing to suspend rate increases and those declining to institute an investigation; the latter, they argue, should be held reviewable.  The basic difficulty with this argument is that section [15(8)(a)], which empowers the Commission both to suspend and to investigate proposed rate increases, grants both powers in substantially the same language.  There is therefore no ground, on the basis of the Act, for treating the two powers differently for purposes of reviewability.  We hold that the reviewability of the Commission\'s decision to permit the rate increases in these proceedings to go into effect without suspension or investigation is controlled by the cases holding the Commission\'s decision whether to suspend a rate increase to be unreviewable."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 202(d), codified originally at 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15 (17) and as set forth therein, provides as follows:</p>\n<p>"Within 1 year after February 5, 1976, the Commission shall establish, by rule, standards and expeditious procedures for the establishment of railroad rates based on seasonal, regional, or peak-period demand for rail services.

The standard proposed by the Court of Appeals, which would require an investigation if individual rates are "patently illegal," is equally foreclosed by those cases.  Moreover, like the standard proposed by the Solicitor General, Brief for United States 34 (review for "abuse of discretion or [action] contrary to [Commission\'s] statutory mandate"), it is entirely without support in the statute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>In its declaration of policy with respect to the Title of the 4-R Act that included the precursor of \xc2\xa7 202(d), the Senate Report on that Act stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he purposes of [the Title] include fostering competition among all carriers in order to promote more adequate and efficient transportation and the attractiveness of rail investment, permitting greater railroad price flexibility, promotion of a rate structure more sensitive to variations in demand and separate rates for distinct services, formulation of standards and guidelines for determining adequate revenue levels, and modernizing and clarifying the functions of rate bureaus."</p>\n<p>S.Rep.

In those cases, the Court reaffirmed the conclusion in <em>Arrow</em> and the <em>SCRAP</em> cases "that courts may not independently appraise the reasonableness of rates" -- <em>i.e.,</em> the merits -- in reviewing suspension decisions.  It did, however, "conclude that Congress did not mean to cut off judicial review for [the] limited purpos[e]" of deciding whether the Commission had jurisdiction to suspend the rates in question, <em>i.e.,</em> whether they were "new rates" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a).  <em>See also Schilling v. Rogers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/666/case.html">363 U. S. 666</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/666/case.html#676">363 U. S. 676</a></span>-677 ("different considerations" apply to the reviewability of an agency "refus[al] or fail[ure] to exercise a statutory discretion" than to the reviewability of its decision once it does exercise that discretion).  Here, it is conceded by all that the Commission has authority with respect to rates such as those at issue either to suspend (or investigate) or not to suspend (or investigate) them, and that it has exercised its authority.  The question raised is whether it did so correctly under the particular circumstances involved -- a question that cannot be answered by a reviewing court without "independently apprais[ing] the [lawfulness] of [the] rat[e]."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, the situation in <em>Arrow,</em> in which the courts first held a "no suspension" decision unreviewable, was far more conducive to a finding of reviewability than the situation presented by these cases.  For in <em>Arrow,</em> the parties seeking judicial intervention were competitors of the railroads alleging predatory pricing, rather than shippers alleging excessive pricing.  As such, it was uncertain -- and the Court expressly refused to decide -- whether those complainants had access to the post-effective judicial remedies that are available to shippers such as respondents here.  <em>See</em> 372 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/658/case.html#669">372 U.

In short, it was possible in <em>Arrow,</em> but not here, that nonreviewability would leave the aggrieved party without any judicial remedy at all.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See generally</em> 1 I.

The carrier or carriers filing such notice may discontinue or change any such operation or service pursuant to such notice except as otherwise ordered by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph. . . .  Upon the filing of such notice, the Commission <em>shall have authority</em> during said thirty days\' notice period, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, to enter upon an investigation of the proposed discontinuance or change.  Upon the institution of such investigation, the Commission, by order served upon the carrier or carriers affected thereby at least ten days prior to the day on which such discontinuance or change would otherwise become effective, may require such train or ferry to be continued in operation or service, in whole or in part, pending hearing and decision in such investigation, but not for a longer period than four months beyond the date when such discontinuance or change would otherwise have become effective.  If, after hearing in such investigation whether concluded before or after such discontinuance or change has become effective, the Commission finds that the operation or service of such train or ferry is required by public convenience and necessity and will not unduly burden interstate or foreign commerce, the Commission may by order require the continuance or restoration of operation or service of such train or ferry, in whole or in part, for a period not to exceed one year from the date of such order."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This provision, it should be noted, closely parallels \xc2\xa7 15(8)(a).
