Wellness sought, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaratory judgment from the Bankruptcy Court, contending that a trust Sharif claimed to administer was in fact Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s alter-ego, and that its assets were his personal property and part of his bankruptcy estate.  The Bankruptcy Court eventually entered a default judgment against Sharif.  While Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending in District Court, but before briefing concluded, this Court held that Article III forbids bankruptcy courts to enter a final judgment on claims that seek only to \xe2\x80\x9caugment\xe2\x80\x9d the bankruptcy estate and would otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cexis[t] without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stern</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  After briefing closed, Sharif sought permission to file a supplemental brief raising a <i>Stern </i>objection.  The District Court denied the motion, finding it untimely, and affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  As relevant here, the Seventh Circuit determined that Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Stern </i>objection could not be waived because it implicated structural interests and reversed on the alter-ego claim, holding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked constitutional authority to enter final judgment on that claim.   </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate <i>Stern</i> claims with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 knowing and voluntary consent.

There, the Court held that the right to adjudication before an Article III court is \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore \xe2\x80\x9csubject to waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 848.  The Court also recognized that if Article III\xe2\x80\x99s structural interests as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are implicated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 850\xe2\x80\x93851.  The importance of consent was reiterated in two later cases involving the Federal Magistrates Act\xe2\x80\x99s assignment of non-Article III magistrate judges to supervise <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> in felony trials.  In <i>Gomez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n490 U. S. 858\n, the Court held that a magistrate judge was not permitted to select a jury without the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent, <i>id.,</i> at 864.  But in <i>Peretz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n501 U. S. 923\n, the Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent significantly changes the constitutional analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 932.  Because an Article III court retained supervisory authority over the process, the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cno structural protections .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. implicated\xe2\x80\x9d and upheld the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s action.  <i>Id.,</i> at 937.

Bankruptcy judges are appointed and may be removed by Article III judges, see 28 U. S.

Bankruptcy courts hear matters solely on a district court\xe2\x80\x99s reference, \xc2\xa7157(a), and possess no free-floating authority to decide claims traditionally heard by Article III courts, see <i>Schor</i>, 478 U.

Moreover, expanding <i>Stern</i> to hold that a litigant may not waive the right to an Article III court through consent would be inconsistent with that opinion\xe2\x80\x99s own description of its holding as \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98narrow\xe2\x80\x99 one\xe2\x80\x9d that did \xe2\x80\x9cnot change all that much\xe2\x80\x9d about the division of labor between district and bankruptcy courts.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___.

The relationship quickly soured, and in 2005, Sharif sued Wellness in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  Sharif repeatedly ignored Wellness\xe2\x80\x99 discovery requests and other litigation obligations, resulting in an entry of default judgment for Wellness.  The District Court eventually sanctioned Sharif by awarding Wellness over $650,000 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  This case arises from Wellness\xe2\x80\x99 long-running\xe2\x80\x94and so far unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x94efforts to collect on that judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In February 2009, Sharif filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the Northern District of Illinois.  The bankruptcy petition listed Wellness as a creditor.  Wellness requested documents concerning Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s assets, which Sharif did not provide.  Wellness later obtained a loan application Sharif had filed in 2002, listing more than $5 million in assets.  When confronted, Sharif informed Wellness and the Chapter 7 trustee that he had lied on the loan application.  The listed assets, Sharif claimed, were actually owned by the Soad Wattar Living Trust (Trust), an entity Sharif said he administered on behalf of his mother, and for the benefit of his sister.  Wellness pressed Shariffor information on the Trust, but Sharif again failed to respond.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Wellness filed a five-count adversary complaint against Sharif in the Bankruptcy Court.  See App. 5\xe2\x80\x9322.  Counts I\xe2\x80\x93IV of the complaint objected to the discharge of Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s debts because, among other reasons, Sharif had concealed property by claiming that it was owned by the Trust.  Count V of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the Trust was Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s alter ego and that its assets should therefore be treated as part of Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate.  <i>Id</i>., at 21.

Wellness responded by filing a motion for sanctions, or, in the alternative, to compel discovery.  Granting the motion to compel, the Bankruptcy Court warned Sharif that if he did not respond to Wellness\xe2\x80\x99 discovery requests a default judgment would be entered against him.  Sharif eventu-ally complied with some discovery obligations, but did not produce any documents related to the Trust.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In July 2010, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling finding that Sharif had violated the court\xe2\x80\x99s discovery order.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a\xe2\x80\x93120a.  It accordingly denied Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s request to discharge his debts and entered a default judgment against him in the adversary proceeding.  And it declared, as requested by count V of Wellness\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, that the assets supposedly held by the Trust were in fact property of Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate because Sharif \xe2\x80\x9ctreats [the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s] assets as his own prop-erty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 119a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sharif appealed to the District Court.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which Congress had authorized to hear customer complaints against commodities brokers, issued a regulation allowing itself to hear state-law counterclaims as well.  William Schor filed a complaint with the CFTC against his broker, and the broker, which had previously filed claims against Schor in federal court, refiled them as counterclaims in the CFTC proceeding.  The CFTC ruled against Schor on the counterclaims.  This Court upheld that ruling against both statutory and constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the constitutional question (the one relevant here) the Court began by holding that Schor had \xe2\x80\x9cwaived any right he may have possessed to the full trial of [the broker\xe2\x80\x99s] counterclaim before an Article III court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 849.  The Court then explained why this waiver legitimated the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of authority: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a personal right, Article III\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of an impartial and independent federal adjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other per-sonal constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such as the right to a jury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal matters must be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 848\xe2\x80\x93849.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court went on to state that a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of his \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal right\xe2\x80\x9d to an Article III court is not always dispositive because Article III \xe2\x80\x9cnot only preserves to litigants their interest in an impartial and independent federal adjudication of claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , but also serves as \xe2\x80\x98an inseparable element of the constitutional system of checks and balances.\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

In such circumstances, separation of powers concerns are diminished, for it seems self-evident that just as Congress may encourage parties to settle a dispute out of court or resort to arbitration without impermissible incursions on the separation of powers, Congress may make available a quasi-judicial mechanism through which willing parties may, at their option, elect to resolve their differences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 855.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The option for parties to submit their disputes to a non-Article III adjudicator was at most a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>de minimis</i>\xe2\x80\x9d infringement on the prerogative of the federal courts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 856.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A few years after <i>Schor</i>, the Court decided a pair of cases\xe2\x80\x94<i>Gomez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 858 (1989)\n, and <i>Peretz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 923 (1991)\n\xe2\x80\x94that reiterated the importance of consent to the constitutional analysis.  Both cases concerned whether the Federal Magistrates Act authorized magistrate judges to preside over jury selection in a felony trial;[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>] the difference was that Peretz consented to the practice while Gomez did not.  That difference was dispositive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Gomez</i>, the Court interpreted the statute as not allowing magistrate judges to supervise <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire </i>without consent, emphasizing the constitutional concerns that might otherwise arise.  See 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 864.  In <i>Peretz</i>, the Court upheld the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s action, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent significantly changes the constitutional analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 932.  The Court concluded that allowing a magistrate judge to supervise jury selection\xe2\x80\x94with consent\xe2\x80\x94does not violate Article III, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9clitigants may waive their personal right to have an Article III judge preside over a civil trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 936 (citing <i>Schor</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 848), and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most basic rights of criminal defendants are similarly subject to waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 936.  And \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven assuming that a litigant may not waive structural protections provided by Article III,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court found \xe2\x80\x9cno such structural protections .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. implicated by\xe2\x80\x9d a magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s supervision of <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cMagistrates are appointed and subject to removal by Article III judges.

The decision whether to empanel the jury whose selection a magistrate has supervised also remains entirely with the district court.  Because \xe2\x80\x98the entire process takes place under the district court\xe2\x80\x99s total control and jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x99 there is no danger that use of the magistrate involves a \xe2\x80\x98congressional attemp[t] \xe2\x80\x9cto transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of emasculating\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 937 (citations omitted; alteration in original).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The lesson of <i>Schor</i>, <i>Peretz</i>, and the history that preceded them is plain: The entitlement to an Article III adjudicator is \xe2\x80\x9ca personal right\xe2\x80\x9d and thus ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9csubject to waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Schor</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 848.

That case concerned the interpretation of \xc2\xa7636(c), which authorizes magistrate judges to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  The specific question in <i>Roell</i> was whether, as a statutory matter, the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d required by \xc2\xa7636(c) had to be express.  The dissent argued that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eading \xc2\xa7636(c)(1) to require express consent not only is more consistent with the text of the statute, but also\xe2\x80\x9d avoids constitutional concerns by \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that the parties knowingly and voluntarily waive their right to an Article III judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 595 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  But the majority\xe2\x80\x94thus placed on notice of the constitutional concern\xe2\x80\x94was untroubled by it, opining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Article III right is substantially honored\xe2\x80\x9d by permitting waiver based on \xe2\x80\x9cactions rather than words.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.,</i> at 589, 590.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The implied consent standard articulated in <i>Roell</i> supplies the appropriate rule for adjudications by bankruptcy courts under \xc2\xa7157.

It bears emphasizing, however, that a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s consent\xe2\x80\x94whether express or implied\xe2\x80\x94must still be knowing and voluntary.  <i>Roell</i> makes clear that the key inquiry is whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe litigant or counsel was made aware of the need for consent and the right to refuse it, and still voluntarily appeared to try the case\xe2\x80\x9d before the non-Article III adjudicator.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>id.,</i> at 588, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9cnotification of the right to refuse\xe2\x80\x9d adjudication by a non-Article III court \xe2\x80\x9cis a prerequisite to any inference of consent\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It would be possible to resolve this case by determining whether Sharif in fact consented to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of count V of Wellness\xe2\x80\x99 adversary complaint.

See <i>Stern</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  I write separately to highlight a few questions touching on the consent issue that merit closer attention than either the Court or The Chief Justice gives them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I agree with The Chief Justice that individuals cannot consent to violations of the Constitution, but this principle has nothing to do with whose interest the violated provision protects.  Anytime the Federal Government acts in a manner inconsistent with the separation of powers, it acts in excess of its constitutional authority.  That authority is carefully defined by the Constitution, and, except through Article V\xe2\x80\x99s amendment process, that document does not permit individuals to bestow additional power upon the Government.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority today authorizes non-Article III courts to adjudicate, with consent, claims that we have held to require an exercise of the judicial power based on its assessment that few \xe2\x80\x9cstructural interests\xe2\x80\x9d are implicated by consent to the adjudication of <i>Stern </i>claims.  See <i>ante,</i> at 7, 12.  That reasoning is flawed.  It matters not whether <i>we</i> think the particular violation threatens the structure of our Government.  Our duty is to enforce the Constitution as written, not as revised by private consent, innocuous or otherwise.  Worse, amidst the tempest over whether \xe2\x80\x9cstructural interests\xe2\x80\x9d are implicated when an individual consents to adjudication of <i>Stern</i> claims by a non-Article III court, both the majority and The Chief Justice fail to grapple with the antecedent question: whether a violation of the Constitution has actually occurred.  That question is a difficult one, and the majority makes a grave mistake by skipping over it in its quest to answer the question whether consent can authorize a constitutional violation.  Because I would resolve this case on narrower grounds, I need not decide that question here.  I nevertheless write separately to highlight the complexity of the issues the majority simply brushes past.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cThe principle, that [the Federal Government] can exercise only the powers granted to it, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is now universally admitted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  A corollary to this principle is that each branch of the Government is limited to the exercise of those powers granted to it.  Every violation of the separation of powers thus involves an exercise of power in excess of the Constitution.  And because the only authorities capable of granting power are the Constitution itself, and the people acting through the amendment process, individual consent cannot authorize the Government to exceed constitutional boundaries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This does not mean, however, that consent is invariably irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  Although it may not authorize a constitutional violation, consent may prevent one from occurring in the first place.  This concept is perhaps best understood with the example on which the majority and The Chief Justice both rely: the right to a jury trial.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9 (majority opinion); <i>ante, </i>at 11 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Although the Government incurably contravenes the Constitution when it acts in <i>violation</i> of the jury trial right, our precedents permit the Government to convict a criminal defendant without a jury trial when he waives that right.

The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver is thus a form of consent that lifts a limitation on government action by satisfying its terms\xe2\x80\x94that is,<i> </i>the right is exercised and honored, not disregarded.

Provided the Government otherwise acts within its powers, there is no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Consent to the adjudication of <i>Stern </i>claims by bankruptcy courts is a far more complex matter than waiver of a jury trial.  Two potential violations of the separation of powers occur whenever bankruptcy courts adjudicate <i>Stern </i>claims.  First, the bankruptcy courts purport to exercise power that the Constitution vests exclusively in the judiciary, even though they are not Article III courts because bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure and salary protections required by Article III.  See Art. III, \xc2\xa71.  Second, the bankruptcy courts act pursuant to statutory authorization that is itself invalid.  For even when acting pursuant to an enumerated power, such as the bankruptcy power, Congress exceeds its authority when it purports to authorize a person or entity to perform a function that requires the exercise of a power vested elsewhere by the Constitution.  See <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n472 (2001)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather than attempt to grapple with these problems, the majority seizes on some statements from <i>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i> v. <i>Schor</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833 (1986)\n, to resolve the difficult constitutional issue before us.  See <i>ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  But to the extent <i>Schor</i> suggests that individual consent could authorize non-Article III courts to exercise the judicial power, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 850\xe2\x80\x93851, it was wrongly decided and should be abandoned.  Consent to adjudication by non-Article III judges may waive\xc2\xa0whatever individual right to impartial adjudication Article III implies, thereby lifting that affirmative barrier on Government action.  But non-Article III courts must still act within the bounds of their constitutional authority.  That is, they must act through a power properly delegated to the Federal Government and not vested by the Constitution in a different governmental actor. Because the judicial power is vested exclusively in Article III courts, non-Article III courts may not exercise it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Schor</i>\xe2\x80\x99s<i> </i>justification for authorizing such a transgression was that it judged the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effect [the allocation would] have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary\xe2\x80\x9d not to be too great.  <i>Id.,</i> at 851.

Our Constitution is not a matter of convenience, to be invoked when we feel uncomfortable with some Government action and cast aside when we do not.

In order to answer that question, we must consider what form of governmental power that type of adjudication requires and whether bankruptcy courts are qualified to exercise that power.  <i>Department of Transportation</i> v. <i>Association of American Railroads</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 24 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many Government functions \xe2\x80\x9cmay be performed by two or more branches without either exceeding its enumerated powers under the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 4.  Certain core functions, however, demand the exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial power, and their allocation is controlled by the Vesting Clauses contained in the first three articles of the Constitution.  <i>Ibid.</i>  We have already held that adjudicating <i>Stern </i>claims, at least <i>without</i> consent of the parties, requires an exercise of the judicial power vested exclusively in Article III courts.  <i>Stern</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329).  The difficult question presented by this case, which the Court glosses over, is whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent somehow transforms the nature of the power exercised.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the concepts were understood at the time of the\nfounding, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers played different roles in the resolution of cases and controversies.  In this context, the judicial power is the power \xe2\x80\x9cto determine all differences according to the established law\xe2\x80\x9d; the legislative power is the power to make that \xe2\x80\x9cestablished law\xe2\x80\x9d; and the executive power is the power \xe2\x80\x9cto back and support the sentence, and to give it due execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7124\xe2\x80\x93126, pp.\xc2\xa062\xe2\x80\x9363 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke); see also <i>Wayman</i> v. <i>Southard</i>, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It should be immediately apparent that consent does not transform the adjudication of <i>Stern </i>claims into a function that requires the exercise of legislative or executive power.  Parties by their consent do not transform the function of adjudicating controversies into the functions of creating rules or enforcing judgments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The more difficult question is whether consent somehow eliminates the need for an exercise of the judicial power.  Our precedents reveal that the resolution of certain cases or controversies requires the exercise of that power, but that others \xe2\x80\x9cmay or may not\xe2\x80\x9d be brought \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the cognizance of [Article III courts], as [Congress] deem[s] proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> v. <i>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</i>, 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).  The distinction generally has todo with the types of rights at issue.  Disposition of private rights to life, liberty, and property falls within the core of the judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights does not.  From that core of the judicial power, we have identified two narrow historical exceptions.  Those exceptions, along with the treatment of cases or controversies not falling within that core, provide useful guidance for understanding whether bankruptcy courts\xe2\x80\x99 adjudication of <i>Stern </i>claims with the consent of the parties requires the exercise of Article III judicial power.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under our precedents, the three categories of cases that may be adjudicated by Article III courts but that do not demand the exercise of the judicial power are those arising in the territories, those arising in the Armed Forces, and those involving public-rights disputes.  <i>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</i>,\n\n458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50\n\xe2\x80\x9367 (1982) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first two represent unique historical exceptions that tell us little about the overall scope of the judicial power.  From an early date, this Court has long upheld laws authorizing the adjudication of cases arising in the territories in non-Article III \xe2\x80\x9cterritorial courts\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that such courts exercise power \xe2\x80\x9cconferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which [Congress] possesses over the territories of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>356 Bales of Cotton</i>, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828) (<i>Canter</i>).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  And the Court has upheld laws authorizing the adjudication of cases arising in the Armed Forces in non-Article III courts-martial, inferring from a constellation of constitutional provisions that Congress has the power to provide for the adjudication of disputes among the Armed Forces it creates and that Article III extends only to <i>civilian</i> judicial power.  <i>Dynes</i> v. <i>Hoover</i>, 20 How. 65, 78\xe2\x80\x9379 (1858).  Whatever their historical validity, these precedents exempt cases arising in the territories and in the land and naval forces from Article III because of other provisions of the Constitution, not because of the definition of judicial power in Article III itself.  See Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 559, 576 (2007) (noting that both exceptions enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cspecial textual rationales that d[o] not spill over into otherareas\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The third category consists of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  Unlike the other two categories, which reflect carve-outs from the core of the judicial power, this cate-gory describes cases outside of that core and therefore has more to tell us about the scope of the judicial power.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distinction between disputes involving \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d and those involving \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d is longstanding, but the contours of the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine have been the source of much confusion and controversy.  See generally <i>Granfinanciera</i>, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66\xe2\x80\x9370 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (tracing the evolution of the doctrine).  Our cases attribute the doctrine to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s mid-19th century decision, <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In that case, the Court observed that there are certain cases addressing \xe2\x80\x9c<i>public rights</i>, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 284 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Historically, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>public</i> rights\xe2\x80\x9d were understood as \xe2\x80\x9crights belonging to the people at large,\xe2\x80\x9d as distinguished from \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>private</i> unalienable rights of each individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Lans-ing</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 4 Wend. 9, 21 (N.\xc2\xa0Y. 1829) (Walworth, C.).  This distinction is significant to our understanding of Article III, for while the legislative and executive branches may dispose of public rights at will\xe2\x80\x94including through non-Article III adjudications\xe2\x80\x94an exercise of the judicial power is required \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the government want[s] to act authoritatively upon core private rights that had vested in a particular individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nelson, <i>supra,</i> at 569; see <i>B&amp;B Hardware, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hargis Industries, Inc.</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 11 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distinction was well known at the time of the founding.  In the tradition of John Locke, William Blackstone in his Commentaries identified the private rights to life, liberty, and property as the three \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute\xe2\x80\x9d rights\xe2\x80\x94so called because they \xe2\x80\x9cappertain[ed] and belong[ed] to particular men .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. merely as individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cto them as members of society [or] standing in various relations to each other\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, not dependent upon the will of the government.  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 119 (1765) (Commentaries); see also Nelson, <i>supra,</i> at 567.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Public rights, by contrast, belonged to \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Commentaries 5 (1769); see also Nelson, <i>supra,</i> at 567.  As the modern doctrine of the separation of powers emerged, \xe2\x80\x9cthe courts became identified with the enforcement of private right, and administrative agencies with the execution of public policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jaffe, The Right to Judicial Review I, 71 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 401, 413 (1958).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Founders carried this idea forward into the Vesting Clauses of our Constitution.  Those Clauses were understood to play a role in ensuring that the federal courts alone could act to deprive individuals of private rights because the power to act conclusively against those rights was the core of the judicial power.  As one early treatise explained, the judiciary is \xe2\x80\x9cthat department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the constitution especially confided.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 St. George Tucker, Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries, App. 357 (1803).  If \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d were not thought to fall within the core of the judicial power, then that could explain why Congress would be able to perform or authorize non-Article III adjudications of public rights without transgressing Article III\xe2\x80\x99s Vesting Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nineteenth-century American jurisprudence confirms that an exercise of the judicial power was thought to be necessary for the disposition of private, but not public, rights.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  See <i>B&amp;B Hardware</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 12.  The treatment of land patents illustrates the point well: Although Congress could authorize executive agencies to dispose of <i>public</i> rights in land\xe2\x80\x94often by means of adjudicating a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for a land grant under a statute\xe2\x80\x94the United States had to go to the courts if it wished to revoke a patent.  See generally Nelson, 107 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev.<i>,</i> at 577\xe2\x80\x93578 (discussing land patents).  That differential treatment reflected the fact that, once \xe2\x80\x9clegal title passed out of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the patent \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ndoubtedly\xe2\x80\x9d constituted \xe2\x80\x9ca vested right\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently could \xe2\x80\x9conly be divested according to law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Towsley</i>, 13 Wall. 72, 84\xe2\x80\x9385 (1871).  By contrast, a party who sought to protect only a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic right\xe2\x80\x9d in the land had no such vested right and could not invoke the intervention of Article III courts.  See <i>Smelting Co.</i> v. <i>Kemp</i>,\n\n104 U.\xc2\xa0S. 636,\n647 (1882)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not lie in the mouth of a stranger to the title to complain of the act of the government with respect to it\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Bagnell</i> v. <i>Broderick</i>, 13 Pet. 436, 450 (1839) (refusing to examine the propriety of a land patent on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has the sole power to declare the dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Over time, the line between public and private rights has blurred, along with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the judicial power.  See <i>B&amp;B Hardware</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 12.  The source of the confusion may be <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>\xe2\x80\x94the putative source of the public rights doctrine itself.  Dictum in the case muddles the distinction between private and public rights, and the decision is perhaps better read as an expression of the principle of sovereign immunity.  <i>Granfinanciera</i>, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 68\xe2\x80\x9369 (opinion of Scalia, J.).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Some cases appear to have done just that, thus reading <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> to apply only in disputes arising between the Government and others.  See, <i>e.g., Crowell</i> v. <i>Benson</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22,\n50 (1932)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another strain of cases has confused the distinction between private and public rights, with some cases treating public rights as the equivalent of private rights entitled to full judicial review, <i>American School of Magnetic Healing</i> v. <i>McAnnulty</i>,\n\n187 U.\xc2\xa0S. 94,\n108 (1902)\n, and others treating what appear to be private rights as public rights on which executive action could be conclusive, see, <i>e.g., Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co.</i> v. <i>Adkins</i>,\n\n310 U.\xc2\xa0S. 381\n\xe2\x80\x93404 (1940); see also <i>B&amp;B Hardware</i>, <i>ante</i>, at 12 (observing that <i>Sunshine Anthracite</i> may reflect a unique historical exception for tax cases).  Cf. <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 84\xe2\x80\x9385 (plurality opinion) (discussing other cases that appear to reflect the historical distinction between private rights and rights created by Congress).  Perhaps this confusion explains why the Court has more recently expanded the concept of public rights to include any right \xe2\x80\x9cso closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 568\n\xe2\x80\x93594 (1985).  A return to the historical understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights,\xe2\x80\x9d however, would lead to the conclusion that the inalienable core of the judicial power vested by Article III in the federal courts is the power to adjudicate <i>private</i> rights disputes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although Congress did not enact a permanent federal bankruptcy law until the late 19th century, it has assigned the adjudication of certain bankruptcy disputes to non-Article III actors since as early as 1800.  Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L.\xc2\xa0J. 567, 608 (1998) (describing the bankruptcy powers vested by Congress in non-Article III judges).  Modern bankruptcy courts, however, adjudicate a far broader array of disputes than their earliest historical counterparts.  And this Court has remained carefully noncommittal about the source of their authority to do so.  See <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 71 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying the historical categories of cases discussed above, one can understand why.  Bankruptcy courts clearly do not qualify as territorial courts or courts-martial, but they are not an easy fit in the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d category, either.  No doubt certain aspects of bankruptcy involve rights lying outside the core of the judicial power.  The most obvious of these is the right to discharge, which a party may obtain if he satisfies certain statutory criteria.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Discharge is not itself a private right, but, together with the claims allowance process that precedes it, it can act conclusively on the core private rights of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s creditors.  We have nevertheless implicitly recognized that the claims allowance process may proceed in a bankruptcy court, as can any matter that would necessarily be resolved by that process, even one that affects core private rights.  <i>Stern</i>, 564<i> </i>U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 30\xe2\x80\x9331).  For this reason, bankruptcy courts and their predecessors more likely enjoy a unique, textually based exception, much like territorial courts and courts-martial do.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (Scalia, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  That is, Article I\xe2\x80\x99s Bankruptcy Clause serves to carve cases and controversies traditionally subject to resolution by bankruptcy commissioners out of Article III, giving Congress the discretion, within those historical boundaries, to provide for their resolution outside of Article III courts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because <i>Stern</i> claims by definition fall outside of the historical boundaries of the bankruptcy carve-out, they are subject to Article III.  This means that, if their adjudication requires the exercise of the judicial power, then only Article III courts may perform it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although <i>Stern </i>claims indisputably involve private rights, the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine suggests a way in which party consent may transform the function of adjudicating <i>Stern</i> claims into one that does not require the exercise of the judicial power.  The premise of the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, as described above, is not that public rights affirmatively require adjudication by some other governmental power, but that the Government has a freer hand when private rights are not at issue.  Accordingly, this premise may not require the presence of a public right at all, but may apply equally to any situation in which private rights are not asserted.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Party consent, in turn, may have the effect of lifting that \xe2\x80\x9cprivate rights\xe2\x80\x9d bar, much in the way that waiver lifts the bar imposed by the right to a jury trial.  Individuals may dispose of their own private rights freely, without judicial intervention.  A party who consents to adjudication of a <i>Stern</i> claim by a bankruptcy court is merely making a conditional surrender of whatever private right he has on the line, contingent on some future event\xe2\x80\x94namely, that the bankruptcy court rules against him.  Indeed, it is on this logic that the law has long encouraged and permitted private settlement of disputes, including through the action of an arbitrator not vested with the judicial power.  See <i>ante, </i>at 1 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);<i> </i>T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 399 (1868).  Perhaps for this reason, decisions discussing the relationship between private rights and the judicial power have emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>involuntary</i> divestiture\xe2\x80\x9d of a private right.  <i>Newland</i> v. <i>Marsh</i>, 19 Ill. 376, 382\xe2\x80\x93383 (1857) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But all of this does not necessarily mean that the majority has wound up in the right place by the wrong path.  Even if consent could lift the private-rights barrier to non-judicial Government action, it would not necessarily follow that consent removes the <i>Stern</i> adjudication from the core of the judicial power.  There may be other aspects of the adjudication that demand the exercise of the judicial power, such as entry of a final judgment enforceable without any further action by an Article III court.  We have recognized that judgments entered by Article III courts bear unique qualities that spring from the exercise of the judicial power, <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n\xe2\x80\x93219 (1995), and it may be that the entry of a final judgment bearing these qualities\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of the subject matter of the dispute\xe2\x80\x94is a quintessential judicial function.  See <i>ante,</i> at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  See generally <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 85\xe2\x80\x9386, and n. 38 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing the agency orders at issue in <i>Crowell </i>from bankruptcy court orders on this ground).  As Thomas Cooley explained in his influential treatise, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the judges should sit to hear .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. controversies [beyond their cognizance], they would not sit as a court; at the most they would be arbitrators only, and their .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. decision could not be binding as a judgment, but only as an award.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cooley, <i>supra,</i> at 399.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, this case implicates difficult questions about the nature of bankruptcy procedure, judicial power, and remedies.  In particular, if we were to determine that current practice accords bankruptcy court judgments a feature that demands the exercise of the judicial power, would that mean that all bankruptcy judgments resolving <i>Stern </i>claims are void, or only that courts may not give effect to that single feature that triggers Article III?  The parties have briefed none of these issues, so I do not resolve them.  But the number and magnitude of these important questions\xe2\x80\x94questions implicated by thousands of bankruptcy and magistrate judge decisions each year\xe2\x80\x94merit closer attention than the majority has given them.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even assuming we were to decide that adjudication of <i>Stern</i> claims with the consent of the parties does not require the exercise of the judicial power, that decision would not end the constitutional inquiry.  As instrumentalities of the Federal Government, the bankruptcy courts must act pursuant to some constitutional grant of author-ity.

As the Solicitor General explains, \xe2\x80\x9cIdentifying the property of the estate is therefore inescapably central to the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Identifying property that constitutes the estate has long been a central feature of bankruptcy adjudication.  English bankruptcy commissioners had authority not only to collect property in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s possession, but also to \xe2\x80\x9ccause any house or tenement of the bankrupt to be broken open,\xe2\x80\x9d in order to uncover and seize property the debtor had concealed.  2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *485.  America\xe2\x80\x99s first bankruptcy statute, enacted by Congress in 1800, similarly gave commissioners \xe2\x80\x9cpower to take into their possession, all the estate, real and personal, of every nature and description to which the [debtor] may be entitled, either in law or equity, in any manner whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa75,\n\n2Stat.\n23.  That is peculiarly a bankruptcy power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 provides further support for Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Under that Act, bankruptcy referees had authority to exercise \xe2\x80\x9csummary\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction over certain claims, while other claims could only be adjudi-cated in \xe2\x80\x9cplenary\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings before an Article III district court.  See <i>Arkison</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  This Court interpreted the 1898 Act to permit bankruptcy referees to exercise summary jurisdiction to determine whether property in the actual or constructive possession of a debtor should come within the estate, at least when no third party asserted more than a \xe2\x80\x9cmerely colorable\xe2\x80\x9d claim to the property.  <i>Mueller</i> v. <i>Nugent</i>,\n\n184 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n15 (1902)\n.  In the legal parlance of the times, a \xe2\x80\x9cmerely colorable\xe2\x80\x9d claim was one that existed \xe2\x80\x9cin appearance only, and not in reality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 223 (1891).  So a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over property in the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s possession as long as no third party asserted a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial adverse\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  <i>Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co.</i> v. <i>Fox</i>,\n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 426\n\xe2\x80\x93433 (1924).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, Sharif does not contest that he held legal title to the assets in the trust.  Assuming that no third party asserted a substantial adverse claim to those assets\xe2\x80\x94an inquiry for the Bankruptcy Court on remand\xe2\x80\x94Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s alter ego claim fits comfortably into the category of cases that bankruptcy referees could have decided by themselves under the 1898 Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Mueller</i>, for example, this Court held that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over property in the possession of a third party acting as the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s agent.  184 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 14\xe2\x80\x9317; see Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 302 (10th ed. 2014) (example of a merely \xe2\x80\x9ccolor-able\xe2\x80\x9d claim is \xe2\x80\x9cone made by a person holding property as an agent or bailee of the bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d).  Similarly, this Court held that a bankruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction over a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the debtor had concealed assets under the veil of a corporate entity that was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing but a sham and a cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sampsell</i> v. <i>Imperial Paper &amp; Color Corp.</i>,\n\n313 U.\xc2\xa0S. 215\n\xe2\x80\x93217 (1941) (internal quotation marks omitted), rev\xe2\x80\x99g 114 F.\xc2\xa02d 49, 52 (CA9 1940) (describing creditor\xe2\x80\x99s claim that corporation was debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9calter ego\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court explained in <i>Sampsell</i>, the \xe2\x80\x9clegal existence of the affiliated corporation\xe2\x80\x9d did not automatically require a plenary proceeding, because \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ere legal paraphernalia will not suffice to transform into a substantial adverse claimant a corporation whose affairs are so closely assimilated to the affairs of the dominant stockholder that in substance it is little more than his corporate pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d  313 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218.  Just as the bankruptcy referee in that case had authority to decide whether assets allegedly concealed behind the corporate veil belonged to the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy Court here had authority to decide whether the assets allegedly concealed in the trust belonged to Sharif\xe2\x80\x99sestate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sharif contends that Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s alter ego claim is more like an allegation of a fraudulent conveyance, which this Court has implied must be adjudicated by an Article III court.  See <i>Granfinanciera, S. A.</i> v. <i>Nordberg</i>,\n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33,\n56 (1989)\n; <i>Arkison</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939).  Although both actions aim to remedy a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s deception, they differ in a critical respect.  A fraudulent conveyance claim seeks assets in the hands of a third party, while an alter ego claim targets only the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond self.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 76 (2d ed. 1954).  That distinction is significant given bankruptcy\xe2\x80\x99s historic domain over property within the actual or constructive \xe2\x80\x9cpossession [of] the bankrupt at the time of the filing of the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Magnolia Petroleum Co.</i>,\n\n309 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478,\n481 (1940)\n.  Through a fraudulent conveyance, a dishonest debtor <i>relinquishes</i> possession of assets before filing for bankruptcy.  Reclaiming those assets for the estate requires depriving third parties of property within their otherwise lawful possession and control, an action that \xe2\x80\x9cquintessentially\xe2\x80\x9d required a suit at common law.  <i>Granfinanciera</i>, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56.  By contrast, a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s possession of property provided \xe2\x80\x9can adequate basis\xe2\x80\x9d for a bankruptcy referee to adjudicate a dispute over title in a summary proceeding.  <i>Thompson</i>, 309 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 482; see <i>Mueller</i>, 184 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (distinguishing claim to property in possession of debtor\xe2\x80\x99s agent from fraudulent conveyance claim in determining that bankruptcy referee could exercise summary jurisdiction).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, unlike the fraudulent conveyance claim in <i>Granfinanciera</i>, Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s alter ego claim alleges that assets within Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s actual or constructive possession belong to his estate.  And unlike the breach of contract and tort claims at issue in <i>Northern Pipeline</i> and <i>Stern</i>, Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim stems not from any independent source of law but \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the bankruptcy itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stern</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 34).  Provided that no third party asserted a substantial adverse claim to the trust assets, Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim therefore falls within the narrow historical exception that permits a non-Article III adjudicator in certain bankruptcy proceedings.  I would reverse the contrary holding by the Court of Appeals and end our inquiry there, rather than deciding a broader question that may not be necessary to the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court \xe2\x80\x9cexpresses no view\xe2\x80\x9d on whether Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim was a <i>Stern</i> claim.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa07.  Instead, the Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court had constitutional authority to enter final judgment on Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim either way.  The majority rests its decision on Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s purported consent to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication.  But Sharif has no authority to compromise the structural separation of powers or agree to an exercise of judicial power outside Article III.  His consent therefore cannot cure a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f there is a principle in our Constitution .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. more sacred than another,\xe2\x80\x9d James Madison said on the floor of the First Congress, \xe2\x80\x9cit is that which separates the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong. 581 (1789).

Just as a branch of Government may not consent away the individual liberty interest protected by the separation of powers, so too an individual may not consent away the institutional interest protected by the separation of powers.  To be sure, a private litigant may consensually relinquish <i>individual</i> constitutional rights.  A federal criminal defendant, for example, may knowingly and voluntarily waive his\n \nSixth Amendment right to a jury trial by pleading guilty to a charged offense.  See <i>Brady</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n397 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742,\n748 (1970)\n.  But that same defendant may not agree to stand trial on federal charges before a state court, a foreign court, or a moot court, because those courts have no constitutional author-ity to exercise judicial power over his case, and he has no power to confer it.

There the Court held that Article III confers both a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal right\xe2\x80\x9d that can be waived through consent and a structural component that \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards the role of the Judicial Branch in our tripartite system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 848, 850.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that this structural principle is implicated in a given case, the parties cannot by consent cure the constitutional difficulty for the same reason that the parties by consent cannot confer on federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction beyond the limitations imposed by Article III.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 850\xe2\x80\x93851.  Thus, when \xe2\x80\x9cArticle III limitations are at issue, notions of consent and waiver cannot be dispositive because the limitations serve institutional interests that the parties cannot be expected to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 851.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Schor</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a private litigant can consent to an Article III violation that affects only his \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal right\xe2\x80\x9d has been vigorously contested.  See <i>id.</i>, at 867 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the individual and structural interests served by Article III are coextensive, I do not believe that a litigant may ever waive his right to an Article III tribunal where one is constitutionally required\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Granfinanciera</i>, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But whatever the merits of that position, nobody disputes that <i>Schor</i> forbids a litigant from consenting to a constitutional violation when the structural component of Article III \xe2\x80\x9cis implicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 850\xe2\x80\x93851.  Thus, the key inquiry in this case\xe2\x80\x94as the majority puts it\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether allowing bankruptcy courts to decide <i>Stern</i> claims by consent would \xe2\x80\x98impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12 (quoting <i>Schor</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 851; alteration omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One need not search far to find the answer.  In <i>Stern</i>, this Court applied the analysis from <i>Schor</i> to bankruptcy courts and concluded that they lack Article III authority to enter final judgments on matters now known as <i>Stern</i> claims.  The Court noted that bankruptcy courts, unlike the administrative agency in <i>Schor</i>, were endowed by Congress with \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive jurisdiction reaching any area of the <i>corpus juris</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d power to render final judgments enforceable without any action by Article III courts, and authority to adjudicate counterclaims entirely independent of the bankruptcy itself.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 25\xe2\x80\x9329).  The Court concluded that allowing Congress to bestow such authority on non-Article III courts would \xe2\x80\x9ccompromise the integrity of the system of separated powers and the role of the Judiciary in that system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 38).  If there was any room for doubt about the basis for its holding, the Court dispelled it by asking a question: \xe2\x80\x9cIs there really a threat to the separation of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial power outside Article III only over certain counterclaims in bankruptcy?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 37).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe short but emphatic answer is yes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>In other words, allowing bankruptcy courts to decide <i>Stern</i> claims by consent would \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  It is little wonder that the Court of Appeals felt itself bound by <i>Stern</i> and <i>Schor</i> to hold that Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s consent could not cure the <i>Stern</i> violation.  727 F.\xc2\xa03d 751, 771 (CA7 2013).  Other Courts of Appeals have adopted the same reading.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re BP RE, L.

As the majority sees it, <i>Stern</i> \xe2\x80\x9cturned on the fact that the litigant \xe2\x80\x98did not truly consent to\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d against him in the Bankruptcy Court.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 15 (quoting 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 27)).  That is not a proper reading of the decision.  The constitutional analysis in <i>Stern</i>, spanning 22 pages, contained exactly one affirmative reference to the lack of consent.  See <i>ibid.  </i>That reference came amid a long list of factors distinguishing the proceeding in <i>Stern</i> from the proceedings in <i>Schor</i> and other \xe2\x80\x9cpublic rights\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 27\xe2\x80\x9329).  <i>Stern</i>\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent sentences made clear that the notions of consent relied upon by the Court in <i>Schor</i> did not apply in bankruptcy because \xe2\x80\x9ccreditors lack an alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 28) (quoting <i>Granfinanciera</i>, 492 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 59, n.\xc2\xa014).  Put simply, the litigant in <i>Stern</i> did not consent because he <i>could not</i> consent given the nature of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There was an opinion in <i>Stern</i> that turned heavily on consent: the dissent.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (opinion of Breyer, J.) (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9314).  The <i>Stern</i> majority responded to the dissent with a counterfactual: <i>Even if</i> consent were relevant to the analysis, that factor would not change the result because the litigant did not truly consent.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 28\xe2\x80\x9329).  Moreover, <i>Stern</i> held that \xe2\x80\x9cit does not matter who\xe2\x80\x9d authorizes a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on <i>Stern</i> claims, because the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional bar remains.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 36).  That holding is incompatible with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion today that two litigants can authorize a bankruptcy judge to render final judgments on <i>Stern</i> claims, despite the constitutional bar that remains.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also relies heavily on the supervision and control that Article III courts exercise over bankruptcy courts.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9315.<i> </i>As the majority notes, court of appeals judges appoint bankruptcy judges, and bankruptcy judges receive cases only on referral from district courts (although every district court in the country has adopted a standing rule automatically referring all bankruptcy filings to bankruptcy judges, see 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb63.02[1], p.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9326 (16th ed. 2014)).  The problem is that Congress has also given bankruptcy courts authority to enter final judgments subject only to deferential appellate review, and Article III precludes those judgments when they involve <i>Stern</i> claims.  The fact that Article III judges played a role in the Article III violation does not remedy the constitutional harm.  We have already explained why.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is a fundamental principle that no branch of government can delegate its constitutional functions to an actor who lacks authority to exercise those functions.  See <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n472 (2001)\n; <i>Carter</i> v. <i>Carter Coal Co.</i>,\n\n298 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238,\n311 (1936)\n.  Such delegations threaten liberty and thwart accountability by empowering entities that lack the structural protections the Framers carefully devised.  See <i>Department of Transportation</i> v. <i>Association of American Railroads</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937); <i>id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933); <i>Mistretta</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n488 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361\n\xe2\x80\x93422 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Article III judges have no constitutional authority to delegate the judicial power\xe2\x80\x94the power to \xe2\x80\x9crender dispositive judgments\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to non-Article III judges, no matter how closely they control or supervise theirwork.  <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 219 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s arguments about supervision and control are not new.

See 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 36) (\xe2\x80\x9cit does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy judge or authorized the judge to render final judgments\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, 458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 84\xe2\x80\x9386 (plurality opinion); <i>id.</i>, at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).  The majority points to no differences between the bankruptcy proceeding in <i>Stern</i> and the bankruptcy proceeding here, except for Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s purported consent.  The majority thus treats consent as \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive\xe2\x80\x9d in curing the structural separation of powers violation\xe2\x80\x94precisely what <i>Schor</i> said consent could not do.  478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 851.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Eager to change the subject from <i>Stern</i>, the majority devotes considerable attention to defending the authority of magistrate judges, who may conduct certain proceedings with the consent of the parties under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7636.  No one here challenges the constitutionality of magistrate judges or disputes that they, like bankruptcy judges, may issue reports and recommendations that are reviewed <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> by Article III judges.  The cases about magistrate judges cited by the majority therefore have little bearing on this case, because none of them involved a constitutional challenge to the entry of final judgment by a non-Article III actor.  See <i>Roell</i> v. <i>Withrow</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 580 (2003)\n (statutory challenge only); <i>Peretz</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 923 (1991)\n (challenge to a magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of <i>voir\xc2\xa0dire</i> in a felony trial); <i>Gomez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 858 (1989)\n (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also points to 19th-century cases in which courts referred disputes to non-Article III referees, masters, or arbitrators.  <i>Ante</i>, at<i> </i>8.  In those cases, however, it was the Article III court that ultimately entered final judgment.  <i>E.g., Thornton</i> v. <i>Carson</i>, 7 Cranch 596, 600 (1813) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Court was right in entering the judgment for the sums awarded\xe2\x80\x9d).  Article III courts do refer matters to non-Article III actors for assistance from time to time.  This Court does so regularly in original jurisdiction cases.  See, <i>e.g., Kansas</i> v. <i>Nebraska</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 1).  But under the Constitution, the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate responsibility for deciding\xe2\x80\x9d the case must remain with the Article III court.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>New Mexico</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,\n317 (1984)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s comparison of bankruptcy judges to arbitrators is similarly inapt.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1 (opinion of Alito, J.).  Arbitration is \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of contract\xe2\x80\x9d by which parties agree to resolve their disputes in a private forum.  <i>Rent-A-Center, West, Inc.</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 63,\n67 (2010)\n.  Such an arrangement does not implicate Article III any more than does an agreement between two business partners to submit a difference of opinion to a mutually trusted friend.  Arbitration agreements, like most private contracts, can be enforced in court.  And Congress, pursuant to its Commerce Clause power, has authorized district courts to enter judgments enforcing arbitration awards under certain circumstances.  See\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79.  But this ordinary scheme of contract enforcement creates no constitutional concern.  As the concurrence acknowledges, only Article III judges\xe2\x80\x94not arbitrators\xe2\x80\x94may enter final judgments enforcing arbitration awards.  <i>Ante</i>, at 1.<i> </i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The discussion of magistrate judges, masters, arbitrators, and the like fits with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the supposedly dire consequences that would follow a decision that parties cannot consent to the final adjudication of <i>Stern</i> claims in bankruptcy courts.  Of course, it \xe2\x80\x9cgoes without saying\xe2\x80\x9d that practical considerations of efficiency and convenience cannot trump the structural protections of the Constitution.  <i>Stern</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 36); see <i>Perez</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 20) (\xe2\x80\x9cEven in the face of perceived necessity, the Constitution protects us from ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d).  And I find it hard to believe that the Framers in Philadelphia, who took great care to ensure that the Judiciary was \xe2\x80\x9ctruly distinct\xe2\x80\x9d from the Legislature, would have been comforted to know that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s incursion here could \xe2\x80\x9conly be termed <i>de minimis</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13 (quoting <i>Schor</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 856).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the majority overstates the consequences of enforcing the requirements of Article III in this case.  As explained in Part I, Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim may not be a <i>Stern</i> claim, in which case the bankruptcy statute would apply precisely as Congress wrote it.  Even if Wellness\xe2\x80\x99s claim were a <i>Stern</i> claim, the District Court would not need to start from scratch.  As this Court held in <i>Arkison</i>, the District Court could treat the bankruptcy judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision as a recommendation and enter judgment after performing <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> review.  573 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Stern</i>, the Court cautioned that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmay no more lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial Branch than it may eliminate it entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 37).  The majority sees no reason to fret, however, so long as two private parties consent. <i> Ante,</i> at 14, n.\xc2\xa010.  But such parties are unlikely to carefully weigh the long-term structural independence of the Article III judiciary against their own short-term priorities.  Perhaps the majority\xe2\x80\x99s acquiescence in this diminution of constitutional authority will escape notice.  Far more likely, however, it will amount to the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cblueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power\xe2\x80\x9d that we have resisted in the past.  <i>PCAOB</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 500 (quoting <i>Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority</i> v. <i>Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc.</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252,\n277 (1991)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The encroachment at issue here may seem benign enough.  Bankruptcy judges are devoted professionals who strive to be fair to all sides, and litigants can be trusted to protect their own interests when deciding whether to consent.  But the fact remains that Congress controls the salary and tenure of bankruptcy judges, and the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s present solicitude provides no guarantee of its future restraint.  See <i>Glidden Co.</i> v. <i>Zdanok</i>,\n\n370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530,\n534 (1962)\n (plurality opinion).  Once Congress knows that it can assign federal claims to judges outside Article III with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 consent, nothing would limit its exercise of that power to bankruptcy.  Congress may consider it advantageous to allow claims to be heard before judges subject to greater legislative control in any number of areas of federal concern.  As for the requirement of consent, Congress can find ways to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage\xe2\x80\x9d consent, say by requiring it as a condition of federal benefits.  That has worked to expand Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power before.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>College Savings Bank</i> v. <i>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 666,\n686 (1999)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>South Dakota</i> v. <i>Dole</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203,\n207 (1987)\n (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Legislative designs of this kind would not displace the Article III judiciary overnight.  But steady erosion of Article III authority, no less than a brazen usurpation, violates the constitutional separation of powers.  In a Federal Government of limited powers, one branch\xe2\x80\x99s loss is another branch\xe2\x80\x99s gain, see <i>PCAOB</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 500, so whether a branch aims to \xe2\x80\x9carrogate power to itself\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cimpair another in the performance of its constitutional duties,\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution forbids the transgression all the same.  <i>Loving</i>, 517 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 757.  As we have cautioned, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]light encroachments create new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stern</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 38) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Framers understood this danger.  They warned that the Legislature would inevitably seek to draw greater power into its \xe2\x80\x9cimpetuous vortex,\xe2\x80\x9d The Federalist No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison), and that \xe2\x80\x9cpower over a man\xe2\x80\x99s subsistence amounts to a power over his will,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, No. 79, at 472 (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted).  In response, the Framers adopted the structural protections of Article III, \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing high walls and clear distinctions because low walls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 239.  As this Court once put it, invoking Frost, \xe2\x80\x9cGood fences make good neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 240.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Ultimately, however, the structural protections of Article III are only as strong as this Court\xe2\x80\x99s will to enforce them.  In Madison\xe2\x80\x99s words, the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 51, at 321\xe2\x80\x93322 (J. Madison).  The Court today declines to resist encroachment by the Legislature.  Instead it holds that a single federal judge, for reasons adequate to him, may assign away our hard-won constitutional birthright so long as two private parties agree.  I hope I will be wrong about the consequences of this decision for the independence of the Judicial Branch.  But for now, another literary passage comes to mind: It profits the Court nothing to give its soul for the whole world . . . but to avoid <i>Stern</i> claims?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</i></div><i>\n</i></div><i>\n</i>\n</b></div>'
