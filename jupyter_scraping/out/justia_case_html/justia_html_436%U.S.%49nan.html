JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>This case requires us to decide whether a federal court may pass on the validity of an Indian tribe\'s ordinance denying membership to the children of certain female tribal members.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Santa Clara Pueblo is an Indian tribe that has been in existence for over 600 years.  Respondents, a female member of the tribe and her daughter, brought suit in federal court against the tribe and its Governor, petitioner Lucario Padilla, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of a tribal ordinance denying membership in the tribe to children of female members who marry outside the tribe, while extending membership to children of male members who marry outside the tribe.  Respondents claimed that this rule discriminates on the basis of both sex and ancestry in violation of Title I of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA), 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301-1303, which provides in relevant part that "[n]o Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws."  \xc2\xa7 1302(8). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Title I of the ICRA does not expressly authorize the bringing of civil actions for declaratory or injunctive relief to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="52">Page 436 U. S. 52</a></p><p> enforce its substantive provisions.  The threshold issue in this case is thus whether the Act may be interpreted to impliedly authorize such actions, against a tribe or its officers, in the federal courts.  For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Act cannot be so read.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Julia Martinez is a full-blooded member of the Santa Clara Pueblo, and resides on the Santa Clara Reservation in Northern New Mexico.  In 1941, she married a Navajo Indian with whom she has since had several children, including respondent Audrey Martinez.  Two years before this marriage, the Pueblo passed the membership ordinance here at issue, which bars admission of the Martinez children to the tribe because their father is not a Santa Claran. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Although the children were raised on the reservation and continue to reside there now that they are adults, as a result of their exclusion from membership, they may not vote in tribal elections or hold secular office in the tribe; moreover, they have no right to remain on the reservation in the event of their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 436 U. S. 53</a></p><p> mother\'s death; or to inherit their mother\'s home or her possessory interests in the communal lands.</p>\n<p>After unsuccessful efforts to persuade the tribe to change the membership rule, respondents filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide intra-tribal controversies affecting matters of tribal self-government and sovereignty.  The District Court rejected petitioners\' contention, finding that jurisdiction was conferred by 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(4) and 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1302(8).  The court apparently concluded, first, that the substantive provisions of Title I impliedly authorized civil actions for declaratory and injunctive relief, and second, that the tribe was not immune from such suit. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Accordingly, the motion to dismiss was denied.  402 F.Supp. 5 (1975).</p>\n<p>Following a full trial, the District Court found for petitioners on the merits.  While acknowledging the relatively recent origin of the disputed rule, the District Court nevertheless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 436 U. S. 54</a></p><p> found it to reflect traditional values of patriarchy still significant in tribal life.  The court recognized the vital importance of respondents\' interests, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] but also determined that membership rules were "no more or less than a mechanism of social . . . self-definition," and, as such, were basic to the tribe\'s survival as a cultural and economic entity.  <em>Id.</em> at 15. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In sustaining the ordinance\'s validity under the "equal protection clause" of the ICRA, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1302(8), the District Court concluded that the balance to be struck between these competing interests was better left to the judgment of the Pueblo:</p>\n<p>"[T]he equal protection guarantee of the Indian Civil Rights Act should not be construed in a manner which would require or authorize this Court to determine which traditional values will promote cultural survival and should therefore be preserved. . . .  Such a determination should be made by the people of Santa Clara, not only because they can best decide what values are important, but also because they must live with the decision every day. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  To abrogate tribal decisions, particularly in the delicate area of membership, for whatever \'good\' reasons, is to destroy cultural identity under the guise of saving it."</p>\n<p>402 F.Supp. at 119.</p>\n<p>On respondents\' appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld the District Court\'s determination that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(4) provides a jurisdictional basis for actions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 436 U. S. 55</a></p><p> under Title I of the ICRA.  540 F.2d 1039, 1042 (1976).  It found that,</p>\n<p>"since [the ICRA] was designed to provide protection against tribal authority, the intention of Congress to allow suits against the tribe was an essential aspect [of the ICRA].  Otherwise, it would constitute a mere unenforceable declaration of principles."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  The Court of Appeals disagreed, however, with the District Court\'s ruling on the merits.  While recognizing that standards of analysis developed under the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Equal Protection Clause were not necessarily controlling in the interpretation of this statute, the Court of Appeals apparently concluded that, because the classification was one based upon sex, it was presumptively invidious, and could be sustained only if justified by a compelling tribal interest.  <em>See id.</em> at 1047-1048.  Because of the ordinance\'s recent vintage, and because in the court\'s view the rule did not rationally identify those persons who were emotionally and culturally Santa Clarans, the court held that the tribe\'s interest in the ordinance was not substantial enough to justify its discriminatory effect.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 431 U.S. 913 (1977), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Indian tribes are "distinct, independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights" in matters of local self-government.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v.

Title I of the ICRA, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 \xc2\xa7 1301-1303, represents an exercise of that authority.  In 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1302, Congress acted to modify the effect of <em>Talton</em> and its progeny by imposing certain restrictions upon tribal governments similar, but not identical, to those contained in the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment.

They argue, further, that Congress did not waive he tribe\'s sovereign immunity from suit.  Respondents, on the other hand, contend that \xc2\xa7 1302 not only modifies the substantive law applicable to the exercise of sovereign tribal powers, but also authorizes civil suits for equitable relief against the tribe and its officers in federal courts.

Moreover, since the respondent in a habeas corpus action is the individual custodian of the prisoner, <em>see, e.g.,</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2243, the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1303 can hardly be read as a general waiver of the tribe\'s sovereign immunity.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  This commitment to the goal of tribal self-determination is demonstrated by the provisions of Title I itself.  Section 1302, rather than providing in wholesale fashion for the extension of constitutional requirements to tribal governments, as had been initially proposed, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] selectively incorporated and in some instances modified the safeguards of the Bill of Rights to fit the unique political, cultural, and economic needs of tribal governments.

[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The other Titles of the ICRA also manifest a congressional purpose to protect tribal sovereignty from undue interference.  For instance, Title III, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1321-1326, hailed by some of the ICRA\'s supporters as the most important part of the Act, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] provides that States may not assume civil or criminal jurisdiction over "Indian country" without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 436 U. S. 64</a></p><p> the prior consent of the tribe, thereby abrogating prior law to the contrary. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Other Titles of the ICRA provide for strengthening certain tribal courts through training of Indian judges, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and for minimizing interference by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs in tribal litigation. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Where Congress seeks to promote dual objectives in a single statute, courts must be more than usually hesitant to infer from its silence a cause of action that, while serving one legislative purpose, will disserve the other.  Creation of a federal cause of action for the enforcement of rights created in Title I, however useful it might be in securing compliance with \xc2\xa7 1302, plainly would be at odds with the congressional goal of protecting tribal self-government.  Not only would it undermine the authority of tribal forums, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">436 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Tribal courts have repeatedly been recognized as appropriate forums for the exclusive adjudication of disputes affecting important personal and property interests of both Indians and non-Indians.

[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to disturb the balance between the dual statutory objectives which Congress apparently struck in providing only for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Our reluctance is strongly reinforced by the specific legislative history underlying 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1303.  This history, extending over more than three years, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] indicates that Congress\' provision for habeas corpus relief, and nothing more, reflected a considered accommodation of the competing goals of</p>\n<p>"preventing injustices perpetrated by tribal governments, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 436 U. S. 67</a></p><p> on the one hand, and, on the other, avoiding undue or precipitous interference in the affairs of the Indian people."</p>\n<p>Summary Report 11.</p>\n<p>In settling on habeas corpus as the exclusive means for federal court review of tribal criminal proceedings, Congress opted for a less intrusive review mechanism than had been initially proposed.  Originally, the legislation would have authorized <em>de novo</em> review in federal court of all convictions obtained in tribal courts. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  At hearings held on the proposed legislation in 1965, however, it became clear that even those in agreement with the general thrust of the review provision -- to provide some form of judicial review of criminal proceedings in tribal courts -- believed that <em>de novo</em> review would impose unmanageable financial burdens on tribal governments and needlessly displace tribal courts.  <em>See id.</em> at 12; 1965 Hearings 22-23, 157, 162, 341-342.  Moreover, tribal representatives argued that <em>de novo</em> review would "deprive the tribal court of all jurisdiction in the event of an appeal, thus having a harmful effect upon law enforcement within the reservation," and urged instead that "decisions of tribal courts . . . be reviewed in the U.S. district courts upon petition for a writ of habeas corpus."  <em>Id.</em> at 79.  After considering numerous alternatives for review of tribal convictions, Congress apparently decided that review by way of habeas corpus would adequately protect the individual interests at stake while avoiding unnecessary intrusions on tribal governments.</p>\n<p>Similarly, and of more direct import to the issue in this case, Congress considered and rejected proposals for federal review of alleged violations of the Act arising in a civil context.  As initially introduced, the Act would have required the Attorney General to "receive and investigate" complaints </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 436 U. S. 68</a></p><p> relating to deprivations of an Indian\'s statutory or constitutional rights, and to bring "such criminal or other action as he deems appropriate to vindicate and secure such right to such Indian." [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  Notwithstanding the screening effect this proposal would have had on frivolous or vexatious lawsuits, it was bitterly opposed by several tribes.  The Crow Tribe representative stated:</p>\n<p>"This [bill] would in effect subject the tribal sovereignty of self-government to the Federal government. . . .  [B]y its broad terms, [it] would allow the Attorney General to bring any kind of action as he deems appropriate.  By this bill, any time a member of the tribe would not be satisfied with an action by the [tribal] council, it would allow them [<em>sic</em>] to file a complaint with the Attorney General and subject the tribe to a multitude of investigations and threat of court action."</p>\n<p>1965 Hearings 235 (statement of Mr. Real Bird).  In a similar vein, the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council argued that,</p>\n<p>"[i]f the perpetually dissatisfied individual Indian were to be armed with legislation such as proposed in [this bill], he could disrupt the whole of a tribal government."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 343.  In response, this provision for suit by the Attorney General was completely eliminated from the ICRA.  At the same time, Congress rejected a substitute proposed by the Interior Department that would have authorized the Department to adjudicate civil complaints concerning tribal actions, with review in the district courts available from final decisions of the agency. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="69">Page 436 U. S. 69</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Given this history, it is highly unlikely that Congress would have intended a private cause of action for injunctive and declaratory relief to be available in the federal courts to secure enforcement of 1302.  Although the only Committee Report on the ICRA in its final form, S.Rep. No. 841, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), sheds little additional light on this question, it would hardly support a contrary conclusion. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Indeed, its description of the purpose of Title I, [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] as well as the floor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 436 U. S. 70</a></p><p> debates on the bill, [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] indicates that the ICRA was generally understood to authorize federal judicial review of tribal actions only through the habeas corpus provisions of\xc2\xa7 1303. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  These factors, together with Congress\' rejection of proposals that clearly would have authorized causes of action other than habeas corpus, persuade us that Congress, aware of the intrusive effect of federal judicial review upon tribal self-government, intended to create only a limited mechanism for such review, namely, that provided for expressly in \xc2\xa7 1303. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="71">Page 436 U. S. 71</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>As the bill\'s chief sponsor, Senator Ervin, [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] commented in urging its passage, the ICRA "should not be considered as the final solution to the many serious constitutional problems confronting the American Indian."  113 Cong.Rec. 13473 (1967).  Although Congress explored the extent to which tribes were adhering to constitutional norms in both civil and criminal contexts, its legislative investigation revealed that the most serious abuses of tribal power had occurred in the administration of criminal justice.  <em>See ibid.,</em> quoting Summary Report 24.  In light of this finding, and given Congress\' desire not to intrude needlessly on tribal self-government, it is not surprising that Congress chose at this stage to provide for federal review only in habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p>By not exposing tribal officials to the full array of federal remedies available to redress actions of federal and state officials, Congress may also have considered that resolution of statutory issues under \xc2\xa7 1302, and particularly those issues likely to arise in a civil context, will frequently depend on questions of tribal tradition and custom which tribal forums may be in a better position to evaluate than federal courts.  Our relations with the Indian tribes have "always been . . . anomalous . . . and of a complex character."  <em>United States v. Kagama,</em> 118 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/375/case.html#381">118 U. S. 381</a></span>.  Although we early rejected the notion that Indian tribes are "foreign states" for jurisdictional purposes under Art. III, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/1/case.html">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 5 Pet. 1 (1831), we have also recognized that the tribes remain quasi-sovereign nations which, by government structure, culture, and source of sovereignty, are in many ways foreign to the constitutional institutions of the Federal and State Governments.  <em>See Elk v. Wilkins,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/94/case.html">112 U. S. 94</a></span> (1884).

S. 72</a></p><p> efforts by he federal judiciary to apply the statutory prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 1302 in a civil context may substantially interfere with a tribe\'s ability to maintain itself as a culturally and politically distinct entity. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>As we have repeatedly emphasized, Congress\' authority over Indian matters is extraordinarily broad, and the role of courts in adjusting relations between and among tribes and their members correspondingly restrained.  <em>See Lone Wolf v.

Congress retains authority expressly to authorize civil actions for injunctive or other relief to redress violations of \xc2\xa7 1302, in the event that the tribes themselves prove deficient in applying and enforcing its substantive provisions.  But unless and until Congress makes clear its intention to permit the additional intrusion on tribal sovereignty that adjudication of such actions in a federal forum would represent, we are constrained to find that \xc2\xa7 1302 does not impliedly authorize actions for declaratory or injunctive relief against either the tribe or its officers.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, accordingly,</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

Although there is some language suggesting that Congress was concerned about the unavailability of relief in federal court, the Report nowhere states that Title I would be enforceable in a cause of action for declaratory or injunctive relief, and the cited passage is fully consistent with the conclusion that Congress intended only to modify the substance of the law applicable to Indian tribes, and to allow enforcement in federal court through habeas corpus.  The Report itself characterized the import of its discussion as follows:</p>\n<p>"These cases illustrate the continued denial of specific constitutional guarantees to litigants in tribal court proceedings, on the ground that the tribal courts are quasi-sovereign entities to which general provisions in the Constitution do not apply."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 10.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The Report states:</p>\n<p>"The purpose of title I is to protect individual Indians from arbitrary and unjust actions by tribal governments.

It explains further that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is hoped that title II [25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1311], requiring the Secretary of the Interior to recommend a model code [to govern the administration of justice] for all Indian tribes, will implement the effect of title I."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  (Although \xc2\xa7 1311 by its terms refers only to courts of Indian offenses, <em>see</em> <a href="#F17" name="T17">n</a> 17, <em>supra,</em> the Senate Report makes clear that the code is intended to serve as a model for use in all tribal courts.

We have previously identified the factors that are relevant in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one:  whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted; whether there is any indication of legislative intent either to create a remedy or to deny one; whether such a remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the statute; and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law.  <em>Cort v. Ash,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html">422 U. S. 66</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#78">422 U. S. 78</a></span> (1975).  Application of these factors in the present context indicates that a private cause of action under Title I of the ICRA should be inferred.</p>\n<p>As the majority readily concedes, "respondents, American Indians living on the Santa Clara reservation, are among the class for whose especial benefit this legislation was enacted."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#61">436 U. S. 61</a></span>.  In spite of this recognition of the congressional intent to provide these particular respondents with the guarantee of equal protection of the laws, the Court denies them access to the federal courts to enforce this right because it concludes that Congress intended habeas corpus to be the exclusive remedy under Title I.  My reading of the statute and the legislative history convinces me that Congress did not intend to deny a private cause of action to enforce the rights granted under \xc2\xa7 1302.</p>\n<p>The ICRA itself gives no indication that the constitutional rights it extends to American Indians are to be enforced only by means of federal habeas corpus actions.  On the contrary, since several of the specified rights are most frequently invoked in noncustodial situations, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] the natural assumption is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 436 U. S. 75</a></p><p> that some remedy other than habeas corpus must be contemplated.  This assumption is not dispelled by the fact that the Congress chose to enumerate specifically the rights granted under \xc2\xa7 1302, rather than to state broadly, as was originally proposed, that</p>\n<p>"any Indian tribe in exercising its powers of local self-government shall be subject to the same limitations and restraints as those which are imposed on the Government of the United States by the United States Constitution."</p>\n<p>S. 961, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).  The legislative history reflects that the decision "to indicate in more specific terms the constitutional protections the American Indian possesses in relation to his tribe." was made in recognition of the "peculiarities of the Indian\'s economic and social condition, his customs, his beliefs, and his attitudes. . . ."  Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Constitutional Rights of the American Indian:  Summary Report of Hearings and Investigations pursuant to S.Res.194, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 25, 9 (Comm.Print 1966) (hereinafter Summary Report).  While I believe that the uniqueness of the Indian culture must be taken into consideration in applying the constitutional rights granted in \xc2\xa7 1302, I do not think that it requires insulation of official tribal actions from federal court scrutiny.  Nor do I find any indication that Congress so intended.</p>\n<p>The inferences that the majority draws from various changes Congress made in the originally proposed legislation are, to my mind, unsupported by the legislative history.  The first change the Court points to is the substitution of a habeas corpus provision for S. 962\'s provision of <em>de novo</em> federal court review of tribal criminal proceedings.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#67">436 U. S. 67</a></span>.  This change, restricted in its concern to the criminal context, is of limited relevance to the question whether Congress intended a private cause of action to enforce rights arising in a civil context.  Moreover, the reasons this change was made are not inconsistent with the recognition of such a cause of action.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 436 U. S. 76</a></p><p> The Summary Report explains that the change in S. 962 was made only because of displeasure with the degree of intrusion permitted by the original provision:</p>\n<p>"No one appearing before the subcommittee or submitting testimony for the subcommittee\'s consideration opposed the provision of some type of appeal from the decisions of tribal courts.  Criticism of S. 962, however, was directed at the bill\'s use of a trial <em>de novo</em> in a U.S. district court as the appropriate means of securing appellate review. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"There was considerable support for the suggestion that the district court, instead of reviewing tribal court decisions on a <em>de novo</em> basis, be authorized only to decide whether the accused was deprived of a constitutional right.  If no deprivation were found, the tribal court decision would stand.  If, on the other hand, the district court determined that an accused had suffered a denial of his rights at the hands of the tribal court, the case would be remanded with instructions for dismissal or retrial, as the district court might decide."</p>\n<p>Summary Report 12-13 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The degree of intrusion permitted by a private cause of action to enforce the civil provisions of \xc2\xa7 1302 would be no greater than that permitted in a habeas corpus proceeding.  The federal district court\'s duty would be limited to determining whether the challenged tribal action violated one of the enumerated rights.  If found to be in violation, the action would be invalidated; if not, it would be allowed to stand.  In no event would the court be authorized, as in a <em>de novo</em> review proceeding, to substitute its judgment concerning the wisdom of the action taken for that of the tribal authorities.</p>\n<p>Nor am I persuaded that Congress, by rejecting various proposals for administrative review of alleged violations of Indian </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 436 U. S. 77</a></p><p> rights, indicated its rejection of federal judicial review of such violations.  As the majority notes, the original version of the Act provided for investigation by the Attorney General of</p>\n<p>"any written complaint filed with him by any Indian . . . alleging that such Indian has been deprived of a right conferred upon citizens of the United States by the laws and Constitution of the United States."</p>\n<p>S. 963, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).  The bill would have authorized the Attorney General to bring whatever action he deemed appropriate to vindicate such right.  Although it is true that this provision was eliminated from the final version of the ICRA, the inference the majority seeks to draw from this fact is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>It should first be noted that the focus of S. 963 was, in large part, aimed at nontribal deprivations of Indian rights.  In explaining the need for the bill, the Subcommittee stated that it had received complaints of deprivations of Indians\' constitutional rights in the following contexts, only two of which concern tribal actions:</p>\n<p>"[I]llegal detention of reservation Indians by State and tribal officials; arbitrary decisionmaking by the Bureau of Indian Affairs; denial of various State welfare services to Indians living off the reservations; discrimination by government officials in health services; mistreatment and brutality against Indians by State and tribal law enforcement officers; and job discrimination by Federal and State agencies and private businesses."</p>\n<p>Hearings on S. 961-968 and S.J.Res 40 before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1965) (hereinafter 1965 Hearings).  <em>See also id.</em> at 86 (testimony of Arthur Lazarus, Jr., General Counsel for the Association on American Indian Affairs, Inc.:  "It is my understanding . . . that the complaints to be filed with the Attorney General are generally to be off-reservation violations of rights along the lines of the provisions in the Civil Rights Act").  Given this difference in focus, the elimination of this proposal has little relevance to the issue before us. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="78">Page 436 U. S. 78</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, the reasons for the proposal\'s deletion are not as clear as the majority seems to indicate.  While two witnesses did express their fears that the proposal would disrupt tribal governments, many others expressed the view that the proposals gave the Attorney General no more authority than he already possessed.  <em>Id.</em> at 92, 104, 227, 319.  The Acting Secretary of the Interior was among those who thought that this additional authorization was not needed by the Attorney General because the Department of the Interior already routinely referred complaints of Indian rights violations to him for the commencement of appropriate litigation.  <em>Id.</em> at 319.  The failure of Congress to adopt the Department of the Interior\'s substitute provision provides even less support for the view that Congress opposed a private cause of action.  This proposal would have allowed the Secretary of the Interior to review</p>\n<p>"[a]ny action, other than a criminal action, taken by an Indian tribal government which deprives any American Indian of a right or freedom established and protected by this Act . . ."</p>\n<p>and to take "such corrective action" as he deemed necessary.  <em>Id.</em> at 318.  It was proposed in tandem with a provision that would have allowed an Indian to appeal from a criminal conviction in a tribal court to the Secretary, who would then have been authorized to affirm, modify, or reverse the tribal court\'s decision.  Most of the discussion about this joint proposal focused on the review of criminal proceedings, and several witnesses expressed objection to it because it improperly "mixed" "the judicial process . . . with the executive process."  <em>Id.</em> at 96.  <em>See also id.</em> at 294.  Senator Ervin himself stated that he had</p>\n<p>"difficulty reconciling [his] ideas of the nature of the judicial process and the notion of taking an appeal in what is supposed to be a judicial proceeding to the executive branch of the Government."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 225.  While the discussion of the civil part of the proposal was limited, it may be assumed that Congress was equally unreceptive to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 436 U. S. 79</a></p><p> idea of the Executive Branch\'s taking "corrective actions" with regard to noncriminal actions of tribal governments.</p>\n<p>In sum, then, I find no positive indication in the legislative history that Congress opposed a private cause of action to enforce the rights extended to Indians under \xc2\xa7 1302. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The absence of any express approval of such a cause of action, of course, does not prohibit its inference, for, as we stated in <em>Cort:</em></p>\n<p>"[I]n situations in which it is clear that federal law has granted a class of persons certain rights, it is not necessary to show an intention to create a private cause of action, although an explicit purpose to deny such cause of action would be controlling."</p>\n<p>422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#82">422 U. S. 82</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The most important consideration, of course, is whether a private cause of action would be consistent with the underlying </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 436 U. S. 80</a></p><p> purposes of the Act.  As noted at the outset, the Senate Report states that the purpose of the ICRA "is to insure that the American Indian is afforded the broad constitutional rights secured to other Americans."  Senate Report 6.  Not only is a private cause of action consistent with that purpose, it is necessary for its achievement.  The legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned, not only about the Indian\'s lack of substantive rights, but also about the lack of remedies to enforce whatever rights the Indian might have.  During its consideration of this legislation, the Senate Subcommittee pointed out that,</p>\n<p>"[t]hough protected against abridgment of his rights by State or Federal action, the individual Indian is . . . without redress against his tribal authorities."</p>\n<p>Summary Report 3.  It is clear that the Subcommittee\'s concern was not limited to the criminal context, for it explained:</p>\n<p>"It is not only in the operation of tribal courts that Indians enjoy something other than full benefit of the Bill of Rights.  For example, a Navajo tribal council ordinance prohibiting the use of peyote resulted in an alleged abridgment of religious freedom when applied to members of the Native American Church, an Indian sect which uses the cactus plant in connection with its worship services."</p>\n<p>"The opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in dismissing an action of the Native American Church against the Navajo tribal council, is instructive in pointing up the lack of remedies available to the Indian in resolving his differences with tribal officials."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 3-4 (footnotes omitted). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 436 U. S. 81</a></p><p> It was "[t]o remedy these various situations, and thereby to safeguard the rights of Indian citizens . . . ," that the legislation resulting in the ICRA was proposed.  <em>Id.</em> at 5.</p>\n<p>Several witnesses appearing before the Senate Subcommittee testified concerning deprivations of their rights by tribal authorities and their inability to gain relief.  Mr. Frank Takes Gun, President of the Native American Church, for example, stated that</p>\n<p>"the Indian is without an effective means to enforce whatever constitutional rights he may have in tribal proceedings instituted to deprive him of liberty or property.  While I suppose that abstractedly [<em>sic</em>] we might be said to enjoy [certain] rights . . . , the blunt fact is that, unless the tribal court elects to confer that right upon us, we have no way of securing it."</p>\n<p>1965 Hearings 164.  Miss Emily Schuler, who accompanied a former Governor of the Isleta Pueblo to the hearings, echoed these concerns.  She complained that "[t]he people get governors and sometimes they get power hungry, and then the people have no rights at all," to which Senator Ervin responded:</p>\n<p>"\'Power hungry\' is a pretty good shorthand statement to show why the people of the United States drew up a Constitution.  They wanted to compel their rulers to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="82">Page 436 U. S. 82</a></p><p> stay within the bounds of that Constitution and not let that hunger for power carry them outside it."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 264.</p>\n<p>Given Congress\' concern about the deprivations of Indian rights by tribal authorities, I cannot believe, as does the majority, that it desired the enforcement of these rights to be left up to the very tribal authorities alleged to have violated them.  In the case of the Santa Clara Pueblo, for example, both legislative and judicial powers are vested in the same body, the Pueblo Council.  <em>See</em> App. 3-5.  To suggest that this tribal body is the "appropriate" forum for the adjudication of alleged violations of the ICRA is to ignore both reality and Congress\' desire to provide a means of redress to Indians aggrieved by their tribal leaders. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Senate Report\'s statement of the purpose of the ICRA refers only to the granting of constitutional rights to the Indians, I agree with the majority that the legislative history demonstrates that Congress was also concerned with furthering Indian self-government.  I do not agree, however, that this concern on the part of Congress precludes our recognition of a federal cause of action to enforce the terms of the Act.  The major intrusion upon the tribe\'s right to govern itself occurred when Congress enacted the ICRA and mandated that the tribe "in exercising powers of self-government" observe the rights enumerated in \xc2\xa7 1302.  The extension of constitutional rights to individual citizens is intended to intrude upon the authority of government.  And once it has been decided that an individual does possess certain rights <em>vis-a-vis</em> his government, it necessarily follows that he has some way to enforce those rights.  Although creating a federal cause of action may "constitut[e] an interference with tribal autonomy and self-government beyond that created by the change in substantive law itself," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">436 U. S. 59</span>, in my mind, it is a further step that must be taken; otherwise, the change in the law may be meaningless.</p>\n<p>The final consideration suggested in <em>Cort</em> is the appropriateness of a federal forum to vindicate the right in question.  As even the majority acknowledges, "we have frequently recognized the propriety of inferring a federal cause of action for the enforcement of civil rights. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#61">436 U. S. 61</a></span>.  For the reasons set out above, I would make no exception here.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that respondents stated a cause of action over which the federal courts have jurisdiction, I would proceed to the merits of their claim.  Accordingly, I dissent from the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301-1303.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the ICRA is silent on the question, I agree with the Court that the Act does not constitute  waiver of the Pueblo\'s sovereign immunity.  The relief respondents seek, however, is available against petitioner Lucario Padilla, the Governor of the Pueblo.  Under the Santa Clara Constitution, the Governor is charged with the duty of enforcing the Pueblo\'s laws.  App. 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, habeas corpus relief is unlikely to be available to redress violations of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free exercise of religion, or just compensation for the taking of property.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>References in the legislative history to the role of Title II\'s model code in effectuating the purposes of Title I do not indicate that Congress rejected the possibility of a federal cause of action under \xc2\xa7 1302.  The wording of \xc2\xa7 1311, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to recommend a model code, demonstrates that, in enacting Title II, Congress was primarily concerned with criminal proceedings.  Thus it requires the code to include</p>\n<p>"provisions which will (1) assure that any individual being tried for an offense by a court of Indian offenses shall have the same rights, privileges, and immunities under the United States Constitution as would be guaranteed any citizen of the United States being tried in a Federal court for any similar offense, (2) assure that any individual being tried for an offense by a court of Indian offenses will be advised and made aware of his rights under the United States Constitution, and under any tribal constitution applicable to such individual. . . ."</p>\n<p>The remaining required provisions concern the qualifications for office of judges of courts of Indian offenses and educational classes for the training of such judges.  While the enactment of Title II shows Congress\' desire to implement the provisions of \xc2\xa7 1302 concerning rights of criminal defendants and to upgrade the quality of tribal judicial proceedings, it gives no indication that Congress decided to deny a federal cause of action to review tribal actions arising in a noncriminal context.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The opinion to which the Subcommittee was referring was <em>Native American Church v. Navajo Tribal Council,</em> 272 F.2d 131 (CA10 1959), in which the court dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction an action challenging a Navajo tribal ordinance making it a criminal offense "to introduce into the Navajo country, sell, use or have in possession within the Navajo country, the bean known as peyote. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 132.  It was contended that the ordinance violated plaintiffs\' right to the free exercise of religion.  Because the court concluded that the First Amendment was not applicable to the tribe, it held that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction, "even though [the tribal laws or regulations] may have an impact to some extent on forms of religious worship."  <em>Id.</em> at 135.</p>\n<p>The Senate Report also made note of this decision in what the majority terms a "rambling passage."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#69">436 U. S. 69</a></span> n. 27.  In this passage, the Committee reviewed various federal decisions relating to the question "whether a tribal Indian can successfully challenge on constitutional grounds specific acts or practices of the Indian tribe."  Senate Report 9.  With only one exception, these decisions held that federal courts lacked jurisdiction to review alleged constitutional violations by tribal officials because the provisions of the Bill of Rights were not binding on the tribes.  This section of the Senate Report which is included under the heading "Need for Legislation" indicates Congress\' concern over the Indian\'s lack of remedies for tribal constitutional violations.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Testimony before the Subcommittee indicated that the mere provision of constitutional rights to the tribes did not necessarily guarantee that those rights would be observed.  Mr. Lawrence Jaramillo, a former Governor of the Isleta Pueblo, testified that, despite the tribal constitution\'s guarantee of freedom of religion, the present tribal Governor had attempted to "alter certain religious procedures of the Catholic priest who resides on the reservation."  1965 Hearings 261, 264.  Mr. Jaramillo stated that the Governor "has been making his own laws and he has been making his own decisions and he has been making his own court rulings," and he implored the Subcommittee:</p>\n<p>"Honorable Senator Ervin, we ask you to see if we can have any protection on these constitutional rights.  We do not want to give jurisdiction to the State.  We want to keep it in Federal jurisdiction.  But we are asking this.  We know if we are not given justice that we would like to appeal a case to the Federal court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 264.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
