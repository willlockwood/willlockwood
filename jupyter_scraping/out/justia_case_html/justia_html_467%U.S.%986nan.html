Under the data-consideration provisions of \xc2\xa7 3, as amended in 1978, applicants now are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978, while all other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter.  If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding, and if an original submitter refuses to participate in negotiations or arbitration, he forfeits his claim for compensation.  Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation.  Section 10, as amended in 1978, authorizes, in general, public disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data even though it may result in disclosure of trade secrets.  Appellee, a company headquartered in Missouri, is an inventor, producer, and seller of pesticides, and invests substantial sums in developing active ingredients for pesticides and in producing end-use products that combine such ingredients with inert ingredients.  Appellee brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging, <em>inter alia,</em> that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effected a "taking" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose.  The District Court held that the challenged provisions of FIFRA are unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those provisions. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="987">Page 467 U. S. 987</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. To the extent that appellee has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Despite their intangible nature, trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more traditional forms of property.  Moreover, this Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Clause.

EPA\'s consideration or disclosure of data submitted by appellee prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking, but EPA\'s consideration or disclosure of certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting a trade secret under state law and submitted by appellee between those two dates may constitute a taking under certain conditions.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1004">467 U. S. 1004</a></span>-1014.</p>\n<p>(a) A factor for consideration in determining whether a governmental action short of acquisition or destruction of property has gone beyond proper "regulation" and effects a "taking" is whether the action interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations.  With respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that appellee submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments (October 1, 1978), appellee could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself.  As long as appellee is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1005">467 U. S. 1005</a></span>-1008.</p>\n<p>(b) Prior to its amendment in 1972 (effective October 22, 1972), FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA\'s authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration.  Although the Trade Secrets Act provides a criminal penalty for a Government employee who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information revealed to him during the course of his official duties, it is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, appellee had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information submitted to EPA before October 22, 1972, would remain inviolate in the EPA\'s hands.  The possibility was substantial that the Federal Government at some future time would find disclosure to be in the public interest.  <em>A fortiori,</em> the Trade Secrets Act, which penalizes only unauthorized disclosure, cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency </p><p><a class="page-number" name="988">Page 467 U. S. 988</a></p><p> use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">467 U. S. 1008</span>-1010.</p>\n<p>(c) However, under the statutory scheme in effect between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission.  The explicit governmental guarantee to registration applicants of confidentiality and exclusive use with respect to trade secrets during this period formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If EPA, consistent with current provisions of FIFRA, were now to disclose such trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, its actions would frustrate appellee\'s reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If, however, arbitration pursuant to FIFRA were to yield just compensation for the loss in the market value of appellee\'s trade secret data suffered because of EPA\'s consideration of the data in connection with another application (no arbitration having yet occurred), then appellee would have no claim against the Government for a taking.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1010">467 U. S. 1010</a></span>-1014.</p>\n<p>3. Any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA\'s use of data submitted to it by appellee between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a "public use," rather than for a "private use," even though subsequent applicants may be the most direct beneficiaries.  So long as a taking has a conceivable public character, the means by which it will be attained is for Congress to determine.  Congress believed that the data-consideration provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly.  Such a procompetitive purpose is within Congress\' police power.  With regard to FIFRA\'s data-disclosure provisions, the optimum amount of disclosure to assure the public that a product is safe and effective is to be determined by Congress, not the courts.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1014">467 U. S. 1014</a></span>-1016.</p>\n<p>4. A Tucker Act remedy is available to provide appellee with just compensation for any taking of property that may occur as a result of FIFRA\'s data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions, and thus the District Court erred in enjoining EPA from acting under those provisions.  Neither FIFRA nor its legislative history discusses the interaction between FIFRA and the Tucker Act, and inferring a withdrawal of Tucker Act jurisdiction would amount to a disfavored partial repeal by implication of the Tucker Act.  FIFRA\'s provision that an original submitter of data forfeits his right to compensation from a later submitter for the use of the original submitter\'s data if he fails to participate in, or comply with the terms of, a negotiated or arbitrated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="989">Page 467 U. S. 989</a></p><p> compensation settlement merely requires a claimant to first seek satisfaction through FIFRA\'s procedure before asserting a Tucker Act claim.

Because the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking appellee may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, appellee\'s challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme of FIFRA are not ripe for resolution.

The provisions at issue authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a pesticide [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Over the past century, the use of pesticides to control weeds and minimize crop damage caused by insects, disease, and animals has become increasingly more important for American agriculture.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 95-334, p. 32 (1977); S.Rep. No. 92-838, pp. 3-4, 6-7 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 92511, pp. 3-7 (1971).  While pesticide use has led to improvements in productivity, it has also led to increased risk of harm to humans and the environment.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 92-838, at 3-4, 6-7; H.R.Rep. NO. 92-511, at 3-7.  Although the Federal Government has regulated pesticide use for nearly 75 years, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] FIFRA was first adopted in 1947.  61 Stat. 163. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="991">Page 467 U. S. 991</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As first enacted, FIFRA was primarily a licensing and labeling statute.  It required that all pesticides be registered with the Secretary of Agriculture prior to their sale in interstate or foreign commerce.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(a) and 4(a) of the 1947 Act, 61 Stat. 166-167.  The 1947 legislation also contained general standards setting forth the types of information necessary for proper labeling of a registered pesticide, including directions for use; warnings to prevent harm to people, animals, and plants; and claims made about the efficacy of the product.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2(u)(2) and 3(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Upon request of the Secretary, an applicant was required to submit test data supporting the claims on the label, including the formula for the pesticide.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4(a) and (b).  The 1947 version of FIFRA specifically prohibited disclosure of "any information relative to formulas of products," \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(c)(4) and 8(c), but was silent with respect to the disclosure of any of the health and safety data submitted with an application. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1970, the Department of Agriculture\'s FIFRA responsibilities were transferred to the then newly created Environmental Protection Agency, whose Administrator is the appellant in this case.  <em>See</em> Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 35 Fed.Reg. 15623 (1970), 5 U.S.C.App. p. 1132.</p>\n<p>Because of mounting public concern about the safety of pesticides and their effect on the environment, and because of a growing perception that the existing legislation was not equal to the task of safeguarding the public interest, <em>see</em> S.Rep. No. 92-838, at 3-9; S.Rep. No. 92-970, p. 9 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, at 5-13, Congress undertook a comprehensive revision of FIFRA through the adoption of the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 973.  The amendments transformed FIFRA from a labeling law into a comprehensive regulatory statute.  H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, at 1.  As amended, FIFRA regulated the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="992">Page 467 U. S. 992</a></p><p> use, as well as the sale and labeling, of pesticides; regulated pesticides produced and sold in both intrastate and interstate commerce; provided for review, cancellation, and suspension of registration; and gave EPA greater enforcement authority.  Congress also added a new criterion for registration:  that EPA determine that the pesticide will not cause "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment."  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(c)(5)(C) and (D), 86 Stat. 980-981.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this litigation, the most significant of the 1972 amendments pertained to the pesticide registration procedure and the public disclosure of information learned through that procedure.  Congress added to FIFRA a new section governing public disclosure of data submitted in support of an application for registration.  Under that section, the submitter of data could designate any portions of the submitted material it believed to be "trade secrets or commercial or financial information."  \xc2\xa7 10(a), 86 Stat. 989.  Another section prohibited EPA from publicly disclosing information which, in its judgment, contained or related to "trade secrets or commercial or financial information."  \xc2\xa7 10(b).  In the event that EPA disagreed with a submitter\'s designation of certain information as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" and proposed to disclose that information, the original submitter could institute a declaratory judgment action in federal district court.  \xc2\xa7 10(c).</p>\n<p>The 1972 amendments also included a provision that allowed EPA to consider data submitted by one applicant for registration in support of another application pertaining to a similar chemical, provided the subsequent applicant offered to compensate the applicant who originally submitted the data.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D).  In effect, the provision instituted a mandatory data-licensing scheme.  The amount of compensation was to be negotiated by the parties, or, in the event negotiations failed, was to be determined by EPA, subject to judicial review upon the instigation of the original data submitter.  The scope of the 1972 data-consideration provision, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="993">Page 467 U. S. 993</a></p><p> was limited, for any data designated as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" exempt from disclosure under \xc2\xa7 10 could not be considered at all by EPA to support another registration application unless the original submitter consented.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The 1972 amendments did not specify standards for the designation of submitted data as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information."  In addition, Congress failed to designate an effective date for the data-consideration and disclosure schemes.  In 1975, Congress amended \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D) to provide that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions applied only to data submitted on or after January 1, 1970, 89 Stat. 755, but left the definitional question unanswered.</p>\n<p>Much litigation centered around the definition of "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" for the purposes of the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA.  EPA maintained that the exemption from consideration or disclosure applied only to a narrow range of information, principally statements of formulae and manufacturing processes.  In a series of lawsuits, however, data-submitting firms challenged EPA\'s interpretation and obtained several decisions to the effect that the term "trade secrets" applied to any data, including health, safety, and environmental data, that met the definition of trade secrets set forth in Restatement of Torts \xc2\xa7 757 (1939).  <em>See, e.g., Mobay Chemical Corp. v.

No. 95-334, at 34-68, Congress enacted other amendments to FIFRA in 1978.  These were effected by the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 819.  The new amendments included a series of revisions in the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA\'s \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3 and 10, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 136a and 136h.  Under FIFRA, as amended in 1978, applicants are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(i).  All other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  If the parties cannot agree on the amount of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="995">Page 467 U. S. 995</a></p><p> compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding.  The results of the arbitration proceeding are not subject to judicial review, absent fraud or misrepresentation.  The same statute provides that an original submitter who refuses to participate in negotiations or in the arbitration proceeding forfeits his claim for compensation.  Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(iii).</p>\n<p>Also in 1978, Congress added a new subsection, \xc2\xa7 10(d), 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136h(d), that provides for disclosure of all health, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="996">Page 467 U. S. 996</a></p><p> safety, and environmental data to qualified requesters, notwithstanding the prohibition against disclosure of trade secrets contained in \xc2\xa7 10(b).  The provision, however, does not authorize disclosure of information that would reveal "manufacturing or quality control processes" or certain details about deliberately added inert ingredients unless</p>\n<p>"the Administrator has first determined that the disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 10(d)(1)(A) to (C).

S. 997</a></p><p> the data consents to the disclosure.  \xc2\xa7 10(g).  Another subsection establishes a criminal penalty for wrongful disclosure by a Government employee or contractor of confidential or trade secret data.  \xc2\xa7 10(f).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellee Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is an inventor, developer, and producer of various kinds of chemical products, including pesticides.  Monsanto, headquartered in St. Louis County, Mo., sells in both domestic and foreign markets.  It is one of a relatively small group of companies that invent and develop new active ingredients for pesticides and conduct most of the research and testing with respect to those ingredients. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>These active ingredients are sometimes referred to as "manufacturing-use products" because they are not generally sold directly to users of pesticides.  Rather, they must first be combined with "inert ingredients" -- chemicals that dissolve, dilute, or stabilize the active components.  The results of this process are sometimes called "end-use products," and the firms that produce end-use products are called "formulators."  <em>See</em> the opinion of the District Court in this case, <em>Monsanto Co. v. Acting Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency,</em> 564 F.Supp. 552, 554 (ED Mo.1983).  A firm that produces an active ingredient may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="998">Page 467 U. S. 998</a></p><p> use it for incorporation into its own end-use products, may sell it to formulators, or may do both.  Monsanto produces both active ingredients and end-use products.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The District Court found that development of a potential commercial pesticide candidate typically requires the expenditure of $5 million to $15 million annually for several years.  The development process may take between 14 and 22 years, and it is usually that long before a company can expect any return on its investment.  <em>Id.</em> at 555.  For every manufacturing-use pesticide the average company finally markets, it will have screened and tested 20,000 others.  Monsanto has a significantly better-than-average success rate; it successfully markets 1 out of every 10,000 chemicals tested.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Monsanto, like any other applicant for registration of a pesticide, must present research and test data supporting its application.  The District Court found that Monsanto had incurred costs in excess of $23.6 million in developing the health, safety, and environmental data submitted by it under FIFRA.  <em>Id.</em> at 560.  The information submitted with an application usually has value to Monsanto beyond its instrumentality in gaining that particular application.  Monsanto uses this information to develop additional end-use products and to expand the uses of its registered products.  The information would also be valuable to Monsanto\'s competitors.  For that reason, Monsanto has instituted stringent security measures to ensure the secrecy of the data.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>It is this health, safety, and environmental data that Monsanto sought to protect by bringing this suit.  The District Court found that much of these data "contai[n] or relat[e] to trade secrets as defined by the Restatement of Torts and Confidential, commercial information."  <em>Id.</em> at 562.</p>\n<p>Monsanto brought suit in District Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief from the operation of the data-consideration provisions of FIFRA\'s \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D), and the data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA\'s \xc2\xa7 10 and the related \xc2\xa7 3(c)(2)(A).   Monsanto alleged that all of the challenged provisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="999">Page 467 U. S. 999</a></p><p> effected a "taking" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  In addition, Monsanto alleged that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose.  Finally, Monsanto alleged that the arbitration scheme provided by \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) violates the original submitter\'s due process rights, and constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power.</p>\n<p>After a bench trial, the District Court concluded that Monsanto possessed property rights in its submitted data, specifically including the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of such data by preventing their unauthorized use and by prohibiting their disclosure.  564 F.Supp. at 566.  The court found that the challenged data-consideration provisions "give Monsanto\'s competitors a free ride at Monsanto\'s expense."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court reasoned that \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D) appropriated Monsanto\'s fundamental right to exclude, and that the effect of that appropriation is substantial.  The court further found that Monsanto\'s property was being appropriated for a private purpose, and that this interference was much more significant than the public good that the appropriation might serve.  564 F.Supp. at 566-567.</p>\n<p>The District Court also found that operation of the disclosure provisions of FIFRA constituted a taking of Monsanto\'s property.  The cost incurred by Monsanto when its property is "permanently committed to the public domain and thus effectively destroyed" was viewed by the District Court as significantly outweighing any benefit to the general public from having the ability to scrutinize the data, for the court seemed to believe that the general public could derive all the assurance it needed about the safety and effectiveness of a pesticide from EPA\'s decision to register the product and to approve the label.  <em>Id.</em> at 567, and n. 4.</p>\n<p>After finding that the data-consideration provisions operated to effect a taking of property, the District Court found </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1000">Page 467 U. S. 1000</a></p><p> that the compulsory binding arbitration scheme set forth in \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) did not adequately provide compensation for the property taken.  The court found the arbitration provision to be arbitrary and vague, reasoning that the statute does not give arbitrators guidance as to the factors that enter into the concept of just compensation, and that judicial review is foreclosed except in cases of fraud.  564 F.Supp. at 567.  The District Court also found that the arbitration scheme was infirm because it did not meet the requirements of Art. III of the Constitution.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Finally, the court found that a remedy under the Tucker Act was not available for the deprivations of property effected by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3 and 10.  564 F.Supp. at 567-568.</p>\n<p>The District Court therefore declared \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D), 3(c)(2)(A), 10(b), and 10(d) of FIFRA, as amended by the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, to be unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those sections.  <em>See</em> Amended Judgment, App. to Juris.Statement 41a.

(2) If so, does EPA\'s use of the data to evaluate the applications of others or EPA\'s disclosure of the data to qualified members of the public effect a taking of that property interest? (3) If there </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1001">Page 467 U. S. 1001</a></p><p> is a taking, is it a taking for a public use? (4) If there is a taking for a public use, does the statute adequately provide for just compensation?</p>\n<p>For purposes of this case, EPA has stipulated that</p>\n<p>"Monsanto has certain property rights in its information, research and test data that it has submitted under FIFRA to EPA and its predecessor agencies which may be protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."</p>\n<p>App. 36.  Since the exact import of that stipulation is not clear, we address the question whether the data at issue here can be considered property for the purposes of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>This Court never has squarely addressed the applicability of the protections of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment to commercial data of the kind involved in this case.  In answering the question now, we are mindful of the basic axiom that</p>\n<p>"\'[p]roperty interests . . . are not created by the Constitution.  Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Webb\'s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.

Monsanto asserts that the health, safety, and environmental data it has submitted to EPA are property under Missouri law, which recognizes trade secrets, as defined in \xc2\xa7 757, Comment b, of the Restatement of Torts, as property.  <em>See Reddi-Wip, Inc. v. Lemay Valve Co.,</em> 354 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Mo.App.1962); <em>Harrington v. National Outdoor Advertising Co.,</em> 355 Mo. 524, 532, 196 S.W.2d 786, 791 (1946); <em>Luckett v. Orange Julep Co.,</em> 271 Mo. 289, 302-304, 196 S.W. 740, 743 (1917).  The Restatement defines a trade secret as</p>\n<p>"any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one\'s business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 757, Comment b.  And the parties have stipulated that much of the information, research, and test data that Monsanto has submitted under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1002">Page 467 U. S. 1002</a></p><p> FIFRA to EPA "contains or relates to trade secrets as defined by the Restatement of Torts."  App. 36.</p>\n<p>Because of the intangible nature of a trade secret, the extent of the property right therein is defined by the extent to which the owner of the secret protects his interest from disclosure to others.  <em>See Harrington, supra; Reddi-Wip, supra;</em> Restatement of Torts, <em>supra; see also Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/470/case.html">416 U.

Information that is public knowledge or that is generally known in an industry cannot be a trade secret.  Restatement of Torts, <em>supra.</em>  If an individual discloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information, or otherwise publicly discloses the secret, his property right is extinguished.  <em>See Harrington, supra;</em> 1 R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets \xc2\xa7 1.01[2] (1983).</p>\n<p>Trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more tangible forms of property.  A trade secret is assignable.  <em>See, e.g., Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/220/373/case.html">220 U.

Bourns, Inc.,</em> 442 F.2d 216, 225 (CA2 1971).  A trade secret can form the <em>res</em> of a trust, Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7 82, Comment e (1959); 1 A. Scott, Law of Trusts \xc2\xa7 82.5, p. 703 (3d ed.1967), and it passes to a trustee in bankruptcy.  <em>See In re Uniservices, Inc.,</em> 517 F.2d 492, 496-497 (CA7 1975).</p>\n<p>Even the manner in which Congress referred to trade secrets in the legislative history of FIFRA supports the general perception of their property-like nature.  In discussing the 1978 amendments to FIFRA, Congress recognized that data developers like Monsanto have a "proprietary interest" in their data.  S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 31.  Further, Congress reasoned that submitters of data are "entitled" to "compensation" because they "have legal ownership of the data."  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1560, p. 29 (1978). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This general </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1003">Page 467 U. S. 1003</a></p><p> perception of trade secrets as property is consonant with a notion of "property" that extends beyond land and tangible goods and includes the products of an individual\'s "labour and invention."  2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *405; <em>see generally</em> J. Locke, The Second Treatise of Civil Government, ch. 5 (J. Gough ed.1947).</p>\n<p>Although this Court never has squarely addressed the question whether a person can have a property interest in a trade secret, which is admittedly intangible, the Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Fifth Amendment\'s Taking Clause.  <em>See, e.g., Armstrong v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/40/case.html">364 U. S. 40</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/40/case.html#44">364 U.

That intangible property rights protected by state law are deserving of the protection of the Taking Clause has long been implicit in the thinking of this Court:</p>\n<p>"It is conceivable that [the term \'property\' in the Taking Clause] was used in its vulgar and untechnical sense of the physical thing with respect to which the citizen exercises rights recognized by law.  On the other hand, it may have been employed in a more accurate sense to denote the group of rights inhering in the citizen\'s relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of it.

The question of what constitutes a "taking" is one with which this Court has wrestled on many occasions.  It has never been the rule that only governmental acquisition or destruction of the property of an individual constitutes a taking, for</p>\n<p>"courts have held that the deprivation of the former owner, rather than the accretion of a right or interest </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1005">Page 467 U. S. 1005</a></p><p> to the sovereign constitutes the taking.

It is to the last of these three factors that we now direct our attention, for we find that the force of this factor is so overwhelming, at least with respect to certain of the data submitted by Monsanto to EPA, that it disposes of the taking question regarding those data.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>A "reasonable investment-backed expectation" must be more than a "unilateral expectation or an abstract need."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1006">Page 467 U.

We find that, with respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that Monsanto submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments -- that is, on or after October 1, 1978 [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] -- Monsanto could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself.  Monsanto was on notice of the manner in which EPA was authorized to use and disclose any data turned over to it by an applicant for registration.</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to any data submitted to EPA on or after October 1, 1978, Monsanto knew that, for a period of 10 years from the date of submission, EPA would not consider those data in evaluating the application of another without Monsanto\'s permission.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(i).  It was also aware, however, that, once the 10-year period had expired, EPA could use the data without Monsanto\'s permission.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) and (iii).  Monsanto was further aware that it was entitled to an offer of compensation from the subsequent applicant only until the end of the 15th year from the date of submission.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(iii).  In addition, Monsanto was aware that information relating to formulae of products could be revealed by EPA to "any Federal agency consulted and [could] be revealed at a public hearing or in findings of fact" issued by EPA "when necessary to carry out" EPA\'s duties under FIFRA.  \xc2\xa7 10(b).  The statute also gave Monsanto notice that much of the health, safety, and efficacy data provided by it could be disclosed to the general public at any time.  \xc2\xa7 10(d).  If, despite the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions in the statute, Monsanto chose to submit the requisite data in order to receive a registration, it can hardly argue that its reasonable investment-</p><p><a class="page-number" name="1007">Page 467 U. S. 1007</a></p><p>backed expectations are disturbed when EPA acts to use or disclose the data in a manner that was authorized by law at the time of the submission.</p>\n<p>Monsanto argues that the statute\'s requirement that a submitter give up its property interest in the data constitutes placing an unconstitutional condition on the right to a valuable Government benefit.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellee 29.  But Monsanto has not challenged the ability of the Federal Government to regulate the marketing and use of pesticides.

This is particularly true in an area, such as pesticide sale and use, that has long been the source of public concern and the subject of government regulation.  That Monsanto is willing to bear this burden in exchange for the ability to market pesticides in this country is evidenced by the fact that it has continued to expand its research and development and to submit data to EPA despite the enactment of the 1978 amendments to FIFRA.

United States Nuclear Reglatory Comm\'n,</em> 555 F.2d 82, 95 (CA3 1977).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Prior to the 1972 amendments, FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA\'s authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration.  Another statute, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1905, however, arguably is relevant.  That Act is a general criminal statute that provides a penalty for any employee of the United States Government who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information that is revealed to him during the course of his official duties.  This Court has determined that \xc2\xa7 1905 is more than an "anti-leak" statute aimed at deterring Government employees from profiting by information they receive in their official capacities.  <em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Brow,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/case.html">441 U. S. 281</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/case.html#298">441 U. S. 298</a></span>-301 (1979).  Rather, \xc2\xa7 1905 also applies to formal agency action, <em>i.e.,</em> action approved by the agency or department head.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>It is true that, prior to the 1972 amendments, neither FIFRA nor any other provision of law gave EPA authority to disclose data obtained from Monsanto.  But the Trade Secrets Act is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, Monsanto had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information would remain inviolate in the hands of EPA.  In an industry that long has been the focus of great public concern and significant government regulation, the possibility was substantial that the Federal Government, which had thus far taken no position on disclosure of health, safety, and environmental data concerning pesticides, upon focusing on the issue, would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1009">Page 467 U. S. 1009</a></p><p> find disclosure to be in the public interest.  Thus, with respect to data submitted to EPA in connection with an application for registration prior to October 22, 1972, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] the Trade Secrets Act provided no basis for a reasonable investment-backed expectation that data submitted to EPA would remain confidential.</p>\n<p><em>A fortiori,</em> the Trade Secrets Act cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Indeed, there is some evidence that the practice of using data submitted by one company during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant was widespread and well known. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1010">Page 467 U. S. 1010</a></p><p> with respect to any data that Monsanto submitted to EPA prior to the effective date of the 1972 amendments to FIFRA, we hold that Monsanto could not have had a "reasonable investment-backed expectation" that EPA would maintain those data in strictest confidence and would use them exclusively for the purpose of considering the Monsanto application in connection with which the data were submitted.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The situation may be different, however, with respect to data submitted by Monsanto to EPA during the period from October 22, 1972, through September 30, 1978.  Under the statutory scheme then in effect, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission.  When Monsanto provided data to EPA during this period, it was with the understanding, embodied in FIFRA, that EPA was free to use any of the submitted data that were not trade secrets in considering the application of another, provided </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1011">Page 467 U. S. 1011</a></p><p> that EPA required the subsequent applicant to pay "reasonable compensation" to the original submitter.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D), 86 Stat. 979.  But the statute also gave Monsanto explicit assurance that EPA was prohibited from disclosing publicly, or considering in connection with the application of another, any data submitted by an applicant if both the applicant and EPA determined the data to constitute trade secrets.  \xc2\xa7 10, 86 Stat. 989.  Thus, with respect to trade secrets submitted under the statutory regime in force between the time of the adoption of the 1972 amendments and the adoption of the 1978 amendments, the Federal Government had explicitly guaranteed to Monsanto and other registration applicants an extensive measure of confidentiality and exclusive use.  This explicit governmental guarantee formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If EPA, consistent with the authority granted it by the 1978 FIFRA amendments, were now to disclose trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, EPA\'s actions would frustrate Monsanto\'s reasonable investment-backed expectation with respect to its control over the use and dissemination of the data it had submitted.</p>\n<p>The right to exclude others is generally "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property."  <em>Kaiser-Aetna,</em> 444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/164/case.html#176">444 U. S. 176</a></span>.  With respect to a trade secret, the right to exclude others is central to the very definition of the property interest.  Once the data that constitute a trade secret are disclosed to others, or others are allowed to use those data, the holder of the trade secret has lost his property interest in the data.

S. 1012</a></p><p> That the data retain usefulness for Monsanto even after they are disclosed -- for example, as bases from which to develop new products or refine old products, as marketing and advertising tools, or as information necessary to obtain registration in foreign countries -- is irrelevant to the determination of the economic impact of the EPA action on Monsanto\'s property right.  The economic value of that property right lies in the competitive advantage over others that Monsanto enjoys by virtue of its exclusive access to the data, and disclosure or use by others of the data would destroy that competitive edge.</p>\n<p>EPA encourages us to view the situation not as a taking of Monsanto\'s property interest in the trade secrets, but as a "preemption" of whatever property rights Monsanto may have had in those trade secrets.

Thus, it is said, the Supremacy Clause dictates that the scheme not vary depending on the property law of the State in which the submitter is located.  <em>Id.</em> at 28.  This argument proves too much.  If Congress can "preempt" state property law in the manner advocated by EPA, then the Taking Clause has lost all vitality.

It is true that the most direct beneficiaries of EPA actions under the data-consideration provisions of FIFRA will be the later applicants who will support their applications by citation to data submitted by Monsanto or some other original submitter.  Because of the data-consideration provisions, later applicants will not have to replicate the sometimes intensive and complex research necessary to produce the requisite data.

Congress believed that the provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly.  Allowing applicants for registration, upon payment of compensation, to use data already accumulated by others, rather than forcing them to go through the time-consuming process of repeating the research, would eliminate a significant barrier to entry into the pesticide market, thereby allowing greater competition among producers of end-use products.

Instead, the court found that the data-disclosure provisions served no use.  It reasoned that, because EPA, before registration, must determine that a product is safe and effective, and because the label on a pesticide, by statute, must set forth the nature, contents, and purpose of the pesticide, the label provided the public with all the assurance it needed that the product is safe and effective.  564 F.Supp. at 567, and n. 4.

Here, contrary to Monsanto\'s claim, it is entirely possible for the Tucker Act and FIFRA to co-exist.  The better interpretation, therefore, of the FIFRA language on forfeiture, which gives force to both the Tucker Act and the FIFRA provision, is to read FIFRA as implementing an exhaustion requirement as a precondition to a Tucker Act claim.  That is, FIFRA does not withdraw the possibility of a Tucker Act remedy, but merely requires that a claimant first seek satisfaction through the statutory procedure.  <em>Cf.

[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>With respect to data disclosure to the general public, FIFRA provides for no compensation whatsoever.  Thus, Monsanto\'s argument that Congress intended the compensation scheme provided in FIFRA to be exclusive has no relevance to the data-disclosure provisions of \xc2\xa7 10.</p>\n<p>Congress in FIFRA did not address the liability of the Government to pay just compensation should a taking occur.  Congress\' failure specifically to mention or provide for recourse </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1019">Page 467 U. S. 1019</a></p><p> against the Government may reflect a congressional belief that use of data by EPA in the ways authorized by FIFRA effects no Fifth Amendment taking, or it may reflect Congress\' assumption that the general grant of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act would provide the necessary remedy for any taking that may occur.  In any event, the failure cannot be construed to reflect an unambiguous intention to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy.  "[W]hether or not the United States so intended," any taking claim under FIFRA is one "founded . . . upon the Constitution," and is thus remediable under the Tucker Act.  <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</em> 419 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#126">419 U.

Therefore, where the operation of the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effect a taking of property belonging to Monsanto, an adequate remedy for the taking exists under the Tucker Act.  The District Court erred in enjoining the taking.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because we hold that the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking Monsanto may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, we conclude that Monsanto\'s challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme are not ripe for our resolution.  Because of the availability of the Tucker Act, Monsanto\'s ability to obtain just compensation does not depend solely on the validity of the statutory compensation scheme.  The operation of the arbitration procedure affects only Monsanto\'s ability to vindicate its statutory right to obtain compensation from a subsequent applicant whose registration application relies on data originally submitted by Monsanto, not its ability to vindicate its constitutional right to just compensation.</p>\n<p>Monsanto did not allege or establish that it had been injured by actual arbitration under the statute.  While the District Court acknowledged that Monsanto had received several offers of compensation from applicants for registration, 564 F.Supp. at 561, it did not find that EPA had considered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1020">Page 467 U. S. 1020</a></p><p> Monsanto\'s data in considering another application.  Further, Monsanto and any subsequent applicant may negotiate and reach agreement concerning an outstanding offer.  If they do not reach agreement, then the controversy must go to arbitration.

We approach the question somewhat differently.  The word property, as applied to trademarks and trade secrets, is an unanalyzed expression of certain secondary consequences of the primary fact that the law makes some rudimentary requirements of good faith.  Whether the plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not, the defendant knows the facts, whatever they are, through a special confidence that he accepted.  The property may be denied, but the confidence cannot be.  Therefore the starting point for the present matter is not property or due process of law, but that the defendant stood in confidential relations with the plaintiffs."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/100/case.html#102">244 U.

Acting Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency,</em> 564 F.Supp. 552, 564 (ED Mo.1983) (emphasis in original).  The District Court apparently based this finding on the testimony of two former Directors of the Pesticide Regulation Division, who testified that they knew of no instance in which data submitted by one applicant were subsequently considered in evaluating another application.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>This finding is in marked conflict with the statement of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, presented before a Senate Subcommittee in 1972, which advocated that the 1972 amendments to FIFRA should contain an exclusive-use provision:</p>\n<p>"Under the present law, registration information submitted to the Administrator has not routinely been made available for public inspection.  Such information has, however, as a matter of practice but without statutory authority, been considered by the Administrator to support the registration of the same or a similar product by another registrant."</p>\n<p>Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act:  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Agricultural Research and General Legislation of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 245 (1972).  In addition, EPA points to the Department of Agriculture\'s Interpretation with Respect to Warning, Caution and Antidote Statements Required to Appear on Labels of Economic Poisons, 27 Fed.Reg. 2267 (1962), which presents a list of pesticides that would require no additional toxicological data for registration.  The clear implication from the Interpretation is that the Department determined that the data already submitted with respect to those chemicals would be sufficient for purposes of evaluating any future applications for registration of those chemicals.</p>\n<p>Although the evidence against the District Court\'s finding seems overwhelming, we need not determine that the finding was clearly erroneous in order to find that a submitter had no reasonable expectation that the Department or EPA would not use the data it had submitted when evaluating the application of another.  The District Court did not find that the policy of the Department was publicly known at the time, or that there was any explicit guarantee of exclusive use.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We emphasize that the value of a trade secret lies in the competitive advantage it gives its owner over competitors.  Thus, it is the fact that operation of the data-consideration or data-disclosure provisions will allow a competitor to register more easily its product or to use the disclosed data to improve its own technology that may constitute a taking.  If, however, a public disclosure of data reveals, for example, the harmful side effects of the submitter\'s product and causes the submitter to suffer a decline in the potential profits from sales of the product, that decline in profits stems from a decrease in the value of the pesticide to consumers, rather than from the destruction of an edge the submitter had over its competitors, and cannot constitute the taking of a trade secret.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the record contains no findings with respect to the value of the trade secret data at issue, and because no arbitration proceeding has yet been held to detemine the amount of recovery to be paid by a subsequent applicant to Monsanto, we cannot preclude the possibility that the arbitration award will be sufficient to provide Monsanto with just compensation, thus nullifying any claim against the Government for a taking when EPA uses Monsanto\'s data in considering another application.  The statutory arbitration scheme, of course, provides for compensation only in cases where the data are considered in connection with a subsequent application, not in cases of disclosure of the data.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>While the 1975 amendments to FIFRA purported to carry backward the protections against data consideration and data disclosure to submissions of data made on or after January 1, 1970, 89 Stat. 751, the relevant consideration for our purposes is the nature of the expectations of the submitter at the time the data were submitted.  We therefore do not extend our ruling as to a possible taking to data submitted prior to October 22, 1972.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Monsanto argues that EPA and, by implication, Congress misapprehended the true "barriers to entry" in the pesticide industry, and that the challenged provisions of the law create, rather than reduce, barriers to entry.  Brief for Appellee 35, n. 48.  Such economic arguments are better directed to Congress.  The proper inquiry before this Court is not whether the provisions in fact will accomplish their stated objectives.  Our review is limited to determining that the purpose is legitimate and that Congress rationally could have believed that the provisions would promote that objective.  <em>Midkiff, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/229/case.html#242">467 U.

S. 1013</a></span>, that "EPA\'s consideration or disclosure of data submitted by Monsanto to the agency prior to October 22, 1972, . . . does not effect a taking."  In my view, public disclosure of pre-1972 data would effect a taking.  As to consideration of this information within EPA in connection with other license applications not submitted by Monsanto, I believe we should remand to the District Court for further factual findings concerning Monsanto\'s expectations regarding interagency uses of trade secret infol mation prior to 1972.</p>\n<p>It is important to distinguish at the outset public disclosure of trade secrets from use of those secrets entirely within EPA.  Internal use may undermine Monsanto\'s competitive position within the United States, but it leaves Monsanto\'s position in foreign markets undisturbed.  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1007">467 U. S. 1007</a></span>, n. 11, the likely impact on foreign market position is one that Monsanto would weigh when deciding whether to submit trade secrets to EPA.  Thus, a submission of trade secrets to EPA that implicitly consented to further use of the information within the agency is not necessarily the same as one that implicitly consented to public disclosure.</p>\n<p>It seems quite clear -- indeed, the Court scarcely disputes -- that public disclosure of trade secrets submitted to the Federal Government before 1972 was neither permitted by law, nor customary agency practice before 1972, nor expected by applicants for pesticide registrations.  The Court correctly notes that the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1905, flatly proscribed such disclosures.  The District Court expressly found that, until 1970, it was Government</p>\n<p>"policy that the data developed and submitted by companies such as [Monsanto] be maintained confidentially by the [administrative agency], and was not to be disclosed without the permission of the data submitter."</p>\n<p><em>Molsanto Co. v. Acting Administrator, EPA,</em> 564 F.Supp. 552, 564 (1983).  Finally, the Court, <em>ante</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1022">Page 467 U. S. 1022</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1009">467 U. S. 1009</a></span>, n. 14, quotes from a 1972 statement by the National Agricultural Chemicals Association that "registration information submitted to the Administrator has not routinely been made available for public inspection."  It is hard to imagine how a pre-1972 applicant for a pesticide license would not, under these circumstances, have formed a very firm expectation that its trade secrets submitted in connection with a pesticide registration would not be disclosed to the public.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s analysis of this question appears in a single sentence:  an "industry that long has been the focus of great public concern and significant government regulation" can have no reasonable expectation that the Government will not later find public disclosure of trade secrets to be in the public interest.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">467 U. S. 1008</span>.  I am frankly puzzled to read this statement in the broader context of the Court\'s otherwise convincing opinion.  If the degree of Government regulation determines the reasonableness of an expectation of confidentiality, Monsanto had as little reason to expect confidentiality after 1972 as before, since the 1972 amendments were not deregulatory in intent or effect.  And the Court entirely fails to explain why the nondisclosure provision of the 1972 Act, \xc2\xa7 10, 86 Stat. 989, created any greater expectation of confidentiality than the Trade Secrets Act.  Section 10 prohibited EPA from disclosing "trade secrets or commercial or financial information."  No penalty for disclosure was prescribed, unless disclosure was with the intent to defraud.  The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1905, prohibited and still prohibits Government disclosure of trade secrets and other commercial or financial information revealed during the course of official duties, on pain of substantial criminal sanctions.  The Court acknowledges that this prohibition has always extended to formal and official agency action.  <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/case.html">441 U. S. 281</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/281/case.html#298">441 U. S. 298</a></span>-301 (1979).  It seems to me that the criminal sanctions in the Trade Secrets Act therefore created at least as strong an expectation of privacy before 1972 as the precatory language of \xc2\xa7 10 created after 1972. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1023">Page 467 U. S. 1023</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s tacit analysis seems to be this:  an expectation of confidentiality can be grounded only on a statutory nondisclosure provision situated in close physical proximity, in the pages of the United States Code, to the provisions pursuant to which information is submitted to the Government.  For my part, I see no reason why Congress should not be able to give effective protection to all trade secrets submitted to the Federal Government by means of a single, overarching, trade secrets provision.  We routinely assume that wrongdoers are put on notice of the entire contents of the Code, though in all likelihood most of them have never owned a copy or opened a single page of it.  It seems strange to assume, on the other hand, that a company like Monsanto, well served by lawyers who undoubtedly do read the Code, could build an expectation of privacy in pesticide trade secrets only if the assurance of confidentiality appeared in Title 7 itself.</p>\n<p>The question of interagency use of trade secrets before 1972 is more difficult, because the Trade Secrets Act most likely does not extend to such uses.  The District Court found that, prior to October 1972, only two competitors\' registrations were granted on the basis of data submitted by Monsanto, and that Monsanto had no knowledge of either of these registrations prior to their being granted.  564 F.Supp. at 564.  The District Court also found that, before 1970, it was agency policy</p>\n<p>"that the data developed and submitted by companies such as [Monsanto] could not be used to support the registration of another\'s product without the permission of the data submitter."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  This Court, however, concludes on the basis of two cited fragments of evidence that "the evidence against the District Court\'s finding seems overwhelming."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1010">467 U. S. 1010</a></span>, n. 14.  The Court nevertheless wisely declines to label the District Court\'s findings of fact on this matter clearly erroneous.  Instead, the Court notes that the</p>\n<p>"District Court did not find that the policy of the Department [of Agriculture] was publicly known at the time [before 1970,] or that there was any explicit guarantee of exclusive use."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  This begs exactly the right question, but the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1024">Page 467 U. S. 1024</a></p><p> Court firmly declines to answer it.  The Court simply states that</p>\n<p>"there is some evidence that the practice of using data submitted by one company during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant was widespread and well known."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1009">467 U. S. 1009</a></span> (footnote omitted). And then, without more ado, the Court declares that, with respect to pre-1972 data, Monsanto</p>\n<p>"could not have had a \'reasonable investment-backed expectation\' that EPA would . . . use [the data] exclusively for the purpose of considering the Monsanto application in connection with which the data were submitted."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1010">467 U.

It is fairly clear that the District Court found that those expectations existed as a matter of fact, and were reasonable as a matter of law.  But if the factual findings of the District Court on this precise question were not as explicit as they might have been, the appropriate disposition is to remand to the District Court for further factfinding.  That is the course I would follow with respect to interagency use of trade secrets submitted by Monsanto before 1972.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
