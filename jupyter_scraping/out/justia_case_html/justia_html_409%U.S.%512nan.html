S. 513</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question is whether 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] required the convening of a three-judge court in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to hear this case.  It is a class action brought by and on behalf of persons awaiting trial and confined in Philadelphia County prisons because either unable to afford bail or because charged with nonbailable offenses.  The complaint alleges that provisions of the Pennsylvania Election Code, in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, absolutely deny petitioners\' class the right to vote in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 409 U. S. 514</a></p><p> that they neither permit members of the class to leave prison to register and vote nor provide facilities for the purpose at the prisons, and in that they expressly prohibit persons "confined in penal institutions" from voting by absentee ballot. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The complaint names as defendants two Commonwealth officials, the Attorney General and Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, and certain municipal officials of the County and City of Philadelphia:  the City Commissioners of Philadelphia who constitute the Board of Elections and Registration Commission of the City and County of Philadelphia, the Voting Registration Supervisor for the City and County, and the Superintendent of Prisons for the County.</p>\n<p>On oral argument before a single judge on petitioners\' motion for a temporary restraining order, the Commonwealth officials appeared by a Deputy Attorney General, who conceded that the challenged provisions of the Election Code, as applied to petitioners\' class, were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The municipal officials, on the other hand, vigorously defended the constitutionality of the provisions as so applied.  The single judge deemed the contrary view of the municipal officials to be irrelevant, as he regarded the Commonwealth officials to be the "principal defendants."  <em>See</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 409 U. S. 515</a></p><p> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>infra</em> . He therefore ruled that the concession on behalf of the Commonwealth officials meant there was no case or controversy before the court as required by Art. III of the Constitution, and dismissed the complaint. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  On petitioners\' appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  452 F.2d 39 (1971).  We do not, however, read the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals as resting the affirmance on agreement with the single judge that the concession of the Commonwealth officials meant there was no case or controversy before the court.  Rather, we read the per curiam opinion as either implying disagreement with the single judge on that question or as at least assuming that a case or controversy existed, for the opinion states that, in the view of the Court of Appeals, petitioners\' constitutional claims were wholly insubstantial under <em>McDonald v. Board of Election Comm\'rs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/802/case.html">394 U. S. 802</a></span> (1969), in which circumstance, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 409 U. S. 516</a></p><p> the Court of Appeals held, <em>Bailey v. Patterson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/31/case.html">369 U. S. 31</a></span> (1962), was authority that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 did not require the assembly of a three-judge court, and that dismissal by the single judge was therefore proper, 452 F.2d at 40.  A petition for rehearing en banc was denied, three judges dissenting.  We granted certiorari, 408 U.S. 922 (1972).  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with direction to enter an appropriate order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 for the convening of a three-judge court to hear this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The single judge clearly erred in holding that the concession of the Commonwealth officials foreclosed the existence of a case or controversy.  All parties are in accord that Pennsylvania law did not oblige the municipal officials to defer to the concession of the Commonwealth officials, or otherwise give the Commonwealth officials a special status as "principal defendants." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]   Indeed, the brief filed in this Court by the Commonwealth officials forthrightly argues that</p>\n<p>"[t]he District Court made an egregious error.  The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Commonwealth are not the only defendants in this case.  The City Commissioners of Philadelphia, the Voting Registration Supervisor, the Registration Commission, and the Superintendent of Prisons for Philadelphia County are also parties.  These parties have contested vigorously the issues raised by petitioners both in the District Court and on appeal.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 409 U. S. 517</a></p><p> They have provided adversity of interest, and will sharply define the issues, to the extent they are not already clear."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondents Commonwealth of Pennsylvania <em>et al.</em> 4-5. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, there is satisfied the requisite of Art. III that "[t]he constitutional question . . . be presented in the context of a specific live grievance."  <em>Golden v. Zwickler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/103/case.html">394 U.

As between petitioners and the municipal officials, the District Court was "called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies," <em>Liverpool, N. Y. &amp; P. S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/113/33/case.html">113 U.

S. 90</a></span> (1947).  Since the municipal officials persist in their asserted right to enforce the challenged provisions of the Election Code, there is a "real and substantial controversy" "touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests," <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/227/case.html">300 U.

Board of Election Comm\'rs, supra,</em> rendered petitioners\' constitutional claims wholly insubstantial.</p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281 does not require the convening of a three-judge court when the constitutional attack upon the state statutes is insubstantial.  "Constitutional insubstantiality" for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as "essentially fictitious," <em>Bailey v. Patterson,</em> 369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/31/case.html#33">369 U. S. 33</a></span>; "wholly insubstantial," <em>ibid.;</em> "obviously frivolous," <em>Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/216/285/case.html">216 U. S. 285</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/216/285/case.html#288">216 U.

The limiting words "wholly" and "obviously" have cogent legal significance.  In the context of the effect of prior decisions upon the substantiality of constitutional claims, those words import that claims are constitutionally insubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous; previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281.  A claim is insubstantial only if</p>\n<p>"\'its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ex parte Poresky, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/290/30/case.html#32">290 U.

Under this test, it is clear that <em>McDonald</em> is not a prior decision of this Court that "foreclose[s] the subject" of petitioners\' constitutional attack upon the Pennsylvania statutory scheme; it is demonstrably not a decision that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 409 U.

Their timely applications to the Cook County Board of Election Commissioners for absentee ballots were denied on the ground that pretrial detainees were not included among those persons specifically permitted by the Illinois Election Code to vote by absentee ballot.  Appellants brought suit alleging that, in that circumstance, the Illinois Election Code denied them equal protection of the laws, particularly as the Code provided absentee ballots for those "medically incapacitated," and for pretrial detainees who were residents of Cook County but incarcerated outside of Cook County. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The threshold question presented in <em>McDonald</em> was</p>\n<p>"how stringent a standard to use in evaluating the classifications made [by the Illinois absentee ballot provisions] and whether the distinctions must be justified by a compelling state interest. . . ."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/802/case.html#806">394 U. S. 806</a></span>.  In resolving this question, the Court analyzed the Illinois scheme in light of our decisions that required the application of the more stringent compelling state interest test when either a fundamental right, such as the right to vote, was allegedly infringed, <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span> (1964); <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/663/case.html">Harper v.

Our analysis led us to conclude that neither situation was presented by the Illinois absentee voting provisions.  We held that "the distinctions made by Illinois\' absentee provisions are not drawn on the basis of wealth or race," <em>ibid.,</em> and, with respect to the alleged infringement of appellants\' right to vote, that:</p>\n<p>"[T]here is nothing in the record to indicate that the Illinois statutory scheme has an impact on appellants\' ability to exercise the fundamental right to vote.  It is thus not the right to vote that is at stake here, but a claimed right to receive absentee ballots.  Despite appellants\' claim to the contrary, the absentee statutes, which are designed to make voting more available to some groups who cannot easily get to the polls, do not themselves deny appellants the exercise of the franchise; nor, indeed, does Illinois\' Election Code so operate as a whole, for the State\'s statutes specifically disenfranchise only those who have been convicted and sentenced, and not those similarly situated to appellants.  [Citation omitted.]  <em>Faced as we are with a constitutional question, we cannot lightly assume, with nothing in the record to support such an assumption, that Illinois has in fact precluded appellants from voting.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/802/case.html#807">394 U.

(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>For all that appeared, Illinois might make the franchise available by other means:</p>\n<p>"Appellants agree that the record is barren of any indication that the State might not, for instance, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 409 U.

S. 809</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' constitutional challenges to the Pennsylvania scheme are in sharp contrast.  Petitioners allege [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] that, unlike the appellants in <em>McDonald,</em> the Pennsylvania statutory scheme absolutely prohibits them from voting, both because a specific provision affirmatively excludes "persons confined in a penal institution" from voting by absentee ballot, Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 25, \xc2\xa7 2602(w)(12) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 409 U. S. 522</a></p><p> (Supp. 1972-1973), and because requests by members of petitioners\' class to register and to vote either by absentee ballot, or by personal or proxy appearance at polling places outside the prison, or at polling booths and registration facilities set up at the prisons, or generally by any means satisfactory to the election officials, had been denied.  Thus, petitioners\' complaint alleges a situation that <em>McDonald</em> itself suggested might make a different case.</p>\n<p>This is not to say, of course, that petitioners are, as a matter of law, entitled to the relief sought.  We neither decide nor intimate any view upon the merits. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It suffices that we hold that <em>McDonald</em> does not "foreclose the subject" of petitioners\' challenge to the Pennsylvania statutory scheme.  The significant differences between that scheme and the Illinois scheme leave ample "room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised [by petitioners] can be the subject of controversy."  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/512/case.html#518">409 U.

Several elections, including the 1972 presidential election, have been held since this action was filed, but this does not render the case moot.  <em>See Moore v.

In addition to the allegations that they are absolutely prohibited from voting, petitioners allege that the Pennsylvania statute creates classifications based on wealth and race, that the denial of the right to vote is an impermissible consequence of pretrial detention in violation of due process of law, and that the Pennsylvania statute\'s specific exclusion of pretrial detainees from the definition of a "qualified absentee voter" is unconstitutional even under the less stringent rational relationship test applied in <em>McDonald.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals states:  "We have carefully considered each of the contentions raised by the [petitioners], and find them to be without merit."  452 F.2d 39, 41.
