On consideration whereof  it is the opinion of this Court that the petitioner having failed to fulfill the condition of the grant that the said grant or concession is null and void and that the said petitioner has no right or title to the land.  Whereupon it is now here decreed and ordered by this Court that the decree of the said Superior Court in this cause be and the same is hereby reversed and annulled, and that this cause be and the same is hereby remanded to the said Superior Court with directions to enter a decree in conformity to the opinion of this Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
