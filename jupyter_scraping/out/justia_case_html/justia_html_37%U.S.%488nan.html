United States</b></p><p><b>37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 488</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>On an appeal from the Superior Court of East Florida by the United States, the decree of the Court of East Florida was in part affirmed, the title of Sibbald, the appellee, to whom the grant of land had been made by the Spanish governor before the cession of Florida having been deemed valid by the Supreme Court.  The decree of the Supreme Court directed the Surveyor of Public Lands in East Florida to do all things enjoined on him by law in relation to the lands in the surveys made for the grantee.  The case was remanded to the Superior Court of East Florida, for the execution of this decree.  The mandate of the Supreme Court for the execution of the decree of the Supreme Court was directed to the Superior Court of East Florida and the Surveyor of Public Lands would not make the surveys of the lands in the grant according to the decision of the court, the mandate not having been issued to him.  A petition was presented to the Court by Sibbald stating these facts and asking the Court to order that a mandate be made out directing the Surveyor of Public Lands to do all required of him in relation to the surveys of the lands of the grantee in conformity with the decree of the Court, and also to the Superior Court of East Florida, directing the court to cause further to be done therein what of right and according to law and justice and in conformity to the decree of the Court ought to be done.  By the Court</p>\n<p>"Had it appeared that a mandate more special than the one which was"</p>\n<p>sent would have been necessary, it would have been ordered.  The Court is bound to grant a mandate which will suit the case.  The mandate which is annexed to the petition was issued by the clerk, directed only to the court below,</p>\n<p>and no direction is given to the surveyor.  It is therefore, no execution of the final decree of the Supreme Court, and as it remains unexecuted, it is not too late to have it done, and requires no new order or decree in any way modifying that which has been rendered.  The clerk was ordered to make out a certificate of the final decree of the court before rendered, and also a mandate according to such final decree, the opinion of the Court in the case, and on the petition.</p>\n<p>Appellate power is exercised over the proceedings of inferior courts, not on those of the appellate courts.  The superior court has no power to review their decisions, whether in a case at law or equity.  A final decree in chancery is as</p>\n<p>conclusive as a judgment at, law.  Both are conclusive on the rights of the parties thereby adjudicated.  No principle is better settled or of more universal application that no court can reverse or annul its own final decrees or judgments for errors of fact or law after the term in which they have been rendered unless for clerical mistakes or to reinstate a cause dismissed by mistake, from which it follows that no change or modification can be made which may substantially vary or affect it, in any material thing.

Your petitioner further represents that by the opinion and judgment of this Honorable Court he considered two points as clearly settled, to-wit:  first, that he was entitled to the full complement of sixteen thousand acres, according to his original grant.  Secondly, that he had an inherent privilege to direct or point out where other locations should be made in case the survey or surveys made for him was interfered with by older and good claims.  Your petitioner further represents that after said mandate was issued and its execution demanded, it was clearly ascertained that there were divers interferences with older surveys, so as to prevent him from obtaining his full amount of lands unless the deficiency were made up to him by other locations to be pointed out.

The court below confirmed his title to the tract of ten thousand acres, surveyed at the place called for in the grant, but rejected his claim to the two others, surveyed elsewhere, by their final decree, which concluded thus:</p>\n<p>"And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said claimant have leave to survey the whole number of acres called for in his grant at the place designated in the same, provided vacant lands of sufficient extent may be obtained at that place."</p>\n<p>The effect of this decree was to confirm the title to the whole quantity of sixteen thousand acres called for in the grant, if so much could be found vacant at the place called for, but to prohibit the survey of the deficiency at any other than the place designated, whereby the claim was reduced to ten thousand acres.  On an appeal to this Court, the petitioner\'s claim was confirmed to its full extent of sixteen thousand acres, according to the three separate surveys in the record; the decree below was affirmed as to the ten thousand, and reversed as to the two other surveys of four and two thousand acres respectively, and a mandate ordered accordingly.</p>\n<p>In order to ascertain the true intention of the decree of confirmation, and consequently of the mandate, and its effect, that part of the decree below which was affirmed must be taken in connection with the petitioner\'s title and the construction of it by this Court.  Both courts confirmed the title to the whole quantity claimed; the difference between them was as to the two small surveys, which the court below rejected on their construction of the grant; being of opinion that by its terms, the whole quantity must be surveyed in one place.  This Court, construing the grant differently, held that, by its terms, it authorized surveys at places other than the one described, and that after surveying all that was vacant there, the quantity found deficient might be surveyed where the grantee designated.  This was done, as appeared by the evidence; surveys were made by the proper officers, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 37 U. S. 494</a></p><p> and without objections by the Spanish governor.  These were the surveys confirmed by this Court, at the place referred to in the plots in the record.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/35/313/case.html#323">35 U. S. 10</a></span> Pet. 323-324.  There can therefore be no difficulty in understanding the mandate in this respect.  It gives to the surveys of four and two thousand acres, the same validity as if they had been made for the land specified in the grant; as the "equivalent" of what could not be found vacant at the place called for in the grant.  In the decree of the court below, the proviso, if vacant lands of sufficient extent can be obtained at that place, must be referred to the decree of this Court affirming that part of the decree, in conformity with the opinion, as to the "equivalent," for such portion of the whole quantity as was not open to appropriation when the ten thousand acres were surveyed.</p>\n<p>To make up such <em>"equivalent"</em> consistently with the declared opinion of the Court, the party must have the right of filling up his claim in some mode, or he will obtain a less quantity than has been confirmed to him by our final decree, which the law declares shall be final and conclusive between the parties, who were the United States and the petitioner.  3 Story L. 1961.   The latter must therefore have his sixteen thousand acres somewhere.</p>\n<p>By the eleventh section of the act of 1824, provision is made for the case in enacting,</p>\n<p>"That if in any case it should so happen that the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, decreed to any claimant under the provisions of this act, shall have been sold by the United States, or otherwise disposed of, or if the same shall not have been heretofore located, in each and every such case the party may enter the like quantity,"</p>\n<p>&amp;c., 3 Story, 1963.  This section applies to each of the three surveys, provided that either comes within its provisions, by its appearing that any part thereof cannot be obtained pursuant to our decree.  By the sixth section of the same act, the duties to be performed after a final decision in favor of the claimant, are prescribed, the clerk of this Court is to give a copy of the decree under the seal of the Court to the party, who shall deliver it to the surveyor of the state or territory, who shall cause the land to be surveyed and a plot thereof to be made out and returned to the land office, which shall entitle the party to a patent.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This section applies to confirmations, where there is no interfering claim, so that nothing remains to be done by the court below, but when the case comes under the eleventh section, then the surveyor, and the court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 37 U. S. 495</a></p><p> below must both act, the one to ascertain what portion of either of the confirmed survey comes within its provisions, and the other to decide on the return of the surveyor, how much land, if any, is to be entered at the proper land office.  In such cases, the court below acts under our mandate to execute our decree on those matters which remained for their future action; which is to be done in the same manner <em>pro tanto,</em> as when the whole case was originally before it, in the first instance; according to the provisions of the first section of the act, with this exception, that they cannot act on any question of the title of the party to the full quantity confirmed, or decide against the validity of the surveys which have been confirmed by this Court.  So far as our final decree goes, it must be taken to be conclusive.</p>\n<p>On receiving the mandate, the court below must</p>\n<p>"determine all questions arising (in its execution) in relation to the extent, locality, and boundaries of said claim, or other matters connected therewith, fit and proper to be heard and determined, and may, at discretion, order disputed facts to be found by a jury; and otherwise proceed as directed in that section."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  By this reference to the law the meaning of the mandate of this Court directed to the surveyor, commanding him to do and perform the acts enjoined on him by law, and to the court below</p>\n<p>"to cause further to be done therein, what of right, according to law and justice, in conformity to the opinion and decree of this Court, ought to be done [is evident]."</p>\n<p>In <em>Mitchell v. United States,</em> where the Court apprehended that some difficulty might occur, a special mandate was made out on great deliberation.   <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/711/case.html#761">34 U. S. 9</a></span> Pet. 761-762.  In <em>United States v. Soulard,</em> one was made to meet the case,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/35/100/case.html#105">35 U. S. 10</a></span> Pet. 105-106, and had it appeared from the record, in the case between the United States and the petitioner, that a mandate more special than the one made out would have been necessary, it would have been done.  The one ordered is, in substance, the same as those, and with the references now made, will meet the prayer of the petition, which we feel bound to grant for the reasons set forth.  The mandate which is annexed to the petition was issued by the clerk, directed only to the court below, and no direction is given to the surveyor; it is therefore no execution of our final decree, and as it thus remains unexecuted, it is not too late to have it done, and requires no new order or decree </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 37 U. S. 496</a></p><p> in any way modifying that which has been rendered in the reported case.</p>\n<p>It is therefore ordered that the clerk of this Court make out a certificate of the final decree heretofore rendered in the case of <em>United States v. Sibbald,</em> and also a mandate according to such final decree, the opinion of the Court in that case, and on these petitions.</p>\n<p>On consideration of the motion made in this cause by Mr. Clarke, of counsel for the appellant, on a prior day of the present term of this Court, to-wit, on Saturday, 10 February, A.D. 1838, and of the arguments of counsel thereupon had, it is now here considered, ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the clerk of this Court make out a certificate of the final decree heretofore rendered in the case of <em>United States v. Sibbald,</em> and also a mandate according to such final decree, the opinion of the Court in that case and on this petition.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
