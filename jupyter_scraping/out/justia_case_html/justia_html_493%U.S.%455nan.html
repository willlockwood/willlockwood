Seidel,</em> 859 F.2d 1179, 1181-1183 (CA4 1988) (reviewing history of Maryland\'s savings and loan crisis).  Petitioners are nonresidents of Maryland who hold unpaid certificates of deposit issued by Old Court.  Respondents are the former officers and directors of Old Court, the former officers and directors of MSSIC, the law firm of Old Court and MSSIC, the accounting firm of Old Court, and the State of Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund Corp., the state-created successor to MSSIC.  Petitioners allege various state law causes of action as well as claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 48 Stat. 881, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78a <em>et seq.,</em> and RICO.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted respondents\' motions to dismiss, concluding that petitioners had failed to state a claim under the Exchange Act and that, because state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over civil RICO claims, federal abstention was appropriate for the other causes of action because they had been raised in pending litigation in state court.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  865 F.2d 595 (1989).  The Court of Appeals agreed with the district Court that the Old Court certificates of deposit were not "securities" within the meaning of the Exchange Act, <em>see</em> 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78c(a)(10), and that petitioners\' Exchange Act claims were therefore properly dismissed.  865 F.2d at 598-599.

Because we find none of these factors present with respect to civil claims arising under RICO, we hold that state courts retain their presumptive authority to adjudicate such claims.</p>\n<p>At the outset, petitioners concede that there is nothing in the language of RICO -- much less an "explicit statutory directive" -- to suggest that Congress has, by affirmative enactment, divested the state courts of jurisdiction to hear civil RICO claims.  The statutory provision authorizing civil RICO claims provides in full:</p>\n<p>"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter <em>may</em> sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\'s fee."</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1964(c) (emphasis added).

Petitioners nonetheless insist that, if Congress had considered the issue, it would have granted federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over civil RICO claims.  This argument, however, is misplaced, for even if we could reliably discern what Congress\' intent might have been had it considered the question, we are not at liberty to so speculate; the fact that Congress did not even <em>consider</em> the issue readily disposes of any argument that Congress unmistakably intended to divest state courts of concurrent jurisdiction.\n</em></p>\n<p>Sensing this void in the legislative history, petitioners rely, in the alternative, on our decisions in <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

Malley-Duff &amp; Assocs.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/case.html">483 U. S. 143</a></span> (1987), in which we noted that Congress modeled \xc2\xa7 1964(c) after \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15(a).  <em>See Sedima, supra,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/case.html#489">473 U.

Petitioners assert that, because we have interpreted \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the federal courts, <em>see, e.g., General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore &amp; M.S.R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/260/261/case.html">260 U.

S. 286</a></span>-288 (1922), and because Congress may be presumed to have been aware of and incorporated those interpretations when it used similar language in RICO, <em>cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/case.html">441 U.

S. 694</a></span>-699 (1979), Congress intended, by implication, to grant exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims arising under \xc2\xa7 1964(c).</p>\n<p>This argument is also flawed.  To rebut the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction, the question is not whether any intent at all may be divined from legislative silence on the issue, but whether Congress in its deliberations may be said to have affirmatively or unmistakably intended jurisdiction to be exclusively federal.  In the instant case, the lack of any indication in RICO\'s legislative history that Congress either considered or assumed that the importing of remedial language from the Clayton Act into RICO had any jurisdictional implications is dispositive.  The "mere borrowing of statutory language does not imply that Congress also intended to incorporate all of the baggage that may be attached to the borrowed language."  <em>Lou, supra,</em> at 737.  Indeed, to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 493 U. S. 463</a></p><p> extent we impute to Congress knowledge of our Clayton Act precedents, it makes no less sense to impute to Congress knowledge of <em>Claflin</em> and <em>Dowd Box,</em> under which Congress, had it sought to confer exclusive jurisdiction over civil RICO claims, would have had every incentive to do so expressly.</p>\n<p><em>Sedima</em> and <em>Agency Holding</em> are not to the contrary.  Although we observed in <em>Sedima</em> that "[t]he clearest current in [the legislative] history [of \xc2\xa7 1964(c)] is the reliance on the Clayton Act model," 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/case.html#489">473 U. S. 489</a></span>, that statement was made in the context of noting the distinction between "private and governmental actions" under the Clayton Act.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We intimated nothing as to whether Congress\' reliance on the Clayton Act implied any intention to establish exclusive federal jurisdiction for civil RICO claims, and in <em>Sedima</em> itself we <em>rejected</em> any requirement of proving "racketeering injury," noting that to borrow the "antitrust injury" requirement from antitrust law would "creat[e] exactly the problems Congress sought to avoid."  <em>Id.,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/case.html#498">473 U. S. 498</a></span>-499.  Likewise, in <em>Agency Holding</em> we were concerned with "borrowing," in light of legislative silence on the issue, an appropriate statute of limitations period from an "analogous" statute.  483 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/case.html#146">483 U. S. 146</a></span>.  Under such circumstances, we found it appropriate to borrow the statute of limitations from the Clayton Act.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/143/case.html#152">483 U. S. 152</a></span>.  In this case, by contrast, where the issue is whether jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent, we are not free to add content to a statute via analogies to other statutes unless the legislature has specifically endorsed such action.  Under <em>Gulf Offshore,</em> legislative silence counsels, if not compels, us to enforce the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction.  In short, in both <em>Sedima</em> and <em>Agency Holding</em> we looked to the Clayton Act in interpreting RICO without the benefit of a background juridical presumption of the type present in this case.  Thus, to whatever extent the Clayton Act analogy may be relevant to our interpretation of RICO generally, it has no place in our inquiry into the jurisdiction of state courts. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 493 U.

We noted in <em>Gulf Offshore</em> that factors indicating clear incompatibility</p>\n<p>"include the desirability of uniform interpretation, the expertise of federal judges in federal law, and the assumed greater hospitality of federal courts to peculiarly federal claims."</p>\n<p>453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#483">453 U.

S. 465</a></p><p> laws, <em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3231, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] because state courts would be required to construe the federal crimes that constitute predicate acts defined as "racketeering activity," <em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1961(1)(B), (C), and (D).  Petitioners predict that if state courts are permitted to interpret federal criminal statutes, they will create a body of precedent relating to those statutes and that the federal courts will consequently lose control over the orderly and uniform development of federal criminal law.</p>\n<p>We perceive no "clear incompatibility" between state court jurisdiction over civil RICO actions and federal interests.  As a preliminary matter, concurrent jurisdiction over \xc2\xa7 1964(c) suits is clearly not incompatible with \xc2\xa7 3231 itself, for civil RICO claims are not "offenses against the laws of the United States," \xc2\xa7 3231, and do not result in the imposition of criminal sanctions -- uniform or otherwise.  <em>See Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/220/case.html">482 U.

S. 240</a></span>-241 (1987) (civil RICO intended to be primarily remedial rather than punitive).</p>\n<p>More to the point, however, our decision today creates no significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law.  Although petitioners\' concern with the need for uniformity and consistency of federal criminal law is well-taken, <em>see Ableman v. Booth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/62/506/case.html">62 U. S. 506</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/62/506/case.html#517">62 U.

S. 97</a></span> (1948) (vague criminal statutes may violate the Due Process Clause), federal courts, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 3231, would retain full authority and responsibility for the interpretation and application of federal criminal laws, for they would not be bound by state court interpretations of the federal offenses constituting RICO\'s predicate acts.  State courts adjudicating civil RICO claims will, in addition, be guided by federal court interpretations of the relevant federal criminal statutes, just as federal courts sitting in diversity are guided by state court interpretations of state law, <em>see, e.g., Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/456/case.html">387 U.

State court judgments misinterpreting federal criminal law would, of course, also be subject to direct review by this Court.  Thus, we think that state court adjudication of civil RICO actions will, in practice, have at most a negligible effect on the uniform interpretation and application of federal criminal law, <em>cf. Pan-American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court of Delaware, Newcastle County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/656/case.html">366 U.

To hold otherwise would not only denigrate the respect accorded co-equal sovereigns, but would also ignore our "consistent history of hospitable acceptance of concurrent jurisdiction," <em>Dowd Box,</em> 368 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html#508">368 U.

Indeed, it would seem anomalous to rule that state courts are incompetent to adjudicate civil RICO suits when we have recently found no inconsistency in subjecting civil RICO claims to adjudication by arbitration.  <em>See Shearson/American Express,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/220/case.html#239">482 U.

We think it sufficient, however, to observe that we have previously found concurrent state court jurisdiction even where federal law provided for special procedural mechanisms similar to those found in RICO.  <em>See, e.g., Dowd Box, supra,</em> (finding concurrent jurisdiction over Labor Management Relations Act \xc2\xa7 301(a) suits, despite federal enforcement and venue provisions); <em>Maine v.

Although congressional specification </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 493 U. S. 467</a></p><p> of procedural mechanisms applicable only in federal court may tend to suggest that Congress intended exclusive federal jurisdiction, it does not by itself suffice to create a "clear incompatibility" with federal interests.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that, far from disabling or frustrating federal interests, "[p]ermitting state courts to entertain federal causes of action facilitates the enforcement of federal rights."  <em>Gulf Offshore,</em> 453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#478">453 U.

Thus, to the extent that Congress intended RICO to serve broad remedial purposes, <em>see, e.g.,</em> Pub.L. 91-452, \xc2\xa7 904(a), 84 Stat. 947 (RICO must "be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes"); <em>Sedima,</em> 473 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/case.html#492">473 U.

("[I]f Congress\' liberal construction mandate is to be applied anywhere, it is in \xc2\xa7 1964, where RICO\'s remedial purposes are most evident"), concurrent state court jurisdiction over civil RICO claims will advance rather than jeopardize federal policies underlying the statute.</p>\n<p>For all of the above reasons, we hold that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction to consider civil claims arising under RICO.

I add a few words only because this Court has rarely considered contentions that civil actions based on federal criminal statutes must be heard by the federal courts.  As the Court observes <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/455/case.html#465">493 U. S. 465</a></span>, the uniform construction of federal criminal statutes is no insignificant matter, particularly because Congress has recognized potential dangers in disuniform construction and has confined jurisdiction over </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 493 U. S. 468</a></p><p> federal criminal cases to the federal courts.  There is therefore reason for caution before concluding that state courts have jurisdiction over civil claims related to federal criminal statutes and for assessing in each case the danger to federal interests presented by potential inconsistent constructions of federal criminal statutes.</p>\n<p>RICO is an unusual federal criminal statute.  It borrows heavily from state law; racketeering activity is defined in terms of numerous offenses chargeable under state law, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1961(1)(A), as well as various federal offenses.  To the extent that there is any danger under RICO of disuniform construction of criminal statutes, it is quite likely that the damage will result from federal misunderstanding of the content of state law -- a problem, to be sure, but not one to be solved by exclusive federal jurisdiction.  Many of the federal offenses named as racketeering activity under RICO have close, though perhaps not exact, state law analogues, <em>cf. Durland v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/case.html">161 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/case.html#312">161 U. S. 312</a></span> (1896), which construed the federal mail fraud statute, and it is unlikely that the state courts will be incompetent to construe those federal statutes.  Nor does incorrect state court construction of those statutes present as significant a threat to federal interests as that posed by improper interpretation of the federal antitrust laws, which could have a disastrous effect on interstate commerce, a particular concern of the federal government.  Racketeering activity as defined by RICO includes other federal offenses without state law analogues, but given the history as written until now of civil RICO litigation, I doubt that state court construction of these offenses will be greatly disruptive of important federal interests.</p>\n<p>There is also the possibility that the state courts will disrupt the uniform construction of criminal RICO by launching new interpretations of the "pattern" and "enterprise" elements of that offense when hearing civil RICO suits.  This possibility, though not insubstantial, <em>cf.  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/229/case.html">492 U. S. </a></span>J., Inc. v.

S. 229</a></span> (1989), is not enough to require exclusive federal jurisdiction of civil RICO claims.  Even though varying interpretations of the "pattern" and "enterprise" elements of RICO may drastically change the consequences that flow from particular acts, these variations cannot make an act criminal in one court system but blameless in another, and therefore do not implicate the core due process concerns identified by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/455/case.html#464">493 U. S. 464</a></span>, as underlying the need for uniform construction of criminal statutes.

In the standard fields of exclusive federal jurisdiction, the governing statutes specifically recite that suit may be brought "only" in federal court, Investment Company Act of 1940, <em>as amended,</em> 84 Stat. 1429, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 80a-35(b)(5); that the jurisdiction of the federal courts shall be "exclusive," Securities Exchange Act of 1934, <em>as amended,</em> 48 Stat. 902, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78aa; Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 833, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 717u; Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 892, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1132(e)(1); or indeed even that the jurisdiction of the federal courts shall be "exclusive of the courts of the States," 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3231 (criminal cases); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1333 (admiralty, maritime, and prize cases), 1334 (bankruptcy cases), 1338 (patent, plant variety protection, and copyright cases), 1351 (actions against consuls or vice consuls of foreign states), 1355 (actions for recovery or enforcement of fine, penalty, or forfeiture incurred under Act of Congress), 1356 (seizures on land or water not within admiralty and maritime jurisdiction).\n</em></p>\n<p>Assuming, however, that exclusion by implication is possible, surely what is required is implication in the text of the statute, and not merely, as the second part of the <em>Gulf Offshore</em> dictum would permit, through "unmistakable implication </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 493 U. S. 472</a></p><p> from legislative history."  453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#478">453 U. S. 478</a></span>.  Although <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html">368 U. S. 502</a></span> (1962), after concluding that the statute "does not state nor even suggest that [federal] jurisdiction shall be exclusive," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html#506">368 U. S. 506</a></span>, proceeded quite unnecessarily to examine the legislative history, it did so to reinforce rather than contradict the conclusion it had already reached.  We have never found state jurisdiction excluded by "unmistakable implication" from legislative history.  It is perhaps harmless enough to say that it can be, since one can hardly imagine an "implication from legislative history" that is "unmistakable" -- <em>i.e.,</em> that demonstrates agreement to a proposition by a majority of both Houses and the President -- unless the proposition is embodied in statutory text to which those parties have given assent.  But harmless or not, it is simply wrong in principle to assert that Congress can effect this affirmative legislative act by simply talking about it with unmistakable clarity.  What is needed to oust the States of jurisdiction is congressional <em>action</em> (<em>i.e.,</em> a provision of law), not merely congressional discussion.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps also true that implied preclusion can be established by the fact that a statute expressly mentions only federal courts, plus the fact that state court jurisdiction would plainly disrupt the statutory scheme.  That is conceivably what was meant by the third part of the <em>Gulf Offshore</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 493 U. S. 473</a></p><p> dictum, "clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests."  453 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/473/case.html#478">453 U. S. 478</a></span>.  If the phrase is interpreted more broadly than that, however -- if it is taken to assert some power on the part of this Court to exclude state court jurisdiction when systemic federal interests make it undesirable -- it has absolutely no foundation in our precedent.</p>\n<p><em>Gulf Offshore</em> cited three cases to support its "incompatibility" formulation.  The first was <em>Dowd Box, supra,</em> 368 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html#507">368 U. S. 507</a></span>-508, which contains nothing to support any "incompatibility" principle except a quotation from the second case <em>Gulf Offshore</em> cited, <em>Claflin.</em>  Indeed, in response to the argument that "[o]nly the federal judiciary . . . possesses both the familiarity with federal labor legislation and the monolithic judicial system necessary" to elaborate a coherent system of national labor laws, the <em>Dowd Box</em> opinion said:</p>\n<p>"Whatever the merits of this argument as a matter of policy, we find nothing to indicate that Congress adopted such a policy in enacting \xc2\xa7 301."</p>\n<p>368 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/502/case.html#507">368 U. S. 507</a></span>.  The second case cited was <em>Claflin,</em> which said that concurrent jurisdiction exists "where it is not excluded by express provision or by incompatibility in its exercise arising from the nature of the particular case."  93 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html#136">93 U. S. 136</a></span>.  The subsequent discussion makes it entirely clear, however, that what the Court meant by "incompatibility in its exercise arising from the nature of the particular case" was that the particular statute at issue impliedly excluded state court jurisdiction.  "Congress," the Court said, "may, if it sees fit, give to the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction," which it does "sometimes . . . by express enactment and sometimes by implication."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/130/case.html#137">93 U. S. 137</a></span>.  The third case cited, <em>Garner v. Teamsters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/485/case.html">346 U. S. 485</a></span> (1953), had nothing to do with state court jurisdiction over a federal cause of action.  It held that the National Labor Relations Act, whose express provision that the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board shall be exclusive had already been held to prevent <em>federal</em> courts from assuming primary jurisdiction over labor disputes, <em>see Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/41/case.html">303 U. S. 41</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/303/41/case.html#48">303 U. S. 48</a></span> (1938), prevented <em>state</em> courts as well.</p>\n<p>In sum:  As the Court holds, the RICO cause of action meets none of the three tests for exclusion of state court jurisdiction recited in <em>Gulf Offshore.</em>  Since that is so, the proposition that meeting any one of the tests would have sufficed is dictum here, as it was there.  In my view, meeting the second test is assuredly not enough, and meeting the third may not be.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
