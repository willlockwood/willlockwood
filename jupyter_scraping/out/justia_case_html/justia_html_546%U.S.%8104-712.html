S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441 authorizes the removal of civil actions from state court to federal court when the state-court action is one that could have been brought, originally, in federal court.  When federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 diversity of citizenship, see \xc2\xa71332, removal is permissible \xe2\x80\x9conly if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which [the] action [was] brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71441(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Christophe and Juanita Roche, plaintiffs below, respondents here, leased an apartment in a Virginia complex, Westfield Village, managed by Lincoln Property Company (Lincoln).  The Roches commenced suit in state court against diverse defendants, including Lincoln, asserting serious medical ailments from their exposure to toxic mold in their apartment, and alleging loss, theft, or destruction of personal property left in the care of Lincoln and the mold treatment firm during the remediation process.  The Roches identified themselves as Virginia citizens and defendant Lincoln as a Texas corporation.  Defendants removed the litigation to a Federal District Court, invoking that court\xe2\x80\x99s diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  In their consolidated federal-court complaint, the Roches identified themselves and Lincoln just as they did in their state-court complaints.  Lincoln, in its answer, admitted that it managed Westfield Village, and did not seek to avoid liability by asserting that some other entity was responsible for managing the property.  After discovery, the District Court granted defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment, but before judgment was entered, the Roches moved to remand the case to state court.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding the removal improper on the ground that Lincoln failed to show the nonexistence of an affiliated Virginia entity that was a real party in interest.</p>\n<p align="left"> <em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Defendants may remove an action on the basis of diversity of citizenship if there is complete diversity between all named plaintiffs and all named defendants, and no defendant is a citizen of the forum State.  It is not incumbent on the named defendants to negate the existence of a potential defendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Fourth Circuit correctly identified Lincoln as a proper party, but erred in insisting that some other entity affiliated with Lincoln should have been joined as a codefendant, and that it was Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to name that entity and show that its joinder would not destroy diversity.  This Court stresses, first, that the existence of complete diversity between the Roches and Lincoln is plain and no longer subject to debate.  The Court turns next to the reasons why the Fourth Circuit erred in determining that diversity jurisdiction was not proved by the removing parties.  Since <em>Strawbridge</em> v. <em>Curtiss,</em> 3 Cranch 267, this Court has read the statutory formulation \xe2\x80\x9cbetween \xe2\x80\xa6 citizens of different States,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(a)(1), to require complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants.  While \xc2\xa71332 allows plaintiffs to invoke diversity jurisdiction, \xc2\xa71441 gives defendants a corresponding opportunity.  The scales are not evenly balanced, however.  An in-state plaintiff may invoke diversity jurisdiction, but \xc2\xa71441(b) bars removal on the basis of diversity if any \xe2\x80\x9cpart[y] in interest properly joined and served as [a] defendan[t] is a citizen of the State in which [the] action is brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this case, Virginia plaintiffs joined and served no Virginian as a party defendant.  Hence, the action qualified for the removal defendants effected.  Neither Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a), captioned \xe2\x80\x9cReal Party in Interest,\xe2\x80\x9d nor Rule 19, captioned \xe2\x80\x9cJoinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication,\xe2\x80\x9d requires plaintiffs or defendants to name and join any additional parties to this action.  Both Rules address party joinder, not federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit and the Roches draw from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions a jurisdictional \xe2\x80\x9creal parties to the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d rule applicable in diversity cases to complaining and defending parties alike.  But the Court is aware of no decision supporting the burden the Fourth Circuit placed on a properly joined defendant to negate the existence of a potential codefendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions employing \xe2\x80\x9creal party to the controversy\xe2\x80\x9d terminology bear scant resemblance to the Roches\xe2\x80\x99 action.  No party here has been \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly or collusively\xe2\x80\x9d named solely to create federal jurisdiction, see, <em>e.g., </em>28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71359, <em>Kramer</em> v. <em>Caribbean Mills, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/823/index.html">394 U. S. 823</a>, 830.  Nor are cases in which actions against a state agency have been regarded as suits against the State itself, see <em>State Highway Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Wyo.</em> v. <em>Utah Constr. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/278/194/index.html">278 U. S. 194</a>, 199\xe2\x80\x93200, relevant to suits between private parties.  Unlike cases in which a party was named to satisfy state pleading rules, <em>e.g., McNutt ex rel. Leggett, Smith, &amp; Lawrence</em> v. <em>Bland,</em> 2 How. 9, 14, or was joined only as designated performer of a ministerial act, <em>e.g., Walden</em> v. <em>Skinner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/101/577/index.html">101 U. S. 577</a>, 589, or otherwise had no control of, impact, or stake in the controversy, <em>e.g., Wood</em> v. <em>Davis,</em> 18 How. 467, 469\xe2\x80\x93470, Lincoln has a vital interest in this case.  Indeed, Lincoln accepted responsibility, in the event the Roches prevailed on the merits, by admitting that it managed Westfield Village.  In any event, the Fourth Circuit had no warrant in this case to inquire whether some other person might have been joined as an additional or substitute defendant.  Congress, empowered to prescribe the jurisdiction of the federal courts, sometimes has specified that a named party\xe2\x80\x99s own citizenship does not determine its diverse status.  But Congress has not directed that a corporation, for diversity purposes, shall be deemed to have acquired the citizenship of all or any of its affiliates.  For cases like the Roches\xe2\x80\x99, Congress has provided simply and only that \xe2\x80\x9ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71332(c)(1).  The jurisdictional rule governing here is unambiguous and not amenable to judicial enlargement.  Under \xc2\xa71332(c)(1), Lincoln is a citizen of Texas alone, and under \xc2\xa71441(a) and (b), this case was properly removed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71441, which authorizes the removal of civil actions from state court to federal court when the action initiated in state court is one that could have been brought, originally, in a federal district court.  \xc2\xa71441(a).  When federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 diversity of citizenship, see \xc2\xa71332, removal is permissible \xe2\x80\x9conly if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which [the] action [was] brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71441(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Christophe and Juanita Roche, plaintiffs below, respondents here, are citizens of Virginia.  They commenced suit in state court against diverse defendants, including Lincoln Property Company (Lincoln), a corporation chartered and having its principal place of business in Texas.  The defendants removed the litigation to a Federal District Court where, after discovery proceedings, they successfully moved for summary judgment.  Holding the removal improper, the Court of Appeals instructed remand of the action to state court.  373 F.\xc2\xa03d 610, 620\xe2\x80\x93622 (CA4 2004).  The appellate court so ruled on the ground that the Texas defendant failed to show the nonexistence of an affiliated Virginia entity that was the \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 622.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Defendants may remove an action on the basis of diversity of citizenship if there is complete diversity between all named plaintiffs and all named defendants, and no defendant is a citizen of the forum State.  It is not incumbent on the named defendants to negate the existence of a potential defendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Christophe and Juanita Roche leased an apartment in the Westfield Village complex in Fairfax County, Virginia.  About a year after moving in, they discovered evidence of toxic mold in their apartment.  Expert inspection confirmed the presence of mold, which the inspection report linked to hair loss, headaches, irritation of the respiratory tract, fatigue, and dermatitis.  App. 184\xe2\x80\x93190.  The report stated that spores from toxigenic mold species were airborne in the apartment and had likely contaminated the carpeting and fabric surfaces throughout the dwelling.  <em>Id.,</em> at 188.  The Roches moved out of their apartment for the remediation process, leaving their personal belongings in the care of Lincoln, the designated property manager of Westfield Village, and the mold treatment firm.  373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 612.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some months later, the Roches commenced suit, filing two substantially similar complaints in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia.  App. 27\xe2\x80\x9350, 53\xe2\x80\x9375.  Both complaints asserted serious medical ailments from the Roches\xe2\x80\x99 year-long exposure to toxic mold, and sought damages under multiple headings, including negligence, breach of contract, actual fraud, constructive fraud, and violations of Virginia housing regulations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 38\xe2\x80\x9348, 64\xe2\x80\x9374.  In addition, the Roches alleged loss, theft, or destruction of their personal property (including irreplaceable family keepsakes) during the remediation process.  Regarding these losses, they sought damages for conversion and infliction of emotional distress.  <em>Id.,</em> at 49\xe2\x80\x9350, 74\xe2\x80\x9375.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In state court, the Roches\xe2\x80\x99 complaints named three defendants: Lincoln; INVESCO Institutional, an investment management group; and State of Wisconsin Investment Board, the alleged owner of Westfield Village.  <em>Id.,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9328, 52\xe2\x80\x9354.  The complaints described Lincoln as \xe2\x80\x9ca developer and manager of residential communities, including \xe2\x80\xa6 Westfield Village.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 27, 53.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]cting by and through [its] agents,\xe2\x80\x9d the Roches alleged, Lincoln caused the personal injuries of which they complained.  <em>Id.,</em> at 30, 56.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defendants timely removed the twin cases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, invoking that court\xe2\x80\x99s diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(a)(1), 1441(a).  The notice of removal described Lincoln as a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Texas, INVESCO as a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia, and State of Wisconsin Investment Board as an independent agency of Wisconsin.  App. 81.  In their consolidated federal-court complaint, the Roches identified themselves as citizens of Virginia and Lincoln as a corporation headquartered in Texas, just as they did in their state-court complaints.  <em>Id.,</em> at 27, 53, 114\xe2\x80\x93115.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Further, they stated affirmatively that the federal court \xe2\x80\x9chas jurisdiction of this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.  Lincoln, in its answer to the complaint, admitted that, through its regional offices, \xe2\x80\x9cit manages Westfield Village.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 137, 138.  Lincoln did not seek to avoid liability by asserting that some other entity was responsible for managing the property.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In both their state- and federal-court complaints, the Roches stated that, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]pon further discovery in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d they would \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine if additional defendant or defendants will be named.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 28, 54, 116.  Although they engaged in some discovery concerning Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates, their efforts in this regard were not extensive, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, 14, 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 48\xe2\x80\x9349, 53, and at no point did they seek to join any additional defendant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion and denied plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion, noting that it would set forth its reasons in a forthcoming memorandum order.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\xe2\x80\x9321a.  The promised memorandum order issued a few months later, <em>id.,</em> at 22a\xe2\x80\x9340a, and the District Court entered final judgment for the defendants the same day, <em>id.,</em> at 41a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Six days after the District Court granted defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment, but before final judgment was entered, the Roches moved to remand the case to the state court, alleging for the first time the absence of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Specifically, the Roches alleged that Lincoln \xe2\x80\x9cis not a Texas Corporation, but a Partnership with one of its partners residing in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 226.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court denied the remand motion, concluding that Lincoln is a Texas corporation and that removal was proper because the requisite complete diversity existed between all plaintiffs and all defendants.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a\xe2\x80\x9393a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and instructed the District Court to remand the case to the state court.  373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 622.  Although recognizing that Lincoln is a Texas citizen and a proper party to the action, <em>id.</em>, at 620\xe2\x80\x93621, the Court of Appeals observed that \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln operates under many different structures,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 617.  Describing Lincoln as \xe2\x80\x9cthe nominal party and ultimate parent company,\xe2\x80\x9d the appellate court suspected that an unidentified \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, corporation or otherwise, rather than the Texas parent\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cthe real and substantial party in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 620\xe2\x80\x93621.  Lincoln, the party invoking federal-court jurisdiction, had not demonstrated the nonexistence of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Virginia sub-\xe2\x80\x98partnership,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals reasoned, <em>id.</em>, at 621, and therefore had not met its burden of establishing diversity, <em>id.</em>, at 621\xe2\x80\x93622.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1186/index.html">543 U. S. 1186</a> (2005), to resolve a division among the Circuits on the question whether an entity not named or joined as a defendant can nonetheless be deemed a real party in interest whose presence would destroy diversity.

See <em>Navarro Savings Assn.</em> v. <em>Lee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/index.html">446 U.

No party here has been \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly or collusively\xe2\x80\x9d named solely to create federal jurisdiction, see 28 U.

Decisions of this genre are bottomed on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of a State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted Eleventh Amendment right not to be haled into federal court.

Leggett, Smith, &amp; Lawrence</em> v. <em>Bland,</em> 2 How. 9, 14 (1844), or was joined only as designated performer of a ministerial act, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Walden</em> v. <em>Skinner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/101/577/index.html">101 U.

A named defendant who admits involvement in the controversy and would be liable to pay a resulting judgment is not \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d in any sense except that it is named in the complaint.  Cf. <em>Knapp</em> v. <em>Railroad Co.,</em> 20 Wall. 117, 122 (1874).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, we emphasize, the Fourth Circuit had no warrant in this case to inquire whether some other person might have been joined as an additional or substitute defendant.  See <em>id.,</em> at 122 (federal courts should not \xe2\x80\x9cinquir[e] outside of the case in order to ascertain whether some other person may not have an equitable interest in the cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Little,</em> 118 U.

Thus, as a procedural matter, executors, administrators, and guardians \xe2\x80\x9cmay sue in [their] own name[s] without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 17(a).  As to diversity jurisdiction, however, \xc2\xa71332(c)(2) directs that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal representative of [a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s] estate \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the decedent, and the legal representative of an infant or incompetent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the infant or incompetent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress has also provided that in direct action suits against insurers to which the insured is not made a party, the \xe2\x80\x9cinsurer shall be deemed a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen, as well as of any State by which the insurer has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71332(c)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But Congress surely has not directed that a corporation, for diversity-of-citizenship purposes, shall be deemed to have acquired the citizenship of all or any of its affiliates.  For cases of the kind the Roches have instituted, Congress has provided simply and only this instruction: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The jurisdictional rule governing here is unambiguous and it is not amenable to judicial enlargement.  Under \xc2\xa71332(c)(1), Lincoln is a citizen of Texas alone, and under \xc2\xa71441(a) and (b), this case was properly removed.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Roches sued the entity they thought responsible for managing their apartment.

Because no partnership is or need be a party to this action, that question is not live for adjudication.
