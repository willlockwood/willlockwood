The application w as reviewed by several Deputy District Attorneys, and a facially valid search warrant was issued by a state court judge.  Ensuing searches produced large quantities of drugs and other evidence.  Respondents were indicted for federal drug offenses, and filed motions to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted the motions in part, concluding that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause.  Although recognizing that Officer Rombach had acted in good faith, the court rejected the Government\'s suggestion that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should not apply where evidence is seized in reasonable, good faith reliance on a search warrant.

Moreover, reviewing courts will not defer to a warrant based on an affidavit that does not provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.  However, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct, rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.

S. 175</a></span> (1969).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In August, 1981, a confidential informant of unproven reliability informed an officer of the Burbank Police Department that two persons known to him as "Armando" and "Patsy" were selling large quantities of cocaine and methaqualone from their residence at 620 Price Drive in Burbank, Cal.  The informant also indicated that he had witnessed a sale of methaqualone by "Patsy" at the residence approximately five months earlier, and had observed at that time a shoebox containing a large amount of cash that belonged to "Patsy."  He further declared that "Armando" and "Patsy" generally kept only small quantities of drugs at their residence and stored the remainder at another location in Burbank.</p>\n<p>On the basis of this information, the Burbank police initiated an extensive investigation focusing first on the Price Drive residence and later on two other residences as well.  Cars parked at the Price Drive residence were determined to belong to respondents Armando Sanchez, who had previously been arrested for possession of marihuana, and Patsy Stewart, who had no criminal record.  During the course of the investigation, officers observed an automobile belonging to respondent Ricardo Del Castillo, who had previously been arrested for possession of 50 pounds of marihuana, arrive at the Price Drive residence.  The driver of that car entered the house, exited shortly thereafter carrying a small paper sack, and drove away.  A check of Del Castillo\'s probation records led the officers to respondent Alberto Leon, whose telephone number Del Castillo had listed as his employer\'s.  Leon had been arrested in 1980 on drug charges, and a companion had informed the police at that time that Leon was heavily involved in the importation of drugs into this country.  Before the current investigation began, the Burbank officers had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="902">Page 468 U. S. 902</a></p><p> learned that an informant had told a Glendale police officer that Leon stored a large quantity of methaqualone at his residence in Glendale.  During the course of this investigation, the Burbank officers learned that Leon was living at 716 South Sunset Canyon in Burbank.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the officers observed several persons, at least one of whom had prior drug involvement, arriving at the Price Drive residence and leaving with small packages; observed a variety of other material activity at the two residences as well as at a condominium at 7902 Via Magdalena; and witnessed a variety of relevant activity involving respondents\' automobiles.  The officers also observed respondents Sanchez and Stewart board separate flights for Miami.  The pair later returned to Los Angeles together, consented to a search of their luggage that revealed only a small amount of marihuana, and left the airport.  Based on these and other observations summarized in the affidavit, App. 34, Officer Cyril Rombach of the Burbank Police Department, an experienced and well-trained narcotics investigator, prepared an application for a warrant to search 620 Price Drive, 716 South Sunset Canyon, 7902 Via Magdalena, and automobiles registered to each of the respondents for an extensive list of items believed to be related to respondents\' drug trafficking activities.  Officer Rombach\'s extensive application was reviewed by several Deputy District Attorneys.</p>\n<p>A facially valid search warrant was issued in September, 1981, by a State Superior Court Judge.  The ensuing searches produced large quantities of drugs at the Via Magdalena and Sunset Canyon addresses and a small quantity at the Price Drive residence.  Other evidence was discovered at each of the residences and in Stewart\'s and Del Castillo\'s automobiles.  Respondents were indicted by a grand jury in the District Court for the Central District of California and charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and a variety of substantive counts. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="903">Page 468 U. S. 903</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The respondents then filed motions to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The District Court held an evidentiary hearing and, while recognizing that the case was a close one, <em>see id.</em> at 131, granted the motions to suppress in part.  It concluded that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] but did not suppress all of the evidence as to all of the respondents because none of the respondents had standing to challenge all of the searches. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="904">Page 468 U. S. 904</a></p><p> response to a request from the Government, the court made clear that Officer Rombach had acted in good faith, but it rejected the Government\'s suggestion that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should not apply where evidence is seized in reasonable, good faith reliance on a search warrant. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court denied the Government\'s motion for reconsideration, <em>id.</em> at 147, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, judgt. order reported at 701 F.2d 187 (1983).  The Court of Appeals first concluded that Officer Rombach\'s affidavit could not establish probable cause to search the Price Drive residence.  To the extent that the affidavit set forth facts demonstrating the basis of the informant\'s knowledge of criminal activity, the information included was fatally stale.  The affidavit, moreover, failed to establish the informant\'s credibility.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the information provided by the informant was inadequate under both prongs of the two-part test established in <em>Aguilar v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/108/case.html">378 U. S. 108</a></span> (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/410/case.html">393 U. S. 410</a></span> (1969). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The officers\' independent investigation neither cured the staleness nor corroborated the details of the informant\'s declarations.  The Court of Appeals then considered whether the affidavit formed a proper basis for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="905">Page 468 U. S. 905</a></p><p> search of the Sunset Canyon residence.  In its view, the affidavit included no facts indicating the basis for the informants\' statements concerning respondent Leon\'s criminal activities, and was devoid of information establishing the informants\' reliability.  Because these deficiencies had not been cured by the police investigation, the District Court properly suppressed the fruits of the search.  The Court of Appeals refused the Government\'s invitation to recognize a good faith exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.</p>\n<p>The Government\'s petition for certiorari expressly declined to seek review of the lower courts\' determinations that the search warrant was unsupported by probable cause, and presented only the question</p>\n<p>"[w]hether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should be modified so as not to bar the admission of evidence seized in reasonable, good faith reliance on a search warrant that is subsequently held to be defective."</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider the propriety of such a modification.  463 U.S. 1206 (1983).  Although it undoubtedly is within our power to consider the question whether probable cause existed under the "totality of the circumstances" test announced last Term in <em>Illinois v. Gates,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html">462 U. S. 213</a></span> (1983), that question has not been briefed or argued; and it is also within our authority, which we choose to exercise, to take the case as it comes to us, accepting the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that probable cause was lacking under the prevailing legal standards.  <em>See</em> this Court\'s Rule 21. 1(a).</p>\n<p>We have concluded that, in the Fourth Amendment context, the exclusionary rule can be modified somewhat without jeopardizing its ability to perform its intended functions.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Language in opinions of this Court and of individual Justices has sometimes implied that the exclusionary rule is a necessary corollary of the Fourth Amendment, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">Mapp v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="906">Page 468 U.

Proposed extensions of the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than the criminal trial itself have been evaluated and rejected under the same analytic approach.  In <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Even if the warrant application was supported by more than a "bare bones" affidavit, a reviewing court may properly conclude that, notwithstanding the deference that magistrates deserve, the warrant was invalid because the magistrate\'s probable cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the totality of the circumstances, <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#238">462 U. S. 238</a></span>-239, or because the form of the warrant was improper in some respect.</p>\n<p>Only in the first of these three situations, however, has the Court set forth a rationale for suppressing evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant; in the other areas, it has simply excluded such evidence without considering whether </p><p><a class="page-number" name="916">Page 468 U. S. 916</a></p><p> Fourth Amendment interests will be advanced.  To the extent that proponents of exclusion rely on its behavioral effects on judges and magistrates in these areas, their reliance is misplaced.  First, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct, rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.  Second, there exists no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment, or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Third, and most important, we discern no basis, and are offered none, for believing that exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant will have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge or magistrate. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Many of the factors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="917">Page 468 U. S. 917</a></p><p> that indicate that the exclusionary rule cannot provide an effective "special" or "general" deterrent for individual offending law enforcement officers [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] apply as well to judges or magistrates.  And, to the extent that the rule is thought to operate as a "systemic" deterrent on a wider audience, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] it clearly can have no such effect on individuals empowered to issue search warrants.  Judges and magistrates are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team; as neutral judicial officers, they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal prosecutions.  The threat of exclusion thus cannot be expected significantly to deter them.  Imposition of the exclusionary sanction is not necessary meaningfully to inform judicial officers of their errors, and we cannot conclude that admitting evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant while at the same time declaring that the warrant was somehow defective will in any way reduce judicial officers\' professional incentives to comply with the Fourth Amendment, encourage them to repeat their mistakes, or lead to the granting of all colorable warrant requests. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="918">Page 468 U. S. 918</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>If exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect, therefore, it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments.  One could argue that applying the exclusionary rule in cases where the police failed to demonstrate probable cause in the warrant application deters future inadequate presentations or "magistrate shopping," and thus promotes the ends of the Fourth Amendment.  Suppressing evidence obtained pursuant to a technically defective warrant supported by probable cause also might encourage officers to scrutinize more closely the form of the warrant, and to point out suspected judicial errors.  We find such arguments speculative, and conclude that suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis, and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.

It is the magistrate\'s responsibility to determine whether the officer\'s allegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.

We do not suggest, however, that exclusion is always inappropriate in cases where an officer has obtained a warrant and abided by its terms.  "[S]earches pursuant to a warrant will rarely require any deep inquiry into reasonableness," <em>Illinois v. Gates,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#267">462 U.

S. 823</a></span>, n. 32 (1982).  Nevertheless, the officer\'s reliance on the magistrate\'s probable cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively reasonable, <em>cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/case.html">457 U.

S. 923</a></p><p> the officer [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued.</p>\n<p>Suppression therefore remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.  <em>Franks v. Delaware,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/154/case.html">438 U. S. 154</a></span> (1978).

Nor would an officer manifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit "so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable."  <em>Brown v.

Finally, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient -- <em>i.e.,</em> in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized -- that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  <em>Cf. Massachusetts v. Sheppard, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/case.html#988">468 U. S. 988</a></span>-991.</p>\n<p>In so limiting the suppression remedy, we leave untouched the probable cause standard and the various requirements for a valid warrant.  Other objections to the modification of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="924">Page 468 U. S. 924</a></p><p> the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule we consider to be insubstantial.  The good faith exception for searches conducted pursuant to warrants is not intended to signal our unwillingness strictly to enforce the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, and we do not believe that it will have this effect.  As we have already suggested, the good faith exception, turning as it does on objective reasonableness, should not be difficult to apply in practice.  When officers have acted pursuant to a warrant, the prosecution should ordinarily be able to establish objective good faith without a substantial expenditure of judicial time.</p>\n<p>Nor are we persuaded that application of a good faith exception to searches conducted pursuant to warrants will preclude review of the constitutionality of the search or seizure, deny needed guidance from the courts, or freeze Fourth Amendment law in its present state. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  There is no need for courts to adopt the inflexible practice of always deciding whether the officers\' conduct manifested objective good faith before turning to the question whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated.  Defendants seeking suppression of the fruits of allegedly unconstitutional searches or seizures undoubtedly raise live controversies which Art. III empowers federal courts to adjudicate.  As cases addressing questions of good faith immunity under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, compare <em>O\'Connor v. Donaldson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/563/case.html">422 U. S. 563</a></span> (1975), <em>with Procunier v.

S. 925</a></p><p> discretion in conforming their decisionmaking processes to the exigencies of particular cases.</p>\n<p>If the resolution of a particular Fourth Amendment question is necessary to guide future action by law enforcement officers and magistrates, nothing will prevent reviewing courts from deciding that question before turning to the good faith issue. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Indeed, it frequently will be difficult to determine whether the officers acted reasonably without resolving the Fourth Amendment issue.  Even if the Fourth Amendment question is not one of broad import, reviewing courts could decide in particular cases that magistrates under their supervision need to be informed of their errors, and so evaluate the officers\' good faith only after finding a violation.  In other circumstances, those courts could reject suppression motions posing no important Fourth Amendment questions by turning immediately to a consideration of the officers\' good faith.  We have no reason to believe that our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would suffer by allowing reviewing courts to exercise an informed discretion in making this choice.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>When the principles we have enunciated today are applied to the facts of this case, it is apparent that the judgment of the Court of Appeals cannot stand.  The Court of Appeals applied the prevailing legal standards to Officer Rombach\'s warrant application, and concluded that the application could not support the magistrate\'s probable cause determination.  In so doing, the court clearly informed the magistrate that he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="926">Page 468 U. S. 926</a></p><p> had erred in issuing the challenged warrant.  This aspect of the court\'s judgment is not under attack in this proceeding.</p>\n<p>Having determined that the warrant should not have issued, the Court of Appeals understandably declined to adopt a modification of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule that this Court had not previously sanctioned.  Although the modification finds strong support in our previous cases, the Court of Appeals\' commendable self-restraint is not to be criticized.  We have now reexamined the purposes of the exclusionary rule and the propriety of its application in cases where officers have relied on a subsequently invalidated search warrant.  Our conclusion is that the rule\'s purposes will only rarely be served by applying it in such circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the absence of an allegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.  Only respondent Leon has contended that no reasonably well trained police officer could have believed that there existed probable cause to search his house; significantly, the other respondents advance no comparable argument.  Officer Rombach\'s application for a warrant clearly was supported by much more than a "bare bones" affidavit.  The affidavit related the results of an extensive investigation and, as the opinions of the divided panel of the Court of Appeals make clear, provided evidence sufficient to create disagreement among thoughtful and competent judges as to the existence of probable cause.  Under these circumstances, the officers\' reliance on the magistrate\'s determination of probable cause was objectively reasonable, and application of the extreme sanction of exclusion is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="927">Page 468 U.

As Professor Jerold Israel has observed:</p>\n<p>"The key to the [exclusionary] rule\'s effectiveness as a deterrent lies, I believe, in the impetus it has provided to police training programs that make officers aware of the limits imposed by the fourth amendment and emphasize the need to operate within those limits.  [An objective good faith exception] is not likely to result in the elimination of such programs, which are now viewed as an important aspect of police professionalism.  Neither is it likely to alter the tenor of those programs; the possibility that illegally obtained evidence may be admitted in borderline cases is unlikely to encourage police instructors to pay less attention to fourth amendment limitations.  Finally, [it] should not encourage officers to pay less attention to what they are taught, as the requirement that the officer act in \'good faith\' is inconsistent with closing one\'s mind to the possibility of illegality."</p>\n<p>Israel, <em>supra,</em> n. 14, at 1412-1413 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>According to the Attorney General\'s Task Force on Violent Crime, Final Report (1981), the situation in which an officer relies on a duly authorized warrant</p>\n<p>"is a particularly compelling example of good faith.  A warrant is a judicial mandate to an officer to conduct a search or make an arrest, and the officer has a sworn duty to carry out its provisions.

Accordingly, our good faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate\'s authorization.  In making this determination, all of the circumstances -- including whether the warrant application had previously been rejected by a different magistrate -- may be considered.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>References to "officer" throughout this opinion should not be read too narrowly.  It is necessary to consider the objective reasonableness not only of the officers who eventually executed a warrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who provided information material to the probable cause determination.  Nothing in our opinion suggests, for example, that an officer could obtain a warrant on the basis of a "bare bones" affidavit and then rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under which the warrant was obtained to conduct the search.  <em>See Whiteley v.

In so doing, the Court writes another chapter in the volume of Fourth Amendment law opened by <em>Weeks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html">232 U. S. 383</a></span> (1914).  I join the Court\'s opinion in this case and the one in <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/case.html">468 U. S. 981</a></span>, because I believe that the rule announced today advances the legitimate interests of the criminal justice system without sacrificing the individual rights protected by the Fourth Amendment.  I write separately, however, to underscore what I regard as the unavoidably provisional nature of today\'s decisions.</p>\n<p>As the Court\'s opinion in this case makes clear, the Court has narrowed the scope of the exclusionary rule because of an empirical judgment that the rule has little appreciable effect in cases where officers act in objectively reasonable reliance on search warrants.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#918">468 U. S. 918</a></span>-921.  Because I share the view that the exclusionary rule is not a constitutionally compelled corollary of the Fourth Amendment itself, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#905">468 U. S. 905</a></span>-906, I see no way to avoid making an empirical judgment of this sort, and I am satisfied that the Court has made the correct one on the information before it.  Like all courts, we face institutional limitations on our ability to gather information about "legislative facts," and the exclusionary rule itself has exacerbated the shortage of hard data concerning the behavior of police officers in the absence of such a rule.  <em>See United States v. Janis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html">428 U. S. 433</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html#448">428 U. S. 448</a></span>-453 (1976).  Nonetheless, we cannot escape the responsibility to decide the question before us, however imperfect our information may be, and I am prepared to join the Court on the information now at hand. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="928">Page 468 U. S. 928</a></p><p></p>\n<p>What must be stressed, however, is that any empirical judgment about the effect of the exclusionary rule in a particular class of cases necessarily is a provisional one.  By their very nature, the assumptions on which we proceed today cannot be cast in stone.  To the contrary, they now will be tested in the real world of state and federal law enforcement, and this Court will attend to the results.  If it should emerge from experience that, contrary to our expectations, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule results in a material change in police compliance with the Fourth Amendment, we shall have to reconsider what we have undertaken here.  The logic of a decision that rests on untested predictions about police conduct demands no less.</p>\n<p>If a single principle may be drawn from this Court\'s exclusionary rule decisions, from <em>Weeks</em> through <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961), to the decisions handed down today, it is that the scope of the exclusionary rule is subject to change in light of changing judicial understanding about the effects of the rule outside the confines of the courtroom.  It is incumbent on the Nation\'s law enforcement officers, who must continue to observe the Fourth Amendment in the wake of today\'s decisions, to recognize the double-edged nature of that principle.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Ten years ago, in <em>United States v. Calandra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html">414 U. S. 338</a></span> (1974), I expressed the fear that the Court\'s decision</p>\n<p>"may signal that a majority of my colleagues have positioned themselves to reopen the door [to evidence secured by official lawlessness] still further and abandon altogether the exclusionary rule in search and seizure cases."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#365">414 U. S. 365</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  Since then, in case after case, I have witnessed the Court\'s gradual but determined strangulation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="929">Page 468 U. S. 929</a></p><p> of the rule. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  It now appears that the Court\'s victory over the Fourth Amendment is complete.  That today\'s decisions represent the <em>piece de resistance</em> of the Court\'s past efforts cannot be doubted, for today the Court sanctions the use in the prosecution\'s case in chief of illegally obtained evidence against the individual whose rights have been violated -- a result that had previously been thought to be foreclosed.</p>\n<p>The Court seeks to justify this result on the ground that the "costs" of adhering to the exclusionary rule in cases like those before us exceed the "benefits."  But the language of deterrence and of cost/benefit analysis, if used indiscriminately, can have a narcotic effect.  It creates an illusion of technical precision and ineluctability.  It suggests that not only constitutional principle but also empirical data support the majority\'s result.  When the Court\'s analysis is examined carefully, however, it is clear that we have not been treated to an honest assessment of the merits of the exclusionary rule, but have instead been drawn into a curious world where the "costs" of excluding illegally obtained evidence loom to exaggerated heights, and where the "benefits" of such exclusion are made to disappear with a mere wave of the hand.</p>\n<p>The majority ignores the fundamental constitutional importance of what is at stake here.  While the machinery of law enforcement, and indeed the nature of crime itself, have changed dramatically since the Fourth Amendment became part of the Nation\'s fundamental law in 1791, what the Framers understood then remains true today -- that the task of combating crime and convicting the guilty will in every era seem of such critical and pressing concern that we may be lured by the temptations of expediency into forsaking our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="930">Page 468 U. S. 930</a></p><p> commitment to protecting individual liberty and privacy.  It was for that very reason that the Framers of the Bill of Rights insisted that law enforcement efforts be permanently and unambiguously restricted in order to preserve personal freedoms.  In the constitutional scheme they ordained, the sometimes unpopular task of ensuring that the government\'s enforcement efforts remain within the strict boundaries fixed by the Fourth Amendment was entrusted to the courts.  As James Madison predicted in his address to the First Congress on June 8, 1789:</p>\n<p>"If [these rights] are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights."</p>\n<p>1 Annals of Cong. 439.  If those independent tribunals lose their resolve, however, as the Court has done today, and give way to the seductive call of expediency, the vital guarantees of the Fourth Amendment are reduced to nothing more than a "form of words."  <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v.

But even if I were to accept the Court\'s chosen method of analyzing the question posed by these cases, I would still conclude that the Court\'s decision cannot be justified.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court holds that physical evidence seized by police officers reasonably relying upon a warrant issued by a detached </p><p><a class="page-number" name="931">Page 468 U.

I have no doubt that these decisions will prove in time to have been a grave mistake.  But, as troubling and important as today\'s new doctrine may be for the administration of criminal justice in this country, the mode of analysis used to generate that doctrine also requires critical examination, for it may prove in the long run to pose the greater threat to our civil liberties.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>At bottom, the Court\'s decision turns on the proposition that the exclusionary rule is merely a</p>\n<p>"\'judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">468 U.

The germ of that idea is found in <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html">338 U. S. 25</a></span> (1949), and although I had thought that such a narrow conception of the rule had been forever put to rest by our decision in <em>Mapp v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961), it has been revived by the present Court and reaches full flower with today\'s decision.  The essence of this view, as expressed initially in the <em>Calandra</em> opinion and as reiterated today, is that the sole</p>\n<p>"purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent unreasonable governmental intrusions into the privacy of one\'s person, house, papers, or effects.  The wrong condemned is the unjustified governmental invasion of these areas of an individual\'s life.  That wrong . . . is <em>fully accomplished</em> by the original search without probable cause."</p>\n<p>414 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#354">414 U. S. 354</a></span> (emphasis added); <em>see also ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">468 U. S. 906</span>.  This reading of the Amendment implies that its proscriptions are directed solely at those government agents who may actually invade an individual\'s constitutionally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="932">Page 468 U. S. 932</a></p><p> protected privacy.  The courts are not subject to any direct constitutional duty to exclude illegally obtained evidence, because the question of the admissibility of such evidence is not addressed by the Amendment.  This view of the scope of the Amendment relegates the judiciary to the periphery.  Because the only constitutionally cognizable injury has already been "fully accomplished" by the police by the time a case comes before the courts, the Constitution is not itself violated if the judge decides to admit the tainted evidence.  Indeed, the most the judge can do is wring his hands and hope that perhaps, by excluding such evidence, he can deter future transgressions by the police.</p>\n<p>Such a reading appears plausible, because, as critics of the exclusionary rule never tire of repeating, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] the Fourth Amendment makes no express provision for the exclusion of evidence secured in violation of its commands.  A short answer to this claim, of course, is that many of the Constitution\'s most vital imperatives are stated in general terms, and the task of giving meaning to these precepts is therefore left to subsequent judicial decisionmaking in the context of concrete cases.  The nature of our Constitution, as Chief Justice Marshall long ago explained,</p>\n<p>"requires that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html">McCulloch v. Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html#407">17 U. S. 407</a></span> (1819).</p>\n<p>A more direct answer may be supplied by recognizing that the Amendment, like other provisions of the Bill of Rights, restrains the power of the government as a whole; it does not specify only a particular agency and exempt all others.  The judiciary is responsible, no less than the executive, for ensuring that constitutional rights are respected. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="933">Page 468 U. S. 933</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When that fact is kept in mind, the role of the courts and their possible involvement in the concerns of the Fourth Amendment comes into sharper focus.  Because seizures are executed principally to secure evidence, and because such evidence generally has utility in our legal system only in the context of a trial supervised by a judge, it is apparent that the admission of illegally obtained evidence implicates the same constitutional concerns as the initial seizure of that evidence.  Indeed, by admitting unlawfully seized evidence, the judiciary becomes a part of what is, in fact, a single governmental action prohibited by the terms of the Amendment. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Once that connection between the evidence-gathering role of the police and the evidence-admitting function of the courts is acknowledged, the plausibility of the Court\'s interpretation becomes more suspect.  Certainly nothing in the language or history of the Fourth Amendment suggests that a recognition of this evidentiary link between the police and the courts was meant to be foreclosed. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  It is difficult to give any meaning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="934">Page 468 U. S. 934</a></p><p> at all to the limitations imposed by the Amendment if they are read to proscribe only certain conduct by the police, but to allow other agents of the same government to take advantage of evidence secured by the police in violation of its requirements. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  The Amendment therefore must be read to condemn not only the initial unconstitutional invasion of privacy -- which is done, after all, for the purpose of securing evidence -- but also the subsequent use of any evidence so obtained. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="935">Page 468 U. S. 935</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court evades this principle by drawing an artificial line between the constitutional rights and responsibilities that are engaged by actions of the police and those that are engaged when a defendant appears before the courts.  According to the Court, the substantive protections of the Fourth Amendment are wholly exhausted at the moment when police unlawfully invade an individual\'s privacy, and thus no substantive force remains to those protections at the time of trial when the government seeks to use evidence obtained by the police.</p>\n<p>I submit that such a crabbed reading of the Fourth Amendment casts aside the teaching of those Justices who first formulated the exclusionary rule, and rests ultimately on an impoverished understanding of judicial responsibility in our constitutional scheme.  For my part, "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures" comprises a personal right to exclude all evidence secured by means of unreasonable searches and seizures.  The right to be free from the initial invasion of privacy and the right of exclusion are coordinate components of the central embracing right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p>Such a conception of the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment was unquestionably the original basis of what has come to be called the exclusionary rule when it was first formulated in <em>Weeks v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html">232 U. S. 383</a></span> (1914).  There the Court considered whether evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment by a United States Marshal could be admitted at trial after the defendant had moved that the evidence be returned.  Significantly, although the Court considered the Marshal\'s initial invasion of the defendant\'s home to be unlawful, it went on to consider a question that</p>\n<p>"involves the right of the court in a criminal prosecution to retain for the purposes of evidence the letters and correspondence of the accused, seized in his house in his absence without his authority, by a United States Marshal holding no </p><p><a class="page-number" name="936">Page 468 U. S. 936</a></p><p> warrant for . . . the search of his premises."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#393">232 U. S. 393</a></span>.  In answering that question, Justice Day, speaking for a unanimous Court, expressly recognized that the commands of the Fourth Amendment were addressed to both the courts and the Executive Branch:</p>\n<p>"The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the people, their persons, houses, papers and effects against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law.  This protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not, and <em>the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws.</em>  The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures . . . should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts, which are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#391">232 U. S. 391</a></span>-392.</p>\n<p>The heart of the <em>Weeks</em> opinion, and for me the beginning of wisdom about the Fourth Amendment\'s proper meaning, is found in the following passage:</p>\n<p>"If letters and private documents can . . . be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.  The efforts of the courts and [federal] officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great </p><p><a class="page-number" name="937">Page 468 U. S. 937</a></p><p> principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.  The United States Marshal could only have invaded the house of the accused when armed with a warrant issued as required by the Constitution. . . .  Instead, he acted without sanction of law, doubtless prompted by the desire to bring further proof to the aid of the Government, and, under color of his office, undertook to make a seizure of private papers in direct violation of the constitutional prohibition against such action. . . .  To sanction such proceedings would be to affirm by judicial decision a manifest neglect, if not an open defiance, of the prohibitions of the Constitution intended for the protection of the people against such unauthorized action."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#393">232 U. S. 393</a></span>-394.</p>\n<p>What this passage succinctly captures is the essential recognition, ignored by the present Court, that seizures are generally executed for the purpose of bringing "proof to the aid of the Government," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/case.html#393">232 U. S. 393</a></span>, that the utility of such evidence in a criminal prosecution arises ultimately in the context of the courts, and that the courts therefore cannot be absolved of responsibility for the means by which evidence is obtained.  As the Court in <em>Weeks</em> clearly recognized, the obligations cast upon government by the Fourth Amendment are not confined merely to the police.  In the words of Justice Holmes:</p>\n<p>"If the search and seizure are unlawful as invading personal rights secured by the Constitution, those rights would be infringed yet further if the evidence were allowed to be used."</p>\n<p><em>Dodge v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/530/case.html">272 U. S. 530</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/21/case.html#32">272 U. S. 32</a></span> (1926).  As the Court further explained in <em>Olmstead v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html">277 U. S. 438</a></span> (1928):</p>\n<p>"The striking outcome of the <em>Weeks</em> case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction if obtained by government officers through a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="938">Page 468 U. S. 938</a></p><p> violation of the Amendment.  Theretofore, many had supposed, under the ordinary common law rules, if the tendered evidence was pertinent, the method of obtaining it was unimportant. . . .  But in the <em>Weeks</em> case and those which followed, this Court decided with great emphasis, and established as the law for the federal courts, that the protection of the Fourth Amendment would be much impaired unless it was held that not only was the official violator of the rights under the Amendment subject to an action at the suit of the injured defendant, but also that the evidence thereby obtained could not be received."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/438/case.html#462">277 U. S. 462</a></span>-463.</p>\n<p>That conception of the rule, in my view, is more faithful to the meaning and purpose of the Fourth Amendment and to the judiciary\'s role as the guardian of the people\'s constitutional liberties.  In contrast to the present Court\'s restrictive reading, the Court in <em>Weeks</em> recognized that, if the Amendment is to have any meaning, police and the courts cannot be regarded as constitutional strangers to each other; because the evidence-gathering role of the police is directly linked to the evidence-admitting function of the courts, an individual\'s Fourth Amendment rights may be undermined as completely by one as by the other.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>From the foregoing, it is clear why the question whether the exclusion of evidence would deter future police misconduct was never considered a relevant concern in the early cases from <em>Weeks</em> to <em>Olmstead.</em> [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In those formative decisions, the Court plainly understood that the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence was compelled not by judicially fashioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="939">Page 468 U. S. 939</a></p><p> remedial purposes, but rather by a direct constitutional command.  A new phase in the history of the rule, however, opened with the Court\'s decision in <em>Wolf v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html">338 U. S. 25</a></span> (1949).  Although that decision held that the security of one\'s person and privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment was "implicit in <em>the concept of ordered liberty\' and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause" of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html#27">338 U.

S. 325</a></span> (1937), the Court went on, in what can only be regarded as a <em>tour de force</em> of constitutional obfuscation, to say that the "ways of enforcing such a basic right raise questions of a different order," 338 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html#28">338 U. S. 28</a></span>.  Notwithstanding the force of the <em>Weeks</em> doctrine that the Fourth Amendment required exclusion, a state court was free to admit illegally seized evidence, according to the Court in <em>Wolf,</em> so long as the State had devised some other "effective" means of vindicating a defendant\'s Fourth Amendment rights.  338 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/case.html#31">338 U.

S. 643</a></span> (1961), however, the Court restored the original understanding of the <em>Weeks</em> case by overruling the holding of <em>Wolf</em> and repudiating its rationale.  Although, in the course of reaching this conclusion, the Court in <em>Mapp</em> responded at certain points to the question, first raised in <em>Wolf,</em> of whether the exclusionary rule was an "effective" remedy compared to alternative means of enforcing the right, <em>see</em> 367 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#651">367 U. S. 651</a></span>-653, it nevertheless expressly held that</p>\n<p>"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, <em>by that same authority,</em> inadmissible in a state court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#655">367 U. S. 655</a></span> (emphasis added).  In the Court\'s view, the exclusionary rule was not one among a range of options to be selected at the discretion of judges; it was "an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#657">367 U. S. 657</a></span>.  Rejection of the <em>Wolf</em> approach was constitutionally required, the Court explained, because</p>\n<p>"the admission of the new constitutional right by <em>Wolf</em> could not consistently tolerate denial of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="940">Page 468 U. S. 940</a></p><p> its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment."</p>\n<p>367 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#656">367 U. S. 656</a></span>.  Indeed, no other explanation suffices to account for the Court\'s holding in Mapp, since the only possible predicate for the Court\'s conclusion that the States were bound by the Fourteenth Amendment to honor the <em>Weeks</em> doctrine is that the exclusionary rule was "part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment\'s limitation upon [governmental] encroachment of individual privacy."  367 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/case.html#651">367 U. S. 651</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Despite this clear pronouncement, however, the Court since <em>Calandra</em> has gradually pressed the deterrence rationale for the rule back to center stage.  <em>See, e.g., United States v. Peltier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html">422 U. S. 531</a></span> (1975); <em>United States v. Janis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html">428 U. S. 433</a></span> (1976); <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a></span> (1976).  The various arguments advanced by the Court in this campaign have only strengthened my conviction that the deterrence theory is both misguided and unworkable.  First, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="941">Page 468 U. S. 941</a></p><p> the Court has frequently bewailed the "cost" of excluding reliable evidence.  In large part, this criticism rests upon a refusal to acknowledge the function of the Fourth Amendment itself.  If nothing else, the Amendment plainly operates to disable the government from gathering information and securing evidence in certain ways.  In practical terms, of course, this restriction of official power means that some incriminating evidence inevitably will go undetected if the government obeys these constitutional restraints.  It is the loss of that evidence that is the "price" our society pays for enjoying the freedom and privacy safeguarded by the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, some criminals will go free not, in Justice (then Judge) Cardozo\'s misleading epigram, "because the constable has blundered," <em>People v. Defore,</em> 242 N.Y. 13, 21, 150 N.E. 585, 587 (1926), but rather because official compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements makes it more difficult to catch criminals.  Understood in this way, the Amendment directly contemplates that some reliable and incriminating evidence will be lost to the government; therefore, it is not the exclusionary rule, but the Amendment itself, that has imposed this cost. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="942">Page 468 U. S. 942</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In addition, the Court\'s decisions over the past decade have made plain that the entire enterprise of attempting to assess the benefits and costs of the exclusionary rule in various contexts is a virtually impossible task for the judiciary to perform honestly or accurately.  Although the Court\'s language in those cases suggests that some specific empirical basis may support its analyses, the reality is that the Court\'s opinions represent inherently unstable compounds of intuition, hunches, and occasional pieces of partial and often inconclusive data.  In <em>Calandra,</em> for example, the Court, in considering whether the exclusionary rule should apply in grand jury proceedings, had before it no concrete evidence whatever concerning the impact that application of the rule in such proceedings would have either in terms of the long-term costs or the expected benefits.  To the extent empirical data are available regarding the general costs and benefits of the exclusionary rule, such data have shown, on the one hand, as the Court acknowledges today, that the costs are not as substantial as critics have asserted in the past, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#907">468 U. S. 907</a></span>-908, n. 6, and, on the other hand, that, while the exclusionary rule may well have certain deterrent effects, it is extremely difficult to determine with any degree of precision whether the incidence of unlawful conduct by police is now lower than it was prior to <em>Mapp.</em> <em>See United States v. Janis,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html#449">428 U. S. 449</a></span>-453, and n. 22; <em>Stone v. Powell,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#492">428 U. S. 492</a></span>, n. 32. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="943">Page 468 U. S. 943</a></p><p> Court has sought to turn this uncertainty to its advantage by casting the burden of proof upon proponents of the rule, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Janis, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/433/case.html#453">428 U. S. 453</a></span>-454.  "Obviously," however,</p>\n<p>"the assignment of the burden of proof on an issue where evidence does not exist and cannot be obtained is outcome-determinative.  [The] assignment of the burden is merely a way of announcing a predetermined conclusion. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]"</p>\n<p>By remaining within its redoubt of empiricism and by basing the rule solely on the deterrence rationale, the Court has robbed the rule of legitimacy.  A doctrine that is explained as if it were an empirical proposition, but for which there is only limited empirical support, is both inherently unstable and an easy mark for critics.  The extent of this Court\'s fidelity to Fourth Amendment requirements, however, should not turn on such statistical uncertainties.  I share the view, expressed by Justice Stewart for the Court in <em>Faretta v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/case.html">422 U. S. 806</a></span> (1975), that "[p]ersonal liberties are not rooted in the law of averages."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/case.html#834">422 U. S. 834</a></span>.  Rather than seeking to give effect to the liberties secured by the Fourth Amendment through guesswork about deterrence, the Court should restore to its proper place the principle framed 70 years ago in <em>Weeks</em> that an individual whose privacy has been invaded in violation of the Fourth Amendment has a right grounded in that Amendment to prevent the government from subsequently making use of any evidence so obtained. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="944">Page 468 U. S. 944</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Application of that principle clearly requires affirmance in the two cases decided today.  In the first, <em>United States v. Leon,</em> No. 82-1771, it is conceded by the Government and accepted by the Court that the affidavit filed by the police officers in support of their application for a search warrant failed to provide a sufficient basis on which a neutral and detached magistrate could conclude that there was probable cause to issue the warrant.  Specifically, it is conceded that the officers\' application for a warrant was based in part on information supplied by a confidential informant of unproven reliability that was over five months old by the time it was relayed to the police.  Although the police conducted an independent investigation on the basis of this tip, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that the additional information gathered by the officers failed to corroborate the details of the informant\'s tip, and was "as consistent with innocence as . . . with guilt."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a.  The warrant, therefore, should never have issued.  Stripped of the authority of the warrant, the conduct of these officers was plainly unconstitutional -- it amounted to nothing less than a naked invasion of the privacy of respondents\' homes without the requisite justification demanded by the Fourth Amendment.  In order to restore the Government to the position it would have occupied had this unconstitutional search not occurred, therefore, it was necessary that the evidence be suppressed.  As we said in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/443/case.html">403 U. S. 443</a></span> (1971), the Warrant Clause is not</p>\n<p>"an inconvenience to be somehow \'weighed\' against the claims of police efficiency.

S. 945</a></p><p> The warrant had authorized a search for cocaine, methaqualone tablets, and miscellaneous narcotics paraphernalia at several locations:  a condominium at 7902 Via Magdalena in Los Angeles; a residence at 620 Price Drive in Burbank; a residence at 716 South Sunset Canyon in Burbank; and four automobiles owned respectively by respondents Leon, Sanchez, Stewart, and Del Castillo.  App. 31-33.  Pursuant to this warrant, the officers seized approximately four pounds of cocaine and over 1,000 methaqualone tablets from the Via Magdalena condominium, nearly one pound of cocaine from the Sunset Canyon residence, about an ounce of cocaine from the Price Drive residence, and certain paraphernalia from Del Castillo\'s and Stewart\'s automobiles.  On the basis of this and other evidence, the four respondents were charged with violating 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 846 for conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine, and \xc2\xa7 841(a)(1) for possessing methaqualone and cocaine with intent to distribute.  The indictment specifically alleged that respondents had maintained the Via Magdalena condominium as a storage area for controlled substances which they distributed to prospective purchasers.  App. 27-28.</p>\n<p>At the suppression hearing, the District Court determined that none of the respondents had a sufficient expectation of privacy to contest the search of the Via Magdalena condominium, that respondents Stewart and Sanchez could challenge the search of their home at Price Drive, that respondent Leon was entitled to challenge the search of his home at Sunset Canyon, and that respondents Del Castillo and Stewart could contest the search of their cars.  Given its finding that probable cause to issue the warrant was lacking, the District Court ruled that the evidence from the Price Drive residence could not be used against respondents Stewart and Sanchez, that evidence from the Sunset Canyon residence could not be used against Leon, and that evidence obtained from both Del Castillo\'s and Stewart\'s automobiles could not be used against them.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a-13a. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="946">Page 468 U. S. 946</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The tenor of the Court\'s opinion suggests that this order somehow imposed a grave and presumably unjustifiable cost on society.  Such a suggestion, however, is a gross exaggeration.  Since the indictment focused upon a conspiracy among all respondents to use the Via Magdalena condominium as a storage area for controlled substances, and since the bulk of the evidence seized was from that condominium and was plainly admissible under the District Court\'s order, the Government would clearly still be able to present a strong case to the jury following the court\'s suppression order.  I emphasize these details not to suggest how the Government\'s case would fare before the jury, but rather to clarify a point that is lost in the Court\'s rhetorical excesses over the costs of the exclusionary rule -- namely, that the suppression of evidence will certainly tend to weaken the Government\'s position, but it will rarely force the Government to abandon a prosecution.  <em>Cf. infra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#950">468 U. S. 950</a></span>-951, and n. 11.  In my view, a doctrine that preserves intact the constitutional rights of the accused, and, at the same time, is sufficiently limited to permit society\'s legitimate and pressing interest in criminal law enforcement to be served should not be so recklessly discarded.  It is a doctrine that gives life to the</p>\n<p>"very heart of the Fourth Amendment directive:  that . . . a governmental search and seizure should represent both the efforts of the officer to gather evidence of wrongful acts and the judgment of the magistrate that the collected evidence is sufficient to justify invasion of a citizen\'s private premises."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. United States District Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/297/case.html">407 U.

Sheppard,</em> No. 82-963, the State concedes and the Court accepts that the warrant issued to search respondent\'s home completely failed to state with particularity the things to be seized.  Indeed, the warrant expressly and particularly described things such as "controlled substance[s]" and "other paraphernalia used in, for, or in connection with the unlawful possession or use of any controlled substance" that the police had no reason whatsoever to believe were to be found in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="947">Page 468 U. S. 947</a></p><p> respondent\'s home.  App. 17a.  Given the Fourth Amendment\'s requirement that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . and particularly describing the . . . things to be seized," this warrant should never have been issued.  The police who entered respondent\'s home, therefore, were without constitutional authority to do so.</p>\n<p>Although the Court\'s opinion tends to overlook this fact, the requirement of particularity is not a mere "technicality," it is an express constitutional command.  <em>Ybarra v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/85/case.html">444 U. S. 85</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/85/case.html#92">444 U.

The purpose of that requirement is to prevent precisely the kind of governmental conduct that the faulty warrant at issue here created a grave risk of permitting -- namely, a search that was not narrowly and particularly limited to the things that a neutral and detached magistrate had reason to believe might be found at respondent\'s home.  Although it is true, as JUSTICE STEVENS observes, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#964">468 U. S. 964</a></span>, that the affidavit submitted by the police set forth with particularity those items that they sought authority to search for, it is nevertheless clear that the warrant itself -- the document which actually gave the officers legal authority to invade respondent\'s privacy -- made no mention of these items.  And, although it is true that the particular officers who applied for the warrant also happened to execute it and did so in accordance with the limits proposed in their affidavit, this happenstance should have no bearing on the central question whether these officers secured that prior judicial authority to conduct their search required by the Fourth Amendment.  As we made clear in <em>United States v. United States District Court, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/297/case.html#317">407 U. S. 317</a></span> (footnote omitted), "[t]he Fourth Amendment contemplates a prior judicial judgment, not the risk that executive discretion may be reasonably exercised."  <em>See also Katz v.

Had the warrant actually been enforced by officers other than those who prepared the affidavit, the same result might not have occurred; indeed, the wholly erroneous nature of the warrant might have led such officers to feel at liberty to roam throughout respondent\'s home in search of drugs.  <em>Cf. Whiteley v. Warden,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/560/case.html">401 U. S. 560</a></span> (1971).  I therefore fail to see how a search pursuant to such a fundamentally defective warrant can be characterized as "reasonable . "</p>\n<p>What the Framers of the Bill of Rights sought to accomplish through the express requirements of the Fourth Amendment was to define precisely the conditions under which government agents could search private property so that citizens would not have to depend solely upon the discretion and restraint of those agents for the protection of their privacy.  Although the self-restraint and care exhibited by the officers in this case is commendable, that alone can never be a sufficient protection for constitutional liberties.  I am convinced that it is not too much to ask that an attentive magistrate take those minimum steps necessary to ensure that every warrant he issues describes with particularity the things that his independent review of the warrant application convinces him are likely to be found in the premises.  And I am equally convinced that it is not too much to ask that well-trained and experienced police officers take a moment to check that the warrant they have been issued at least describes those things for which they have sought leave to search.  These convictions spring not from my own view of sound criminal law enforcement policy, but are instead compelled by the language of the Fourth Amendment and the history that led to its adoption.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if I were to accept the Court\'s general approach to the exclusionary rule, I could not agree with today\'s result. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="949">Page 468 U.

Given this well-rehearsed pattern, one might have predicted with some assurance how the present case would unfold.  First there is the ritual incantation of the "substantial social costs" exacted by the exclusionary rule, followed by the virtually foreordained conclusion that, given the marginal benefits, application of the rule in the circumstances of these cases is not warranted.  Upon analysis, however, such a result cannot be justified even on the Court\'s own terms.</p>\n<p>At the outset, the Court suggests that society has been asked to pay a high price -- in terms either of setting guilty persons free or of impeding the proper functioning of trials -- as a result of excluding relevant physical evidence in cases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="950">Page 468 U. S. 950</a></p><p> where the police, in conducting searches and seizing evidence, have made only an "objectively reasonable" mistake concerning the constitutionality of their actions.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#907">468 U. S. 907</a></span>-908.  But what evidence is there to support such a claim?  Significantly, the Court points to none, and, indeed, as the Court acknowledges, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#907">468 U. S. 907</a></span>-908, n. 6, recent studies have demonstrated that the "costs" of the exclusionary rule -- calculated in terms of dropped prosecutions and lost convictions -- are quite low.  Contrary to the claims of the rule\'s critics that exclusion leads to "the release of countless guilty criminals," <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">403 U. S. 388</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html#416">403 U. S. 416</a></span> (1971) (BURGER, C.J., dissenting), these studies have demonstrated that federal and state prosecutors very rarely drop cases because of potential search and seizure problems.  For example, a 1979 study prepared at the request of Congress by the General Accounting Office reported that only 0.4% of all cases actually declined for prosecution by federal prosecutors were declined primarily because of illegal search problems.  Report of the Comptroller General of the United States, Impact of the Exclusionary Rule on Federal Criminal Prosecutions 14 (1979).  If the GAO data are restated as a percentage of all arrests, the study shows that only 0.2% of all felony arrests are declined for prosecution because of potential exclusionary rule problems.  <em>See</em> Davies, A Hard Look at What We Know (and Still Need to Learn) About the "Costs" of the Exclusionary Rule:  The NU Study and Other Studies of "Lost" Arrests, 1983 A.B.F.Res.J. 611, 635. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Of course, these data describe </p><p><a class="page-number" name="951">Page 468 U. S. 951</a></p><p> only the costs attributable to the exclusion of evidence in all cases; the costs due to the exclusion of evidence in the narrower category of cases where police have made objectively reasonable mistakes must necessarily be even smaller.  The Court, however, ignores this distinction and mistakenly weighs the aggregated costs of exclusion in all cases, irrespective of the circumstances that led to exclusion, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#907">468 U. S. 907</a></span>, against the potential benefits associated with only those cases in which evidence is excluded because police reasonably but mistakenly believe that their conduct does not violate the Fourth Amendment, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#915">468 U. S. 915</a></span>-921.  When such faulty scales are used, it is little wonder that the balance tips in favor of restricting the application of the rule. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="952">Page 468 U. S. 952</a></p><p></p>\n<p>What then supports the Court\'s insistence that this evidence be admitted?  Apparently, the Court\'s only answer is that, even though the costs of exclusion are not very substantial, the potential deterrent effect in these circumstances is so marginal that exclusion cannot be justified.  The key to the Court\'s conclusion in this respect is its belief that the prospective deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule operates only in those situations in which police officers, when deciding whether to go forward with some particular search, have reason to know that their planned conduct will violate the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#919">468 U. S. 919</a></span>-921.  If these officers in fact understand (or reasonably should understand because the law is well settled) that their proposed conduct will offend the Fourth Amendment and that, consequently, any evidence they seize will be suppressed in court, they will refrain from conducting the planned search.  In those circumstances, the incentive system created by the exclusionary rule will have the hoped-for deterrent effect.  But in situations where police officers reasonably (but mistakenly) believe that their planned conduct satisfies Fourth Amendment requirements -- presumably either (a) because they are acting on the basis of an apparently valid warrant, or (b) because their conduct is only later determined to be invalid as a result of a subsequent change in the law or the resolution of an unsettled question of law -- then such officers will have no reason to refrain from conducting the search, and the exclusionary rule will have no effect.</p>\n<p>At first blush, there is some logic to this position.  Undoubtedly, in the situation hypothesized by the Court, the existence of the exclusionary rule cannot be expected to have any deterrent effect on the particular officers at the moment they are deciding whether to go forward with the search.  Indeed, the subsequent exclusion of any evidence seized under such circumstances appears somehow "unfair" to the particular officers involved.  As the Court suggests, these officers have acted in what they thought was an appropriate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="953">Page 468 U. S. 953</a></p><p> and constitutionally authorized manner, but then the fruit of their efforts is nullified by the application of the exclusionary rule.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#920">468 U. S. 920</a></span>-921.</p>\n<p>The flaw in the Court\'s argument, however, is that its logic captures only one comparatively minor element of the generally acknowledged deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule.  To be sure, the rule operates to some extent to deter future misconduct by individual officers who have had evidence suppressed in their own cases.  But what the Court overlooks is that the deterrence rationale for the rule is not designed to be, nor should it be thought of as, a form of "punishment" of individual police officers for their failures to obey the restraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment.  <em>See United States v. Peltier,</em> 422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/531/case.html#556">422 U. S. 556</a></span>-557 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  Instead, the chief deterrent function of the rule is its tendency to promote institutional compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements on the part of law enforcement agencies generally. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Thus, as the Court has previously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="954">Page 468 U. S. 954</a></p><p> recognized,</p>\n<p>"over the long-term, [the] demonstration [provided by the exclusionary rule] that our society attaches serious consequences to violation of constitutional rights is thought to encourage those who formulate law enforcement policies, and the officers who implement them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals into their value system."</p>\n<p><em>Stone v. Powell,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html#492">428 U. S. 492</a></span>.  It is only through such an institutionwide mechanism that information concerning Fourth Amendment standards can be effectively communicated to rank-and-file officers. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="955">Page 468 U. S. 955</a></p><p></p>\n<p>If the overall educational effect of the exclusionary rule is considered, application of the rule to even those situations in which individual police officers have acted on the basis of a reasonable but mistaken belief that their conduct was authorized can still be expected to have a considerable long-term deterrent effect.  If evidence is consistently excluded in these circumstances, police departments will surely be prompted to instruct their officers to devote greater care and attention to providing sufficient information to establish probable cause when applying for a warrant, and to review with some attention the form of the warrant that they have been issued, rather than automatically assuming that whatever document the magistrate has signed will necessarily comport with Fourth Amendment requirements.</p>\n<p>After today\'s decisions, however, that institutional incentive will be lost.  Indeed, the Court\'s "reasonable mistake" exception to the exclusionary rule will tend to put a premium on police ignorance of the law.  Armed with the assurance provided by today\'s decisions that evidence will always be admissible whenever an officer has "reasonably" relied upon a warrant, police departments will be encouraged to train officers that, if a warrant has simply been signed, it is reasonable, without more, to rely on it.  Since in close cases there will no longer be any incentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior, police would have every reason to adopt a "let\'s-wait-until-it\'s-decided" approach in situations in which there is a question about a warrant\'s validity or the basis for its issuance.  <em>Cf. United States v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html">457 U. S. 537</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/case.html#561">457 U. S. 561</a></span> (1982). [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="956">Page 468 U. S. 956</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although the Court brushes these concerns aside, a host of grave consequences can be expected to result from its decision to carve this new exception out of the exclusionary rule.  A chief consequence of today\'s decisions will be to convey a clear and unambiguous message to magistrates that their decisions to issue warrants are now insulated from subsequent judicial review.  Creation of this new exception for good faith reliance upon a warrant implicitly tells magistrates that they need not take much care in reviewing warrant applications, since their mistakes will, from now on, have virtually no consequence:  if their decision to issue a warrant was correct, the evidence will be admitted; if their decision was incorrect but the police relied in good faith on the warrant, the evidence will also be admitted.  Inevitably, the care and attention devoted to such an inconsequential chore will dwindle.  Although the Court is correct to note that magistrates do not share the same stake in the outcome of a criminal case as the police, they nevertheless need to appreciate that their role is of some moment in order to continue performing the important task of carefully reviewing warrant applications.  Today\'s decisions effectively remove that incentive. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="957">Page 468 U. S. 957</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, the good faith exception will encourage police to provide only the bare minimum of information in future warrant applications.  The police will now know that, if they can secure a warrant, so long as the circumstances of its issuance are not "entirely unreasonable," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#923">468 U. S. 923</a></span>, all police conduct pursuant to that warrant will be protected from further judicial review. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  The clear incentive that operated in the past to establish probable cause adequately because reviewing courts would examine the magistrate\'s judgment carefully, <em>see, e.g., Franks v. Delaware,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/154/case.html">438 U.

S. 923</a></span>.  The long-run effect unquestionably will be to undermine the integrity of the warrant process.</p>\n<p>Finally, even if one were to believe, as the Court apparently does, that police are hobbled by inflexible and hypertechnical warrant procedures, today\'s decisions cannot be justified.  This is because, given the relaxed standard for assessing probable cause established just last Term in <em>Illinois v. Gates,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html">462 U. S. 213</a></span> (1983), the Court\'s newly fashioned good faith exception, when applied in the warrant context, will rarely, if ever, offer any greater flexibility for police than the <em>Gates</em> standard already supplies.  In <em>Gates,</em> the Court held that</p>\n<p>"[t]he task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#238">462 U. S. 238</a></span>.  The task of a reviewing court is confined to determining whether "the magistrate had a <em>substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]\' that probable cause existed."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Given such a relaxed standard, it is virtually inconceivable that a reviewing court, when faced with a defendant\'s motion to suppress, could first find that a warrant was invalid under the new <em>Gates</em> standard, but then, at the same time, find that a police officer\'s reliance on such an invalid warrant was nevertheless "objectively reasonable" under the test announced today. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Because the two standards overlap so completely, it is unlikely that a warrant could be found invalid under <em>Gates</em> and yet the police reliance upon it could be seen as objectively reasonable; otherwise, we would have to entertain the mind-boggling </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="959">Page 468 U. S. 959</a></em></p><p><em> concept of objectively reasonable reliance upon an objectively unreasonable warrant.\n</em></p>\n<p>This paradox, as JUSTICE STEVENS suggests, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#961">468 U. S. 961</a></span>-962, perhaps explains the Court\'s unwillingness to remand No. 82-1771 for reconsideration in light of <em>Gates,</em> for it is quite likely that, on remand, the Court of Appeals would find no violation of the Fourth Amendment, thereby demonstrating that the supposed need for the good faith exception in this context is more apparent than real.  Therefore, although the Court\'s decisions are clearly limited to the situation in which police officers reasonably rely upon an apparently valid warrant in conducting a search, I am not at all confident that the exception unleashed today will remain so confined.  Indeed, the full impact of the Court\'s regrettable decisions will not be felt until the Court attempts to extend this rule to situations in which the police have conducted a warrantless search solely on the basis of their own judgment about the existence of probable cause and exigent circumstances.  When that question is finally posed, I for one will not be surprised if my colleagues decide once again that we simply cannot afford to protect Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>When the public, as it quite properly has done in the past as well as in the present, demands that those in government increase their efforts to combat crime, it is all too easy for those government officials to seek expedient solutions.  In contrast to such costly and difficult measures as building more prisons, improving law enforcement methods, or hiring more prosecutors and judges to relieve the overburdened court systems in the country\'s metropolitan areas, the relaxation of Fourth Amendment standards seems a tempting, costless means of meeting the public\'s demand for better law enforcement.  In the long run, however, we as a society pay a heavy price for such expediency, because, as Justice Jackson observed, the rights guaranteed in the Fourth Amendment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="960">Page 468 U.

National Institute of Justice, Criminal Justice Research Report -- The Effects of the Exclusionary Rule:  A Study in California 1 (1982).

For example, a study based on data from nine mid-sized counties in Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania reveals that motions to suppress physical evidence were filed in approximately 5% of the 7,500 cases studied, but that such motions were successful in only 0.7% of all these cases.

Instead, the rule is designed to produce a \'systematic deterrence:\'  the exclusionary rule is intended to create an incentive for law enforcement officials to establish procedures by which police officers are trained to comply with the fourth amendment because the purpose of the criminal justice system -- bringing criminals to justice -- can be achieved only when evidence of guilt may be used against defendants."</p>\n<p>Stewart, 83 Colum.L.Rev. at 1400.  <em>See also</em> Oaks, Studying the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 665, 709-710 (1970) ("The exclusionary rule is not aimed at special deterrence, since it does not impose any direct punishment on a law enforcement official who has broken the rule. . . .

For example, as former New York Police Commissioner Murphy explained the impact of the <em>Mapp</em> decision:</p>\n<p>"I can think of no decision in recent times in the field of law enforcement which had such a dramatic and traumatic effect. . . .

S. 981</a></span>, and dissenting in No. 82-1771.</p>\n<p>It is appropriate to begin with the plain language of the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<p>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</p>\n<p>The Court assumes that the searches in these cases violated the Fourth Amendment, yet refuses to apply the exclusionary rule because the Court concludes that it was "reasonable" for the police to conduct them.  In my opinion, an official search and seizure cannot be both "unreasonable" and "reasonable" at the same time.  The doctrinal vice in the Court\'s holding is its failure to consider the separate purposes of the two prohibitory Clauses in the Fourth Amendment.  The first Clause prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and the second prohibits the issuance of warrants that are not supported by probable cause or that do not particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.  We have, of course, repeatedly held that warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="961">Page 468 U. S. 961</a></p><p> and that there are only a few carefully delineated exceptions to that basic presumption. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  But when such an exception has been recognized, analytically we have necessarily concluded that the warrantless activity was not "unreasonable" within the meaning of the first Clause.  Thus, any Fourth Amendment case may present two separate questions:  whether the search was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued in accordance with the second Clause, and, if not, whether it was nevertheless "reasonable" within the meaning of the first.  On these questions, the constitutional text requires that we speak with one voice.  We cannot intelligibly assume, <em>arguendo,</em> that a search was constitutionally unreasonable but that the seized evidence is admissible because the same search was reasonable.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In No. 82-963, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts determined that a warrant which purported to authorize a search of respondent\'s home had been issued in violation of the Warrant Clause.  In its haste to make new law, this Court does not tarry to consider this holding.  Yet, as I will demonstrate, this holding is clearly wrong; I would reverse the judgment on that ground alone.</p>\n<p>In No. 82-1771, there is also a substantial question whether the warrant complied with the Fourth Amendment.  There was a strong dissent on the probable cause issue when <em>Leon</em> was before the Court of Appeals, and that dissent has been given added force by this Court\'s intervening decision in <em>Illinois v. Gates,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html">462 U. S. 213</a></span> (1983), which constituted a significant development in the law.  It is probable, though admittedly not certain, that the Court of Appeals would now conclude that the warrant in <em>Leon</em> satisfied the Fourth Amendment if it were given the opportunity to reconsider the issue in the light of <em>Gates.</em>  Adherence to our normal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="962">Page 468 U.

[<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>It is, of course, disturbing that the Court chooses one case in which there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment, and another in which there is grave doubt on the question, in order to promulgate a "good faith" exception to the Fourth Amendment\'s exclusionary rule.  The Court\'s explanation for its failure to decide the merits of the Fourth Amendment question in No. 82-963 is that it "is a fact-bound issue of little importance," <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/case.html#988">468 U. S. 988</a></span>, n. 5.  In No. 82-1771, the Court acknowledges that the case could be remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Gates,</em> yet does not bother to explain why it fails to do so except to note that it is "within our power" to decide the broader question in the case.  <em>United States v. Leon, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/case.html#905">468 U. S. 905</a></span>.  The Court seems determined to decide these cases on the broadest possible grounds; such determination is utterly at odds with the Court\'s traditional practice, as well as any principled notion of judicial restraint.  Decisions made in this manner are unlikely to withstand the test of time.</p>\n<p>Judges, more than most, should understand the value of adherence to settled procedures.  By adopting a set of fair procedures, and then adhering to them, courts of law ensure that justice is administered with an even hand.</p>\n<p>"These are subtle matters, for they concern the ingredients of what constitutes justice.  Therefore, justice must satisfy the appearance of justice."</p>\n<p><em>Offutt v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/11/case.html">348 U.

Of course, this Court has a duty to face questions of constitutional law when necessary to the disposition of an actual case or controversy.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

But when the Court goes beyond what is necessary to decide the case before it, it can only encourage the perception that it is pursuing its own notions of wise social policy, rather than adhering to its judicial role.  I do not believe the Court should reach out to decide what is undoubtedly a profound question concerning the administration of criminal justice before assuring itself that this question is actually and of necessity presented by the concrete facts before the Court.  Although it may appear that the Court\'s broad holding will serve the public interest in enforcing obedience to the rule of law, for my part, I remain firmly convinced that "the preservation of order in our communities will be best ensured by adherence to established and respected procedures."  <em>Groppi v. Leslie,</em> 436 F.2d 331, 336 (CA7 1971) (en banc) (Stevens, J., dissenting), <em>rev\'d,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/496/case.html">404 U. S. 496</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In No. 82-963, there is no contention that the police officers did not receive appropriate judicial authorization for their search of respondent\'s residence.  A neutral and detached judicial officer had correctly determined that there was probable cause to conduct a search.  Nevertheless, the Supreme Judicial Court suppressed the fruits of the search because the warrant did not particularly describe the place to be searched and the things to be seized.</p>\n<p>The particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment has a manifest purpose -- to prevent general searches.  By limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search, the requirement ensures that the search is carefully tailored to its justification, and does not resemble the wide-ranging general searches that the Framers intended to prohibit. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  In this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="964">Page 468 U. S. 964</a></p><p> case the warrant did not come close to authorizing a general search. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The affidavit supporting the application for the warrant correctly identified the things to be seized, and on its face the affidavit indicated that it had been presented to the judge who had issued the warrant. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  Both the police officers and the judge were fully aware of the contents of the affidavit, and therefore knew precisely what the officers were authorized to search for.  Since the affidavit was available for after-the-fact review, the Massachusetts courts could readily ascertain the limits of the officers\' authority under the warrant.  In short, the judge who issued the warrant, the police officers who executed it, and the reviewing courts all were able easily to ascertain the precise scope of the authorization provided by the warrant.</p>\n<p>All that our cases require is that a warrant contain a description sufficient to enable the officers who execute it to ascertain with reasonable effort where they are to search and what they are to seize. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  The test is whether the executing officers\' discretion has been limited in a way that forbids a general search. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]  Here there was no question that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="965">Page 468 U. S. 965</a></p><p> executing officers\' discretion had been limited -- they, as well as the reviewing courts, knew the precise limits of their authorization.  There was simply no "occasion or opportunity for officers to rummage at large," <em>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/547/case.html">436 U. S. 547</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/547/case.html#566">436 U. S. 566</a></span> (1978). [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]</p>\n<p>The only Fourth Amendment interest that is arguably implicated by the "defect" in the warrant is the citizen\'s interest in being able to ascertain the limits of the officers\' authorization by examining the warrant. [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  Respondent, however, was not home at the time the warrant was executed, and therefore had no occasion to see the warrant.  The two persons who were present when the warrant was executed, respondent\'s mother and sister, did not read the warrant or ask to have it read.</p>\n<p>"[T]he general rule [is] that Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted."</p>\n<p><em>Alderman v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html">394 U. S. 165</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/165/case.html#174">394 U. S. 174</a></span> (1969).  Thus, respondent, who has standing to assert only his own Fourth Amendment interests, [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>] cannot complain that his interest in ascertaining the limits of the officers\' authority under the search warrant was infringed. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  In short, our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="966">Page 468 U. S. 966</a></p><p> precedents construing the particularity requirement of the Warrant Clause unambiguously demonstrate that this warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even if it be assumed that there was a technical violation of the particularity requirement in No. 82-963, it by no means follows that the "warrantless" search in that case was "unreasonable" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  For this search posed none of the dangers to which the Fourth Amendment is addressed.  It was justified by a neutral magistrate\'s determination of probable cause, and created no risk of a general search.  It was eminently "reasonable."</p>\n<p>In No. 82-1771, however, the Government now admits -- at least for the tactical purpose of achieving what it regards as a greater benefit -- that the substance, as well as the letter, of the Fourth Amendment was violated.  The Court therefore assumes that the warrant in that case was not supported by probable cause, but refuses to suppress the evidence obtained thereby because it considers the police conduct to satisfy a "newfangled" nonconstitutional standard of reasonableness. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  Yet if the Court\'s assumption is correct -- if there was no probable cause -- it must follow that it was "unreasonable" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="967">Page 468 U. S. 967</a></p><p> for the authorities to make unheralded entries into and searches of private dwellings and automobiles.  The Court\'s conclusion that such searches undertaken without probable cause can nevertheless be "reasonable" is totally without support in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>Just last Term, the Court explained what probable cause to issue a warrant means:</p>\n<p>"The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \'veracity\' and the \'basis of knowledge\' of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."</p>\n<p><em>Illinois v. Gates,</em> 462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#238">462 U. S. 238</a></span>.  Moreover, in evaluating the existence of probable cause, reviewing courts must give substantial deference to the magistrate\'s determination. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  In doubtful cases, the warrant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="968">Page 468 U. S. 968</a></p><p> should be sustained. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  The judgment as to whether there is probable cause must be made in a practical and nontechnical manner. [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>]  The probable cause standard therefore gives law enforcement officers ample room to engage in any reasonable law enforcement activity.  What is more, the standard has been familiar to the law enforcement profession for centuries. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  In an opinion written in 1949, and endorsed by the Court last Term in <em>Gates,</em> we explained:</p>\n<p>"These long-prevailing standards seek to safeguard citizens from rash and unreasonable interferences with privacy and from unfounded charges of crime.  They also seek to give fair leeway for enforcing the law in the community\'s protection.  Because many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part.  But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.  The rule of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these often opposing interests.  Requiring more would unduly hamper law enforcement.  To allow less would be to leave law-abiding citizens at the mercy of the officers\' whim or caprice."</p>\n<p><em>Brinegar v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/case.html">338 U. S. 160</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/160/case.html#176">338 U. S. 176</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the majority\'s assumption is correct, that even after paying heavy deference to the magistrate\'s finding and resolving all doubt in its favor, there is no probable cause here, then by definition -- as a matter of constitutional law -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="969">Page 468 U. S. 969</a></p><p> the officers\' conduct was unreasonable. [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>]  The Court\'s own hypothesis is that there was no fair likelihood that the officers would find evidence of a crime, and hence there was no reasonable law enforcement justification for their conduct. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority\'s contrary conclusion rests on the notion that it must be reasonable for a police officer to rely on a magistrate\'s finding.  Until today, that has plainly not been the law; it has been well settled that, even when a magistrate issues a warrant, there is no guarantee that the ensuing search and seizure is constitutionally reasonable.  Law enforcement officers have long been on notice that, despite the magistrate\'s decision, a warrant will be invalidated if the officers did not provide sufficient facts to enable the magistrate to evaluate the existence of probable cause responsibly and independently. [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>]  Reviewing courts have always inquired into whether the magistrate acted properly in issuing the warrant -- not merely whether the officers acted properly in executing it.  <em>See Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/257/case.html">362 U.

[<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]  Indeed, just last Term, in <em>Gates,</em> after noting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="970">Page 468 U.

In order to ensure that such an abdication of the magistrate\'s duty does not occur, courts must continue to conscientiously review the sufficiency of affidavits on which warrants are issued."</p>\n<p>462 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/case.html#239">462 U. S. 239</a></span>. [<a href="#F3/22" name="T3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, under our cases, it has never been "reasonable" for the police to rely on the mere fact that a warrant has issued; the police have always known that, if they fail to supply the magistrate with sufficient information, the warrant will be held invalid, and its fruits excluded. [<a href="#F3/23" name="T3/23">Footnote 3/23</a>]</p>\n<p>The notion that a police officer\'s reliance on a magistrate\'s warrant is automatically appropriate is one the Framers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="971">Page 468 U. S. 971</a></p><p> the Fourth Amendment would have vehemently rejected.  The precise problem that the Amendment was intended to address was <em>the unreasonable issuance of warrants.</em>  As we have often observed, the Amendment was actually motivated by the practice of issuing general warrants -- warrants which did not satisfy the particularity and probable cause requirements. [<a href="#F3/24" name="T3/24">Footnote 3/24</a>]  The resentments which led to the Amendment were directed at the issuance of warrants unjustified by particularized evidence of wrongdoing. [<a href="#F3/25" name="T3/25">Footnote 3/25</a>]  Those who sought to amend the Constitution to include a Bill of Rights repeatedly voiced the view that the evil which had to be addressed was the issuance of warrants on insufficient evidence. [<a href="#F3/26" name="T3/26">Footnote 3/26</a>]  As Professor Taylor has written: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="972">Page 468 U. S. 972</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"[O]ur constitutional fathers were not concerned about warrantless searches, but about overreaching warrants.  It is perhaps too much to say that they feared the warrant more than the search, but it is plain enough that the warrant was the prime object of their concern.  Far from looking at the warrant as a protection against unreasonable searches, they saw it as an authority for unreasonable and oppressive searches. . . ."</p>\n<p>T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969).</p>\n<p>In short, the Framers of the Fourth Amendment were deeply suspicious of warrants; in their minds, the paradigm of an abusive search was the execution of a warrant not based on probable cause.  The fact that colonial officers had magisterial authorization for their conduct when they engaged in general searches surely did not make their conduct "reasonable."  The Court\'s view that it is consistent with our Constitution to adopt a rule that it is presumptively reasonable to rely on a defective warrant is the product of constitutional amnesia.

And one need only briefly to have dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but deprived of these rights to know that the human personality deteriorates and dignity and self-reliance disappear where homes, persons and possessions are subject at any hour to unheralded search and seizure by the police."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Only occasional and more flagrant abuses come to the attention of the courts, and then only those where the search and seizure yields incriminating evidence and the defendant is at least sufficiently compromised to be indicted.  If the officers raid a home, an office, or stop and search an automobile but find nothing incriminating, this invasion of the personal liberty of the innocent too often finds no practical redress.  There may be, and I am convinced that there are, many unlawful searches of homes and automobiles of innocent people which turn up nothing incriminating, in which no arrest is made, about which courts do nothing, and about which we never hear."</p>\n<p>"Courts can protect the innocent against such invasions only indirectly and through the medium of excluding evidence obtained against those who frequently are guilty. . . .

[<a href="#F3/29" name="T3/29">Footnote 3/29</a>]  If the police cannot use evidence obtained through warrants issued on less than probable cause, they have less incentive to seek those warrants, and magistrates have less incentive to issue them.</p>\n<p>Today\'s decisions do grave damage to that deterrent function.

Official awareness of the dubious constitutionality of a practice would be counterbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the Fourth Amendment law in the area remained unsettled, evidence obtained through the questionable practice would be excluded only in the one case definitively resolving the unsettled question.  Failure to accord <em>any</em> retroactive effect to Fourth Amendment rulings would \'encourage police or other courts to disregard the plain purport of our decisions and to adopt a let\'s-wait-until-it\'s-decided approach.\'"</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

[<a href="#F3/30" name="T3/30">Footnote 3/30</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court is, of course, correct that the exclusionary rule cannot deter when the authorities have no reason to know that their conduct is unconstitutional.  But when probable cause is lacking, then by definition a reasonable person under the circumstances would not believe there is a fair likelihood that a search will produce evidence of a crime.  Under such circumstances, well-trained professionals must know that they are violating the Constitution.  The Court\'s approach -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="976">Page 468 U.

Courts simply cannot escape their responsibility for redressing constitutional violations if they admit evidence obtained through unreasonable searches and seizures, since the entire point of police conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment is to obtain evidence for use at trial.  If such evidence is admitted, then the courts become not merely the final and necessary link in an unconstitutional chain of events, but its actual motivating force.</p>\n<p>"If the existing code does not permit district attorneys to have a hand in such dirty business, it does not permit the judge to allow such iniquities to succeed."</p>\n<p><em>Olmstead v.

Unlike the fear of personal liability, it should not create excessive deterrence; moreover, it avoids the obvious unfairness of subjecting the dedicated officer to the risk of monetary liability for a misstep while endeavoring to enforce the law.  Society, rather than the individual officer, should accept the responsibility for inadequate training or supervision of officers engaged in hazardous police work.  What THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrote, some two decades ago, remains true today:</p>\n<p>"It is the proud claim of a democratic society that the people are masters and all officials of the state are servants of the people.  That being so, the ancient rule of <em>respondeat superior</em> furnishes us with a simple, direct and reasonable basis for refusing to admit evidence secured in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions.  Since the policeman is society\'s servant, his acts in the execution of his duty are attributable to the master or employer.  Society as a whole is thus responsible, and society is \'penalized\' by refusing it the benefit of evidence secured by the illegal action.  This satisfies me more than the other explanations because it seems to me that society -- in a country like ours -- is involved in and is responsible for what is done in its name and by its agents.  Unlike the Germans of the 1930\'s and early \'40\'s, we cannot say \'it is all The Leader\'s doing.  I am not responsible.\'  In a representative democracy, we are responsible, whether we like it or not.  And so each of us is involved and each is in this sense responsible when a police officer breaks rules of law established for our common protection."</p>\n<p>Burger, Who Will Watch the Watchman?, 14 Am.U.L.Rev. 1, 14 (1964) (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/29" name="F3/29">Footnote 3/29</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Stone v.

The United States Marshal could only have invaded the house of the accused when armed with a warrant issued as required by the Constitution, upon sworn information and describing with reasonable particularity the things for which the search was to be made.  Instead, he acted without sanction of law, doubtless prompted by the desire to bring further proof to the aid of the Government, and, under color of his office, undertook to make a seizure of private papers in direct violation of the constitutional prohibition against such action.  Under such circumstances, without sworn information and particular description, not even an order of court would have justified such procedure. . . .
