See\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605A.  Prevailing plaintiffs, however, often face practical and legal difficulties enforcing their judgments.  To place beyond dispute the availability of certain assets for satisfaction of judgments rendered in terrorism cases against Iran, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.  As relevant here, the Act makes a designated set of assets available to satisfy the judgments underlying a consolidated enforcement proceeding which the statute identifies by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket number.\n\n22 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78772.  Section 8772(a)(2) requires a court, before allowing execution against these assets, to determine, <i>inter alia</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Iran holds equitable title to, or the beneficial interest in, the assets.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents\xe2\x80\x94more than 1,000 victims of Iran-sponsored acts of terrorism, their estate representatives, and surviving family members\xe2\x80\x94rank within 16 discrete groups, each of which brought suit against Iran.  To enforce judgments they obtained by default, the 16 groups moved for turnover of about $1.75 billion in bond assets held in a New York bank account\xe2\x80\x94assets that, respondents alleged, were owned by Bank Markazi, the Central Bank of Iran.  The turnover proceeding began in 2008. In 2012, the judgment holders updated their motions to include execution claims under \xc2\xa78772.  Bank Markazi maintained that \xc2\xa78772 could not withstand inspection under the separation-of-powers doctrine, contending that Congress had usurped the judicial role by directing a particular result in the pending enforcement proceeding.  The District Court disagreed, concluding that \xc2\xa78772 permissibly changed the law applicable in a pending litigation.  The Second Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Section 8772 does not violate the separation of powers.

Necessarily, that endowment of authority blocks Congress from \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] federal courts to exercise the judicial power in a manner that Article III forbids.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n.  Although Article III bars Congress from telling a court how to apply pre-existing law to particular circumstances, <i>Robertson</i> v. <i>Seattle Audubon Soc.</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 429\n\xe2\x80\x93439, Congress may amend a law and make the amended prescription retroactively applicable in pending cases, <i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n\xe2\x80\x93268; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Schooner Peggy</i>, 1 Cranch 103, 110.  In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall. 128, 146, this Court enigmatically observed that Congress may not \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in [pending] cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  More recent decisions have clarified that <i>Klein</i> does not inhibit Congress from \xe2\x80\x9camend[ing] applicable law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Robertson</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 441; <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218.  Section 8772 does just that: It requires a court to apply a new legal standard in a pending postjudgment enforcement proceeding.  No different result obtains because, as Bank Markazi argues, the outcome of applying \xc2\xa78772 to the facts in the proceeding below was a \xe2\x80\x9cforegone conclusio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 47.  A statute does not impinge on judicial power when it directs courts to apply a new legal standard to undisputed facts.  See <i>Pope</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Nor is \xc2\xa78772 invalid because, as Bank Markazi further objects, it prescribes a rule for a single, pending case identified by caption and docket number.  The amended law upheld in <i>Robertson </i>also applied to cases identified in the statute by caption and docket number.  503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 440.  Moreover, \xc2\xa78772 is not an instruction governing one case only: It facilitates execution of judgments in 16 suits.  While consolidated for administrative purposes at the execution stage, the judgment-execution claims were not independent of the original actions for damages and each retained its separate character.  In any event, the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on the flawed assumption that legislation must be generally applicable.  See <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 239, n.\xc2\xa09.  This Court and lower courts have upheld as a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legislative power laws governing one or a very small number of specific subjects.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Adding weight to this decision, \xc2\xa78772 is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs, a domain in which the controlling role of the political branches is both necessary and proper.  Measures taken by the political branches to control the disposition of foreign-state property, including<i> </i>blocking specific foreign-state assets or making them available for attachment, have never been rejected as invasions upon the Article III judicial power.  Cf. <i>Dames &amp; Moore</i> v. <i>Regan</i>,\n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 654\n.  Notably, before enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the Executive regularly made case-specific determinations whether sovereign immunity should be recognized, and courts accepted those determinations as binding.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Republic of Austria</i> v. <i>Altmann</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677\n\xe2\x80\x93691.

The assets would partially satisfy judgments gained in separate actions by over 1,000 victims of terrorist acts sponsored by Iran.  The judgments remain unpaid.  Section 8772 is an unusual statute: It designates a particular set of assets and renders them available to satisfy the liability and damages judgments underlying a consoli-dated enforcement proceeding that the statute identifies by the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s docket number.  The question raised by petitioner Bank Markazi: Does \xc2\xa78772 violate the separation of powers by purporting to change the law for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 8772, we hold, does not transgress constraints placed on Congress and the President by the Constitution.  The statute, we point out, is not fairly portrayed as a \xe2\x80\x9cone-case-only regime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 27.  Rather, it covers a category of postjudgment execution claims filed by numerous plaintiffs who, in multiple civil actions, obtained evidence-based judgments against Iran together amounting to billions of dollars.  Section 8772 subjects the designated assets to execution \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy <i>any</i> judgment\xe2\x80\x9d against Iran for damages caused by specified acts of terrorism.  \xc2\xa78772(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Action in that realm warrants respectful review by courts.  The Executive has histori-cally made case-specific sovereign-immunity determinations to which courts have deferred.  And exercise by Congress and the President of control over claims against foreign governments, as well as foreign-government-owned property in the United States, is hardly a novelty.  In accord with the courts below, we perceive in \xc2\xa78772 no violation of separation-of-powers principles, and no threat to the independence of the Judiciary.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We set out here statutory provisions relevant to this case.

In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Padelford</i>, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870), this Court held that the recipient of a Presidential pardon must be treated as loyal, <i>i.e., </i>the pardon operated as \xe2\x80\x9ca complete substitute for proof that [the recipient] gave no aid or comfort to the rebellion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thereafter, Klein prevailed in an action in the Court of Claims, yielding an award of $125,300 for Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s cotton.  13 Wall., at 132.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">During the pendency of an appeal to this Court from the Court of Claims judgment in <i>Klein</i>, Congress enacted a statute providing that no pardon should be admissible as proof of loyalty.  Moreover, acceptance of a pardon without disclaiming participation in the rebellion would serve as conclusive evidence of disloyalty.  The statute directed the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court to dismiss for want of jurisdiction any claim based on a pardon.\n\n16Stat.\n235; R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 323, n. 29 (7th ed. 2015) (Hart and Wechsler).  Affirming the judgment of the Court of Claims, this Court held that Congress had no authority to \xe2\x80\x9cimpai[r] the effect of a pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d for the Constitution entrusted the pardon power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the executive alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall., at 147.

Lacking authority to impair the pardon power of the Executive, Congress could not \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t] [a] court to be instrumental to that end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  In other words, the statute in <i>Klein</i> infringed the judicial power, not because it left too little for courts to do, but because it attempted to direct the result without altering the legal standards governing the effect of a pardon\xe2\x80\x94standards Congress was powerless to prescribe.

The Bank points to a statement in the <i>Klein</i> opinion questioning whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislature may prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in cases pending before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  13 Wall., at 146.  One cannot take this language from <i>Klein</i> \xe2\x80\x9cat face value,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cfor congressional power to make valid statutes retroactively applicable to pending cases has often been recognized.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hart and Wechsler 324.  See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Schooner Peggy</i>, 1 Cranch 103, 110 (1801).  As we explained in <i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244,\n267 (1994)\n, the restrictions that the Constitution places on retroactive legislation \xe2\x80\x9care of limited scope\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation.  Article I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa01, prohibits States from passing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. laws \xe2\x80\x98impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\xe2\x80\x99  The\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for a \xe2\x80\x98public use\xe2\x80\x99 and upon payment of \xe2\x80\x98just compensation.\xe2\x80\x99  The prohibitions on \xe2\x80\x98Bills of Attainder\xe2\x80\x99 in Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 9\xe2\x80\x9310, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct.  The Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute\xe2\x80\x99s prospective application under the Clause \xe2\x80\x98may not suffice\xe2\x80\x99 to warrant its retroactive application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 266\xe2\x80\x93267 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cAbsent a violation of one of those specific provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d when a new law makes clear that it is retroactive, the arguable \xe2\x80\x9cunfairness of retroactive civil legislation is not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give [that law] its intended scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 267\xe2\x80\x93268.  So yes, we have affirmed, Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases.  See <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226.  Any lingering doubts on that score have been dispelled by <i>Robertson</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 441, and <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bank Markazi argues most strenuously that \xc2\xa78772 did not simply amend pre-existing law.  Because the judicial findings contemplated by \xc2\xa78772 were \xe2\x80\x9cforegone conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Bank urges, the statute \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively\xe2\x80\x9d directed certain factfindings and specified the outcome under the amended law.  See Brief for Petitioner 42, 47.  See also <i>post, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.

In <i>Schooner Peggy</i>, 1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Cranch, at 109\xe2\x80\x93110, for example, this Court applied a newly ratified treaty that, by requiring the return of captured property, effectively permitted only one possible outcome.  And in <i>Robertson</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435, 438\xe2\x80\x93439, a statute replaced governing environmental-law restraints on timber harvesting with new legislation that permitted harvesting in all but certain designated areas.  Without inquiring whether the new statute\xe2\x80\x99s application in pending cases was a \xe2\x80\x9cforegone conclusio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 47, we upheld the legislation because it left for judicial determination whether any particular actions violated the new prescription.  In short, \xc2\xa78772 changed the law by establishing new substantive standards, entrusting to the District Court application of those standards to the facts (contested or uncontested) found by the court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Resisting this conclusion, The Chief Justice compares \xc2\xa78772 to a hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9claw directing judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was duly served with notice of the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a>]  Of course, the hypothesized law would be invalid\xe2\x80\x94as would a law directing judgment for Smith, for instance, if the court finds that the sun rises in the east.  For one thing, a law so cast may well be irrational and, therefore, unconstitutional for reasons distinct from the separation-of-powers issues considered here.  See, <i>e.g., infra</i>, at 21, n. 27.  For another, the law imagined by the dissent does what <i>Robertson</i> says Congress cannot do: Like a statute that directs, in \xe2\x80\x9cSmith v.

Yet, in this case, Congress arrogated that power to itself.  Since 2008, respondents have sought $1.75 billion in assets owned by Bank Markazi, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s central bank, in order to satisfy judgments against Iran for acts of terrorism.  The Bank has vigorously opposed those efforts, asserting numerous legal defenses.  So, in 2012, four years into the litigation, respondents persuaded Congress to enact a statute,\n\n22 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78772, that for this case alone eliminates each of the defenses standing in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 way.

Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776\xe2\x80\x931787, pp. 154\xe2\x80\x93155 (1969).  And they routinely intervened in cases still pending before courts, granting continuances, stays of judgments, \xe2\x80\x9cnew trials, and other kinds of relief in an effort to do what \xe2\x80\x98is agreeable to Right and Justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 155; see Judicial Action by the Provincial Legislature of Massachusetts, 15 Harv. L.

In the Colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, for example, the assemblies officially served as the highest court of appeals.  See<i> </i>1 The Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut 25 (Trumbull ed. 1850); M. Clarke, Parliamentary Privilege in the American Colonies 31\xe2\x80\x9333 (1943).  Likewise, for more than a half century, the colonial assembly of Virginia could review and set aside court judgments.  <i>Id.,</i> at 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  And in New Hampshire, where British authorities directed judicial appeals to the governor and his council, those officials often referred such matters to the assembly for decision.  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.  Colonial assemblies thus sat atop the judicial pyramid, with the final word over when and how private disputes would be resolved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Legislative involvement in judicial matters intensified during the American Revolution, fueled by the \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous, indeed often radical, populism of the revolutionary legislatures and assemblies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 219; see Wood, <i>supra,</i> at 155\xe2\x80\x93156.  The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 epitomized the ethos of legislative supremacy.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 541, 547\xe2\x80\x93548, 556 (1989).

In 1778, an influential critique of a proposed (and ultimately rejected) Massachusetts constitution warned that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the legislative and judicial powers are united, the maker of the law will also interpret it; and the law may then speak a language, dictated by the whims, the caprice, or the prejudice of the judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Essex Result, in<i> </i>The Popular Sources of Political Authority: Documents on the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, p. 337 (O.

And in Pennsylvania, the Council of Censors\xe2\x80\x94a body appointed to assess compliance with the state constitution\xe2\x80\x94decried the state assembly\xe2\x80\x99s practice of \xe2\x80\x9cextending their deliberations to the cases of individuals\xe2\x80\x9d instead of deferring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe usual process of law,\xe2\x80\x9d citing instances when the assembly overturned fines, settled estates, and suspended prosecutions.

To help ensure the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete independence of the courts of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, they provided life tenure for judges and protection against diminution of their compensation.  But such safeguards against indirect interference would have been meaningless if Congress could simply exercise the judicial power di-rectly.

And Congress cannot \xe2\x80\x9cretroactively command[\xc2\xa0] the federal courts to reopen final judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d because Article III \xe2\x80\x9cgives the Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to <i>decide</i> them, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article III hierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218\xe2\x80\x93219.

Section 8772(a)(1) eliminates that immunity.

Neither the majority nor respondents have identified another statute that changed the law for a pending case in an outcome-determinative way and explicitly limited its effect to particular judicial proceedings.  That fact alone is \xe2\x80\x9c[p]erhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem\xe2\x80\x9d with the law.  <i>Free Enterprise Fund </i>v. <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477,\n505 (2010)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).

We first enforced that rule against an Act of Congress during the Reconstruction era in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Klein</i>, 13 Wall. 128 (1872).  <i>Klein</i> arose from congressional opposition to conciliation with the South, and in particular to the pardons Presidents Lincoln and Johnson had offered to former Confederate rebels.  See <i>id.,</i> at 140\xe2\x80\x93141; see, <i>e.g., </i>Presidential Proclamation No. 11,\n\n13Stat.\n737.  Although this Court had held that a pardon was proof of loyalty and entitled its holder to compensation in the Court of Claims for property seized by Union forces during the war, see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Padelford</i>, 9 Wall. 531, 543 (1870), the Radical Republican Congress wished to prevent pardoned rebels from obtaining such compensation.  It therefore enacted a law prohibiting claimants from using a pardon as evidence of loyalty, instead requiring the Court of Claims and Supreme Court to dismiss for want of jurisdiction any suit based on a pardon. <i> </i>See Act of July 12, 1870, ch. 251,\n\n16Stat.\n235; see also <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sioux Nation</i>,\n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,\n403 (1980)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Klein\xe2\x80\x99s suit was among those Congress wished to block.  Klein represented the estate of one V. F. Wilson, a Confederate supporter whom Lincoln had pardoned.  On behalf of the estate, Klein had obtained a sizable judg-ment in the Court of Claims for property seized by the Union. <i> Klein</i>, 13 Wall., at 132\xe2\x80\x93134.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from that judgment was pending in the Supreme Court when the law targeting such suits took effect.  The Government accordingly moved to dismiss the entire proceeding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court, however, denied that motion and instead declared the law unconstitutional.  It held that the law \xe2\x80\x9cpassed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 147.  The Court acknowledged that Congress may \xe2\x80\x9cmake exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power,\xe2\x80\x9d but it refused to sustain the law as an exercise of that authority.  <i>Id.,</i> at 146.  Instead, the Court held that the law violated the separation of powers by attempting to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide\xe2\x80\x9d the case by \xe2\x80\x9cprescrib[ing] rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 145\xe2\x80\x93146.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is of vital importance,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court stressed, that the legislative and judicial powers \xe2\x80\x9cbe kept distinct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority characterizes <i>Klein</i> as a delphic, puzzling decision whose central holding\xe2\x80\x94that Congress may not prescribe the result in pending cases\xe2\x80\x94cannot be taken at face value.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  It is true that <i>Klein </i>can be read too broadly, in a way that would swallow the rule that courts generally must apply a retroactively applicable statute to pending cases.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Schooner Peggy</i>, 1 Cranch 103, 110 (1801).  But <i>Schooner Peggy </i>can be read too broadly, too.  Applying a retroactive law that says \xe2\x80\x9cSmith wins\xe2\x80\x9d to the pending case of <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Jones</i> implicates profound issues of separation of powers, issues not adequately answered by a citation to <i>Schooner Peggy</i>.  And just because <i>Klein </i>did not set forth clear rules defining the limits on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to legislate with respect to a pending case does not mean\xe2\x80\x94as the majority seems to think\xe2\x80\x94that Article III itself imposes no such limits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same \xe2\x80\x9crecord of history\xe2\x80\x9d that drove the Framers to adopt Article III to implement the separation of powers ought to compel us to give meaning to their design.  <i>Plaut</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218.  The nearly two centuries of experience with legislative assumption of judicial power meant that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Framers were well acquainted with the danger of subjecting the determination of the rights of one person to the tyranny of shifting majorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>INS </i>v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919,\n961 (1983)\n (Powell, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Article III vested the judicial power in the Judiciary alone to protect against that threat to liberty.  It defined not only what the Judiciary can do, but also what Congress cannot.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court says it would reject a law that says \xe2\x80\x9cSmith wins\xe2\x80\x9d because such a statute \xe2\x80\x9cwould create no new substantive law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at<i> </i>12, n.\xc2\xa017.  Of course it would: Prior to the passage of the hypothetical statute, the law did not provide that Smith wins.  After the passage of the law, it does.  Changing the law is simply how Congress acts.  The question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power.  Saying Congress \xe2\x80\x9ccreates new law\xe2\x80\x9d in one case but not another simply expresses a conclusion on that issue; it does not supply a reason.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cSmith wins\xe2\x80\x9d is a new law, tailored to one case in the same way as \xc2\xa78772 and having the same effect.  All that both statutes \xe2\x80\x9ceffectuat[e],\xe2\x80\x9d in substance, is lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy judgment\xe2\x80\x9d that one side in one case ought to prevail.  <i>Ante,</i> at 18.  The cause for concern is that though the statutes are indistinguishable, it is plain that the majority recognizes no limit under the separation of powers beyond the prohibition on statutes as brazen as \xe2\x80\x9cSmith wins.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hamilton warned that the Judiciary must take \xe2\x80\x9call possible care .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defend itself against [the] attacks\xe2\x80\x9d of the other branches.  The Federalist No. 78, at 466.  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, however, Article III is but a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith\xe2\x80\x99s victory, without saying \xe2\x80\x9cSmith wins.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take the majority\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xc2\xa78772 left \xe2\x80\x9cplenty\xe2\x80\x9d of factual determinations for the court \xe2\x80\x9cto adjudicate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at<i> </i>16\xe2\x80\x9317, and n.\xc2\xa020 (internal quotation marks omitted).  All \xc2\xa78772 actually required of the court was two factual determinations\xe2\x80\x94that Bank Markazi has an equitable or beneficial interest in the assets, and that no other party does, \xc2\xa78772(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94both of which were well established by the time Congress enacted \xc2\xa78772.  Not only had the assets at issue been frozen pursuant to an Executive Order blocking \xe2\x80\x9cproperty of the Government of Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d Exec. Order No. 13599, 77 Fed. Reg. 6659 (2012), but the Bank had \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly insisted that it is the sole beneficial owner of the Blocked Assets,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a.  By that measure of \xe2\x80\x9cplenty,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority would have to uphold a law directing judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was duly served with notice of the proceedings, and that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claim was within the statute of limitations.  In reality, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplenty\xe2\x80\x9d is plenty of nothing, and, apparently, nothing is plenty for the Court.  See D. Heyward &amp; I. Gershwin,<i> </i>Porgy and Bess: Libretto 28 (1958).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that some of the precedents cited by the majority, <i>ante, </i>at 17\xe2\x80\x9319, have allowed Congress to approach the boundary between legislative and judicial power.  None, however, involved statutes comparable to \xc2\xa78772.  In <i>Robertson </i>v. <i>Seattle Audubon Soc.</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 429 (1992)\n, for example, the statute at issue referenced particular cases only as a shorthand for describing certain environmental law requirements, <i>id.,</i> at 433\xe2\x80\x93435, not to limit the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effect to those cases alone.  And in <i>Plaut</i>, the Court explicitly distinguished the statute before it\xe2\x80\x94which directed courts to reopen final judgments in an entire class of cases\xe2\x80\x94from one that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98single[s] out\xe2\x80\x99 any defendant for adverse treatment (or any plaintiff for favorable treatment).\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 238.  <i>Plaut</i>, in any event, held the statute before it <i>invalid</i>, concluding that it violated Article III based on the same historical understanding of the judicial power outlined above.  <i>Id.,</i> at 219\xe2\x80\x93225, 240.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I readily concede, without embarrassment, that it can sometimes be difficult to draw the line between legislative and judicial power.  That should come as no surprise; Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s admonition \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x98it is a <i>constitution</i> we are expounding\xe2\x80\x99 is especially relevant when the Court is required to give legal sanctions to an underlying principle of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94that of separation of powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </i>v. <i>Sawyer</i>,\n\n343 U.\xc2\xa0S. 579\n\xe2\x80\x93597 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (quoting <i>McCulloch </i>v. <i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819)).  But however difficult it may be to discern the line between the Legislative and Judicial Branches, the entire constitu-tional enterprise depends on there <i>being </i>such a line.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to enforce that boundary in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere \xe2\x80\x9cparchment barrier[\xc2\xa0] against the encroaching spirit\xe2\x80\x9d of legislative power.  The Federalist No. 48, at 308 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the majority suggests that \xc2\xa78772 is analogous to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s historical power to recognize foreign state sovereign immunity on a case-by-case basis.  As discussed above, however, \xc2\xa78772 does considerably more than withdraw the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign immunity.  <i>Supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  It strips the Bank of any protection that federal common law, international law, or New York State law might have offered against respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  That is without analogue or precedent.  In any event, the practice of applying case-specific Executive submissions on sovereign immunity was not judicial acquiescence in an intrusion on the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s role.  It was instead the result of substantive sovereign immunity law, developed and applied by the courts, which treated such a submission as a dispositive fact.  See <i>Verlinden B. V. </i>v. <i>Central Bank of Nigeria</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 480\n\xe2\x80\x93487 (1983);<i> Ex parte Peru</i>,\n\n318 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578\n\xe2\x80\x93588 (1943).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also compares \xc2\xa78772 to the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 authority to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise[\xc2\xa0] control over claims against foreign states and the disposition of foreign-state property in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 21 (citing <i>Dames &amp; Moore </i>v. <i>Regan</i>,\n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 654 (1981)\n).

We held that the President had that power, based on a combination of statutory authorization, congressional acquiescence, and inherent Executive power.  See <i>id.,</i> at 674\xe2\x80\x93675, 686.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority suggests that <i>Dames &amp; Moore</i> supports the validity of \xc2\xa78772.

For starters, the executive action <i>Dames &amp; Moore </i>upheld did not dictate how particular claims were to be resolved, but simply required such claims to be submitted to a different tribunal.  453 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 660.<i> </i>Furthermore, <i>Dames &amp; Moore</i> sanctioned that action based on the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding\xe2\x80\x9d practice of \xe2\x80\x9csettl[ing] the claims of [U.\xc2\xa0S.] nationals against foreign countries\xe2\x80\x9d by treaty or executive agreement.  <i>Id.</i>, at 679.<i> </i>The Court emphasized that throughout our history, the political branches have at times \xe2\x80\x9cdisposed of the claims of [U.\xc2\xa0S.] citizens without their consent, or even without consultation with them,\xe2\x80\x9d by renouncing claims, settling them, or establishing arbitration proceedings.  <i>Id.</i>, at 679\xe2\x80\x93681<i> </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).  Those dispositions, crucially, were not exercises of judicial power, as is evident from the fact that the Judiciary lacks authority to order settlement or establish new tribunals.  That is why <i>Klein </i>was not at issue in <i>Dames &amp; Moore</i>.  By contrast, no comparable history sustains Congress\xe2\x80\x99s action here, which seeks to provide relief to respondents not by transferring their claims in a manner only the political branches could do, but by commandeering the courts to make a political judgment look like a judicial one.  See <i>Medell\xc3\xadn </i>v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 491,\n531 (2008)\n (refusing to extend the President\xe2\x80\x99s claims-settlement authority beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow set of circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d defined by the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <i>Dames &amp; Moore</i>, 453 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 686)).</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If anything, what <i>Dames &amp; Moore </i>reveals is that the political branches have extensive powers of their own in this area and could have chosen to exercise them to give relief to the claimants in this case.
