Jos\xc3\xa9 moved to the Dominican Republic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to satisfy \xc2\xa71401(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of five years\xe2\x80\x99 physical presence after age 14.  There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave birth to Morales-Santana.  Jos\xc3\xa9 accepted parental responsibility and included Morales-Santana in his household; he married Morales-Santana\xe2\x80\x99s mother and his name was then added to hers on Morales-Santana\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate.  In 2000, the Government sought to remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions, ranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement of five years\xe2\x80\x99 physical presence after age 14.  An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship claim and ordered his removal.  Morales-Santana later moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from his U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen father violated the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection guarantee.  The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second Circuit reversed.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s post-1970 construction of the equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed mothers and fathers.  To cure this infirmity, the Court of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his mother the U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Government accord to all persons \xe2\x80\x9cthe equal protection of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Morales-Santana satisfies the requirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his father\xe2\x80\x99s right to equal protection.

In the 1940 Act, Congress codified the mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.  According to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified for unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have scant contact with, their nonmarital children.  Unwed citizen mothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father, along with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0For close to a half century, this Court has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on \xe2\x80\x9coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Virginia</i>, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 533.  No \xe2\x80\x9cimportant [governmental] interest\xe2\x80\x9d is served by laws grounded, as \xc2\xa71409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that \xe2\x80\x9cunwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than mothers\xe2\x80\x9d to take responsibility for nonmarital children.  <i>Caban</i> v. <i>Mohammed</i>,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 380\n.  In light of this equal protection jurisprudence, \xc2\xa71409(a) and (c)\xe2\x80\x99s discrete duration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are anachronistic.

But <i>Fiallo</i> involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not present a claim of U.\xc2\xa0S. citizenship.  And <i>Miller</i> and <i>Nguyen</i> addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well met here, not the length of a parent\xe2\x80\x99s prebirth residency in the United States.

Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0The Government asserts that Congress sought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection to the United States.  The statute, the Government suggests, bracketed an unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mother with a married couple in which both parents are U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens because she is the only legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a citizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national influence of the alien mother.  This rationale conforms to the long-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.  And the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested congressional interest.  Citizenship may be transmitted to children who have no tie to the United States so long as their U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United States for one year at any point in her life <i>prior</i> to the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting \xc2\xa71401(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he acknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the child in the United States.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Government also maintains that Congress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the foreign-born child of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.  But congressional hearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a statelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence requirements.  Nor has the Government shown that the risk of statelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Because this Court is not equipped to convert \xc2\xa71409(c)\xe2\x80\x99s exception for unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers into the main rule displacing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to Congress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any person on the basis of gender.  In the interim, \xc2\xa71401(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to children born to unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers.  The legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs the choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending favorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable treatment from the favored class.  Ordinarily, the preferred rule is to extend favorable treatment.  <i>Westcott</i>, 443 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89\xe2\x80\x9390.  Here, however, extension to fathers of \xc2\xa71409(c)\xe2\x80\x99s favorable treatment for mothers would displace Congress\xe2\x80\x99 general rule, the longer physical-presence requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(a)(7) and 1409 applicable to unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen fathers and U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the child\xe2\x80\x99s alien parent.

The main rule appears in 8\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now \xc2\xa71401(g) (2012 ed.).  Applicable to married couples, \xc2\xa71401(a)(7) requires a period of physical presence in the United States for the U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen parent.  The requirement, as initially prescribed, was ten years\xe2\x80\x99 physical presence prior to the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth, \xc2\xa7601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years prebirth, \xc2\xa71401(g) (2012 ed.).  That main rule is rendered applicable to unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen fathers by \xc2\xa71409(a).  Congress ordered an exception, however, for unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers.  Contained in \xc2\xa71409(c), the exception allows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born abroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year prior to the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The respondent in this case, Luis Ram\xc3\xb3n Morales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father was just 20 days short of meeting \xc2\xa71401(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s physical-presence requirement.  Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic, Morales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle implicit in the\n \nFifth Amendment[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] entitles him to citizenship stature.  We hold that the gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that the Government accord to all persons \xe2\x80\x9cthe equal protection of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nevertheless, we cannot convert \xc2\xa71409(c)\xe2\x80\x99s exception for unwed mothers into the main rule displacing \xc2\xa71401(a)(7) (covering married couples) and \xc2\xa71409(a) (covering unwed fathers).  We must therefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a physical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other period) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed.  In the interim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are administered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We first describe in greater detail the regime Congress constructed.  The general rules for acquiring U.\xc2\xa0S. citizenship are found in\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71401, the first section in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act (1952 Act or INA), \xc2\xa7301,\n\n66Stat.\n235\xe2\x80\x93236.  Section 1401 sets forth the INA\xe2\x80\x99s rules for determining who \xe2\x80\x9cshall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth\xe2\x80\x9d by establishing a range of residency and physical-presence requirements calibrated primarily to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 nationality and the child\xe2\x80\x99s place of birth.  \xc2\xa71401(a) (1958 ed.); \xc2\xa71401 (2012 ed.).  The primacy of \xc2\xa71401 in the statutory scheme is evident.  Comprehensive in coverage, \xc2\xa71401 provides the general framework for the acquisition of citizenship at birth.  In particular, at the time relevant here,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] \xc2\xa71401(a)(7) provided for the U.\xc2\xa0S. citizenship of</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9ca person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: <i>Provided</i>, That any periods of honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included in computing the physical presence requirements of this paragraph.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress has since reduced the duration requirement to five years, two after age 14.  \xc2\xa71401(g) (2012 ed.).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1409 pertains specifically to children with unmarried parents.  Its first subsection, \xc2\xa71409(a), incorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of \xc2\xa71401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to transmit U.\xc2\xa0S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the same terms as a married citizen parent.  Section 1409(c)\xe2\x80\x94a provision applicable only to unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers\xe2\x80\x94states an exception to the physical-presence requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401 and 1409(a).

Unwed fathers and their children, asserting their right to equal protection, sought the same preferences.  <i>Id.</i>, at 791.  Applying minimal scrutiny (rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cexceptionally broad power\xe2\x80\x9d to admit or exclude aliens.  <i>Id.</i>, at 792, 794.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>]  This case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.  Morales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen.  Examining a claim of that order, the Court has not disclaimed, as it did in <i>Fiallo</i>, the application of an exacting standard of review.  See <i>Nguyen</i>, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 60\xe2\x80\x9361, 70; <i>Miller</i>, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 434\xe2\x80\x93435, n.\xc2\xa011 (opinion of Stevens, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The provision challenged in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Nguyen</i> as violative of equal protection requires unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen fathers, but not mothers, to formally acknowledge parenthood of their foreign-born children in order to transmit their U.\xc2\xa0S. citizenship to those children.  See \xc2\xa71409(a)(4) (2012 ed.).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>]  After <i>Miller</i> produced no opinion for the Court, see 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 423, we took up the issue anew in <i>Nguyen</i>.  There, the Court held that imposing a paternal-acknowledgment requirement on fathers was a justifiable, easily met means of ensuring the existence of a biological parent-child relationship, which the mother establishes by giving birth.  See 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363.

And unlike <i>Nguyen</i>\xe2\x80\x99s parental-acknowledgment requirement, \xc2\xa71409(a)\xe2\x80\x99s age-calibrated physical-presence requirements cannot fairly be described as \xe2\x80\x9cminimal.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 70.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Notwithstanding \xc2\xa71409(a) and (c)\xe2\x80\x99s provenance in traditional notions of the way women and men are, the Government maintains that the statute serves two important objectives: (1) ensuring a connection between the child to become a citizen and the United States and (2) preventing \xe2\x80\x9cstatelessness,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e.</i>, a child\xe2\x80\x99s possession of no citizenship at all.  Even indulging the assumption that Congress intended \xc2\xa71409 to serve these interests, but see <i>supra</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9313, neither rationale survives heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We take up first the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xc2\xa71409(a) and (c)\xe2\x80\x99s gender-based differential ensures that a child born abroad has a connection to the United States of sufficient strength to warrant conferral of citizenship at birth.  The Government does not contend, nor could it, that unmarried men take more time to absorb U.\xc2\xa0S. values than unmarried women do.  See <i>supra</i>, at 16.  Instead, it presents a novel argument, one it did not advance in <i>Flores-Villar</i>.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An unwed mother, the Government urges, is the child\xe2\x80\x99s only \xe2\x80\x9clegally recognized\xe2\x80\x9d parent at the time of childbirth.  Brief for Petitioner 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 28\xe2\x80\x9332.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>]  An unwed citizen father enters the scene later, as a second parent.  A longer physical connection to the United States is warranted for the unwed father, the Government maintains, because of the \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting national influence\xe2\x80\x9d of the alien mother.  <i>Id.</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Congress, the Government suggests, designed the statute to bracket an unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mother with a married couple in which both parents are U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens,[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>] and to align an unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a citizen, the other, an alien.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Underlying this apparent design is the assumption that the alien father of a nonmarital child born abroad to a U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mother will not accept parental responsibility.  For an actual affiliation between alien father and nonmarital child would create the \xe2\x80\x9ccompeting national influence\xe2\x80\x9d that, according to the Government, justifies imposing on unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen fathers, but not unwed U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen mothers, lengthy physical-presence requirements.  Hardly gender neutral, see <i>id.</i>, at 9, that assumption conforms to the long-held view that unwed fathers care little about, indeed are strangers to, their children.  See <i>supra</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9313.  Lump characterization of that kind, however, no longer passes equal protection inspection.  See <i>supra</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n.\xc2\xa013.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Accepting, <i>arguendo</i>, that Congress intended the diverse physical-presence prescriptions to serve an interest in ensuring a connection between the foreign-born nonmarital child and the United States, the gender-based means scarcely serve the posited end.  The scheme permits the transmission of citizenship to children who have no tie to the United States so long as their mother was a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen continuously present in the United States for one year at any point in her life <i>prior</i> to the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth.  The transmission holds even if the mother marries the child\xe2\x80\x99s alien father immediately after the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth and never returns with the child to the United States.  At the same time, the legislation precludes citizenship transmission by a U.\xc2\xa0S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting \xc2\xa71401(a)(7)\xe2\x80\x99s longer physical-presence requirements, even if the father acknowledges paternity on the day of the child\xe2\x80\x99s birth and raises the child in the United States.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]  One cannot see in this driven-by-gender scheme the close means-end fit required to survive heightened scrutiny.

I agree with that holding.  As the majority concludes, extending\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71409(c)\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year physical presence requirement to unwed citizen fathers (as respondent requests) is not, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, an appropriate remedy for any equal protection violation.  See <i>ante</i>, at 23.  Indeed, I am skeptical that we even have the \xe2\x80\x9cpower to provide relief of the sort requested in this suit\xe2\x80\x94namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tuan Anh Nguyen</i> v. <i>INS</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 53,\n73 (2001)\n (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring) (citing <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Albright</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420,\n452 (1998)\n (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial holding resolves this case.  Because respondent cannot obtain relief in any event, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the 1952 version of the INA was constitutional, whether respondent has third-party standing to raise an equal protection claim on behalf of his father, or whether other immigration laws (such as the current versions of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71401(g) and 1409) are constitu-tional.  I therefore concur only in the judgment reversing the Second Circuit.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
