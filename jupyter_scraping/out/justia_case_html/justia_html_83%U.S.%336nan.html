What was the understanding of the parties, or rather what understanding must naturally have been derived from the language used?  It seems to us that walking would not naturally be presented to the mind as a means of public or private conveyance.  Public conveyance naturally suggests a vessel or vehicle employed in the general conveyance of passengers.  Private conveyance suggests a vehicle belonging to a private individual.</p>\n<p>If this was the sense in which the language was understood by the parties, the deceased was not, when injured, traveling within the terms of the policy.  There is nothing to show that it was not.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
