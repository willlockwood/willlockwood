S. 93</a>, 203\xe2\x80\x93209, this Court upheld limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying on the holding in <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a>, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, released a documentary (hereinafter <em>Hillary</em>) critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party\xe2\x80\x99s Presidential nomination.  Anticipating that it would make <em>Hillary </em>available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast and cable television.  Concerned about possible civil and criminal penalties for violating \xc2\xa7441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that (1) \xc2\xa7441b is unconstitutional as applied to <em>Hillary;</em> and (2) BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements, BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to <em>Hillary </em>and the ads.  The District Court denied Citizens United a preliminary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC) summary judgment. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because the question whether \xc2\xa7441b applies to Hillary</em> cannot be resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech, this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in <em>Austin</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Citizen United\xe2\x80\x99s narrower arguments\xe2\x80\x94that <em>Hillary</em> is not an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>covered by \xc2\xa7441b because it is not \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly distributed\xe2\x80\x9d under 11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.29(a)(2); that \xc2\xa7441b may not be applied to <em>Hillary </em>under <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html">551 U. S. 449</a> <em>(WRTL), </em>which found \xc2\xa7441b unconstitutional as applied to speech that was not \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 481 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), determining that a communication \xe2\x80\x9cis the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93470; that \xc2\xa7441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand because this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads; and that there should be an exception to \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban for nonprofit corporate political speech funded overwhelming by individuals\xe2\x80\x94are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s meaning and purpose.  Citizens United did not waive this challenge to <em>Austin </em>when it stipulated to dismissing the facial challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived, this Court may reconsider <em>Austin </em>and \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s facial validity here because the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cpassed upon\xe2\x80\x9d the issue, <em>Lebron</em> v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/374/index.html">513 U. S. 374</a>, 379; (2) throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Because Citizen United\xe2\x80\x99s narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s facial validity.  Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide chilling effect caused by \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s corporate expenditure ban.  This conclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty caused by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position; (2) substantial time would be required to clarify \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s application on the points raised by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is of primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any speech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating political speech is chilled.  The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a prior restraint in the strict sense.  However, given its complexity and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak.  The restrictions thus function as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power analogous to the type of government practices that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.   The ongoing chill on speech makes it necessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0<em>Austin</em> is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.  Hence, \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be applied to <em>Hillary.</em>  Given this conclusion, the part of <em>McConnell</em> that upheld BCRA \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x99s extension of \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on independent corporate expenditures is also overruled.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Although the First Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law \xe2\x80\xa6 abridging the freedom of speech,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech, backed by criminal sanctions.  It is a ban notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a separate association from the corporation.  Because speech is an essential mechanism of democracy\xe2\x80\x94it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people\xe2\x80\x94political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it by design or inadvertence.  Laws burdening such speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \xe2\x80\x9cfurthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>WRTL, </em>551 U. S.,<em> </em>at 464.  This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting the interests in this case.  Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speakers, which may be a means to control content.  The Government may also commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.  There is no basis for the proposition that, in the political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.  Both history and logic lead to this conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to corporations, <em>e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political speech, see, <em>e.g., NAACP</em> v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U. S. 415</a>, 428\xe2\x80\x93429.  Addressing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the <em>Buckley</em> Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.  424 U. S., at 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  However, the Court invalidated \xc2\xa7608(e)\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals, corporations, and unions, because it \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  While <em>Buckley</em> did not consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures found in \xc2\xa7610, had that provision been challenged in <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and analysis.  The <em>Buckley </em>Court did not invoke the overbreadth doctrine to suggest that \xc2\xa7608(e)\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban would have been constitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not individuals.   Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified \xc2\xa7610\xe2\x80\x99s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b, the provision at issue.  Less than two years after <em>Buckley, Bellotti </em>reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the power to restrict political speech based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.  435 U.S., at 784\xe2\x80\x93785.  Thus the law stood until <em>Austin </em>upheld a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti </em>by recognizing a new governmental interest in preventing \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth \xe2\x80\xa6 that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 660.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-<em>Austin </em>line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity and a post-<em>Austin </em>line permitting them.  Neither <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale nor the Government\xe2\x80\x99s other justifications support \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions.  Pp.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9347.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political speech, but <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale would permit the Government to ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corporate form.  Political speech is \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti, supra,</em> at 777 (footnote omitted).  This protection is inconsistent with <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, which is meant to prevent corporations from obtaining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by using \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98resources amassed in the economic marketplace.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 659.  First Amendment protections do not depend on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 49.  These conclusions were reaffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  Distinguishing wealthy individuals from corporations based on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s special advantages of, <em>e.g., </em>limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting speech.  It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate funds may \xe2\x80\x9chave little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Austin, supra,</em> at 660.  All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the resulting speech.  Under the antidistortion rationale, Congress could also ban political speech of media corporations.  Although currently exempt from \xc2\xa7441b, they accumulate wealth with the help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth, and may express views \xe2\x80\x9chav[ing] little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support\xe2\x80\x9d for those views.  Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations cannot be squared with the First Amendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning would permit suppressing media corporations\xe2\x80\x99 political speech.  <em>Austin </em>interferes with the \xe2\x80\x9copen marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  <em>New York State Bd. of Elections</em> v. <em>Lopez Torres</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/196/index.html">552 U. S. 196</a>, 208.  Its censorship is vast in its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit, both small and large, corporations.  Pp.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments.  It reasons that corporate political speech can be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance.  The <em>Buckley </em>Court found this rationale \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d to allow contribution limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here.   While a single <em>Bellotti </em>footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  That speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt.  And the appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.  <em>Caperton</em> v. <em>A. T. Massey Coal Co.</em>, 556 U. S. ___, distinguished.

The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a dissenting shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s interests in certain media for 30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media at any time.  It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder.

Pp.\xc2\xa046\xe2\x80\x9347.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to <em>stare decisis, </em>beyond workability\xe2\x80\x94the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned\xe2\x80\x94counsel in favor of abandoning <em>Austin, </em>which itself contravened the precedents of <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Bellotti.  </em>As already explained, <em>Austin </em>was not well reasoned.  It is also undermined by experience since its announcement.  Political speech is so ingrained in this country\xe2\x80\x99s culture that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws.  Rapid changes in technology\xe2\x80\x94and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression\xe2\x80\x94counsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  In addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake.  Thus, due consideration leads to the conclusion that <em>Austin</em> should be overruled.   The Court returns to the principle established in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti</em> that the Government may not suppress political speech based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.  No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.

Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that \xc2\xa7311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that \xc2\xa7311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group\xe2\x80\x99s speech were rejected in <em>McConnell.</em>  This Court also rejects their contention that \xc2\xa7201\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under <em>WRTL\xe2\x80\x99</em>s test for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93476 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  Disclosure is the less-restrictive alternative to more comprehensive speech regulations.  Such requirements have been upheld in <em>Buckley </em>and <em>McConnell.  </em>Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s argument that no informational interest justifies applying \xc2\xa7201 to its ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to disclaimers.  Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no evidence that its<em> </em>members face the type of threats, harassment, or reprisals that might make \xc2\xa7201 unconstitutional as applied.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b.  Limits on electioneering communications were upheld in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>, 203\xe2\x80\x93209 (2003).  The holding of <em>McConnell</em> rested to a large extent on an earlier case, <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a> (1990).  <em>Austin </em>had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case we are asked to reconsider <em>Austin</em> and, in effect, <em>McConnell</em>.  It has been noted that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Austin</em> was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html">551 U.

We agree with that conclusion and hold that <em>stare decisis</em> does not compel the continued acceptance of <em>Austin</em>.  The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether.  We turn to the case now before us.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation.  It brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  A three-judge court later convened to hear the cause.  The resulting judgment gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12 million.  Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled <em>Hillary: The Movie</em>.  We refer to the film as <em>Hillary</em>.  It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 Presidential primary elections.<em>  Hillary</em> mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton.  <em>Hillary</em> was released in theaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by making it available through video-on-demand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select programming from various menus, including movies, television shows, sports, news, and music.  The viewer can watch the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause the program.  In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make <em>Hillary</em> available on a video-on-demand channel called \xe2\x80\x9cElections \xe2\x80\x9908.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 255a\xe2\x80\x93257a.  Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small fee to view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make <em>Hillary</em> available to viewers free of charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for <em>Hillary</em>.  Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie\xe2\x80\x99s Website address.  <em>Id.</em>, at 26a\xe2\x80\x9327a.

An electioneering communication is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\xe2\x80\x9d and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.  \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A).  The Federal Election Commission\xe2\x80\x99s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a communication that is \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly distributed.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.29(a)(2) (2009).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of a candidate for nomination for President \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>publicly distributed</em> means\xe2\x80\x9d that the communication \xe2\x80\x9c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within 30 days.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7100.29(b)(3)(ii).  Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering communications.  They may establish, however, a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate segregated fund\xe2\x80\x9d (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2).  The moneys received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United wanted to make Hillary</em> available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections.  It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban on corporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under \xc2\xa7437g.  In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC.  It argued that (1) \xc2\xa7441b is unconstitutional as applied to <em>Hillary;</em> and (2) BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to <em>Hillary</em> and to the three ads for the movie.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court denied Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F.

See <em>id.</em>, at 261a (\xe2\x80\x9cBased on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that the [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <em>See Citizen[s] United v.

The court held that \xc2\xa7441b was facially constitutional under <em>McConnell</em>, and that \xc2\xa7441b was constitutional as applied to <em>Hillary </em>because it was \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 F.

It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though the speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 281.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We noted probable jurisdiction.  555 U. S. ___ (2008).  The case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether we should overrule either or both <em>Austin</em> and the part of <em>McConnell</em> which addresses the facial validity of 2 U.

Citizens United raises this issue for the first time before us, but we consider the issue because \xe2\x80\x9cit was addressed by the court below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lebron</em> v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/374/index.html">513 U. S. 374</a>, 379 (1995); see 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 277, n.\xc2\xa06.  Under the definition of electioneering communication, the video-on-demand showing of <em>Hillary</em> on cable television would have been a \xe2\x80\x9ccable . . . communication\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9crefer[red] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\xe2\x80\x9d and that was made within 30 days of a primary election.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A)(i).  Citizens United, however, argues that <em>Hillary</em> was not \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly distributed,\xe2\x80\x9d because a single video-on-demand transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each separate transmission, in most instances, will be seen by just one household\xe2\x80\x94not 50,000 or more persons.  11 CFR \xc2\xa7100.29(a)(2); see \xc2\xa7100.29(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument ignores the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s instruction on how to determine whether a cable transmission \xe2\x80\x9c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7100.29(b)(3)(ii).  The regulation provides that the number of people who can receive a cable transmission is determined by the number of cable subscribers in the relevant area.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii).  Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide.  App. 256a.  Thus, <em>Hillary</em> could have been received by 50,000 persons or more.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One <em>amici </em>brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the condition that the communication \xe2\x80\x9c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require \xe2\x80\x9ca plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed by 50,000 or more potential voters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to requiring only that the communication is \xe2\x80\x9ctechnologically capable\xe2\x80\x9d of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5.  Whether the population and demographic statistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000 registered voters\xe2\x80\x94but not \xe2\x80\x9cinfants, pre-teens, or otherwise electorally ineligible recipients\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would be a required determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in any case where the issue was in doubt.  <em>Id.</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the reach of 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b through this suggested interpretation.  In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this result would require a calculation as to the number of people a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker to criminal sanctions.  The First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day.  Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech: People \xe2\x80\x9cof common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the law\xe2\x80\x99s] meaning and differ as to its application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connally</em> v. <em>General Constr. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/269/385/index.html">269 U. S. 385</a>, 391 (1926).  The Government may not render a ban on political speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption through an amorphous regulatory interpretation.  We must reject the approach suggested by the <em>amici</em>.  Section 441b covers <em>Hillary</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United next argues that \xc2\xa7441b may not be applied to <em>Hillary</em> under the approach taken in <em>WRTL</em>.  <em>McConnell</em> decided that \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d was facially constitutional insofar as it restricted speech that was \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of express advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d for or against a specific candidate.  540 U. S., at 206.  <em>WRTL</em> then found an unconstitutional application of \xc2\xa7441b where the speech was not \xe2\x80\x9cexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 481 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  As explained by The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s controlling opinion in <em>WRTL</em>, the functional-equivalent test is objective: \xe2\x80\x9ca court should find that [a communication] is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 469\xe2\x80\x93470.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this test, <em>Hillary</em> is equivalent to express advocacy.  The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President.  In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by most viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s character and her fitness for the office of the Presidency.  The narrative may contain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is unfit for the Presidency.  The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration, Senator Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications and fitness for office, and policies the commentators predict she would pursue if elected President.  It calls Senator Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cMachiavellian,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 64a, and asks whether she is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most qualified to hit the ground running if elected President,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 88a.  The narrator reminds viewers that \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans have never been keen on dynasties\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ca vote for Hillary is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 143a\xe2\x80\x93144a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United argues that <em>Hillary</em> is just \xe2\x80\x9ca documentary film that examines certain historical events.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant 35.  We disagree.  The movie\xe2\x80\x99s consistent emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy for President.  The narrator begins by asking \xe2\x80\x9ccould [Senator Clinton] become the first female President in the history of the United States?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 35a.  And the narrator reiterates the movie\xe2\x80\x99s message in his closing line: \xe2\x80\x9cFinally, before America decides on our next president, voters should need no reminders of \xe2\x80\xa6 what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake\xe2\x80\x94the well being and prosperity of our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 144a\xe2\x80\x93145a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the District Court found, there is no reasonable interpretation of <em>Hillary</em> other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton.  Under the standard stated in <em>McConnell</em> and further elaborated in <em>WRTL</em>, the film qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United further contends that \xc2\xa7441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra</em>, at 207.  On what we might call conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated to the advertising.  With video-on-demand, by contrast, the viewer selects a program after taking \xe2\x80\x9ca series of affirmative steps\xe2\x80\x9d: subscribing to cable; navigating through various menus; and selecting the program.  See <em>Reno</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/844/index.html">521 U. S. 844</a>, 867 (1997).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While some means of communication may be less effective than others at influencing the public in different contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of communications are to be preferred for the particular type of message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts\xe2\x80\x99 own lawful authority.  Substantial questions would arise if courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be preferred or disfavored.  And in all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid flux.  See <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a>, 639 (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment.  We must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.  It must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First Amendment flaws.  The interpretive process itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable.  First Amendment standards, however, \xe2\x80\x9cmust give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (citing <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html"></a><a href="/us/376/254/index.html">376 U.

S., at 209.  <em>McConnell </em>then interpreted the Wellstone Amendment to retain the <em>MCFL</em> exemption to \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure prohibition.  540 U. S., at 211.  Citizens United does not qualify for the <em>MCFL</em> exemption, however, since some funds used to make the movie were donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government suggests we could find BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s Wellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the statute, and hold that Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s speech is exempt from \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban under BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, \xc2\xa7441b(c)(2).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (Sept. 9, 2009).  The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a backup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone Amendment is invalidated.  See <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 339 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would exempt from \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban the political speech of certain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively\xe2\x80\x9d by individual donors and the funds were maintained in a segregated account.  \xc2\xa7441b(c)(2).  Citizens United would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemption, under its terms as written, because <em>Hillary</em> was funded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argument, the Court would be required to revise the text of <em>MCFL</em>, sever BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s Wellstone Amendment, \xc2\xa7441b(c)(6), and ignore the plain text of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, \xc2\xa7441b(c)(2).  If the Court decided to create a <em>de minimis</em> exception to <em>MCFL</em> or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corporate general treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that support candidates.  There is no principled basis for doing this without rewriting <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view of the language of the statute.  In addition to those difficulties the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion is troubling for still another reason.  The Government does not say that it agrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 3, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cSome courts\xe2\x80\x9d have implied a <em>de minimis </em>exception, and \xe2\x80\x9cappellant would appear to be covered by these decisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  Presumably it would find textual difficulties in this approach too.  The Government, like any party, can make arguments in the alternative; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative proposal instead of merely suggesting it.  This is especially true in the context of the First Amendment.  As the Government stated, this case \xe2\x80\x9cwould require a remand\xe2\x80\x9d to apply a <em>de minimis </em>standard.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9, 2009).  Applying this standard would thus require case-by-case determinations.  But archetypical political speech would be chilled in the meantime.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 468\xe2\x80\x93469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (quoting <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Button</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/index.html">371 U. S. 415</a>, 433 (1963)).  We decline to adopt an interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case determinations to verify whether political speech is banned, especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment.  See <em>Morse</em> v. <em>Frederick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/393/index.html">551 U. S. 393</a>, 403 (2007).  It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications.  Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling.  Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consideration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in <em>Austin</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its complaint, which raised a facial challenge to \xc2\xa7441b, even though count 3 raised an as-applied challenge.  See App. 23a (count 3: \xe2\x80\x9cAs applied to <em>Hillary</em>, [\xc2\xa7441b] is unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free expression and association\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government argues that Citizens United waived its challenge to <em>Austin</em> by dismissing count 5.  We disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that would not prevent the Court from reconsidering <em>Austin</em> or addressing the facial validity of \xc2\xa7441b in this case.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur practice \xe2\x80\x98permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has been passed upon . . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lebron</em>, 513 U. S., at 379 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/36/index.html">504 U. S. 36</a>, 41 (1992); first alteration in original).  And here, the District Court addressed Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s facial challenge.  See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (\xe2\x80\x9cCitizens wants us to enjoin the operation of BCRA \xc2\xa7203 as a facially unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d).  In rejecting the claim, it noted that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have to overrule <em>McConnell</em>\xe2\x80\x9d for Citizens United to prevail on its facial challenge and that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly the Supreme Court may overrule its decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 484 (1989)).  The District Court did not provide much analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in <em>Austin </em>or <em>McConnell</em>.  Even so, the District Court did \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pas[s] upon\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the issue.  <em>Lebron</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 379.  Furthermore, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s later opinion, which granted the FEC summary judgment, was \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ased on the reasoning of [its] prior opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d which included the discussion of the facial challenge.  App. 261a (citing 530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 274).  After the District Court addressed the facial validity of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to <em>Austin</em> in this Court.  See Brief for Appellant 30 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Austin</em> was wrongly decided and should be overruled\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9332.  In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to <em>Austin </em>and the facial validity of \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.  All concede that this claim is properly before us.  And \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lebron</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 379 (quoting <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 534 (1992); alteration in original).  Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Austin </em>should be overruled is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a new claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lebron, </em>513 U. S., at 379.  Rather, it is\xe2\x80\x94at most\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca new argument to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge.  The distinction is both instructive and necessary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Treasury Employees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/454/index.html">513 U. S. 454</a>, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (1995) (contrasting \xe2\x80\x9ca facial challenge\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ca narrower remedy\xe2\x80\x9d).  The parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Citizens United has preserved its First Amendment challenge to \xc2\xa7441b as applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we cannot easily address that issue without assuming a premise\xe2\x80\x94the permissibility of restricting corporate political speech\xe2\x80\x94that is itself in doubt.  See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce a case is brought, no general categorical line bars a court from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99 cases\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 1327\xe2\x80\x931328.  As our request for supplemental briefing implied, Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claim implicates the validity of <em>Austin</em>, which in turn implicates the facial validity of \xc2\xa7441b.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the statute now at issue came before the Court in <em>McConnell</em>, both the majority and the dissenting opinions considered the question of its facial validity.  The holding and validity of <em>Austin</em> were essential to the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> majority opinion, which upheld BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s extension of \xc2\xa7441b.  See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin, </em>494 U. S.<em>,</em> at 660).  <em>McConnell</em> permitted federal felony punishment for speech by all corporations, including nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elections.  See 540 U. S.<em>,</em> at 203\xe2\x80\x93209.  Four Members of the <em>McConnell</em> Court would have overruled <em>Austin</em>, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Austin </em>but reconsidered that conclusion.  See 540 U. S., at 256\xe2\x80\x93262 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 273\xe2\x80\x93275 (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 322\xe2\x80\x93338 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, J.).  That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was facilitated by the extensive record, which was \xe2\x80\x9cover 100,000 pages\xe2\x80\x9d long, made in the three-judge District Court.  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) <em>(per curiam) (McConnell I)</em>.  It is not the case, then, that the Court today is premature in interpreting \xc2\xa7441b \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on the basis of [a] factually barebones recor[d].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html">552 U. S. 442</a>, 450 (2008) (quoting <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 609 (2004)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>McConnell</em> majority considered whether the statute was facially invalid.  An as-applied challenge was brought in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/410/index.html">546 U. S. 410</a>, 411\xe2\x80\x93412 (2006) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and the Court confirmed that the challenge could be maintained.  Then, in <em>WRTL</em>, the controlling opinion of the Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but  also sustained it.  Three Justices noted that they would continue to maintain the position that the record in <em>McConnell</em> demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its face.  551 U. S., at 485\xe2\x80\x93504 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The controlling opinion in <em>WRTL</em>, which refrained from holding the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the essential elements of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>McConnell</em>, while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made by the <em>WRTL</em> parties.  551 U. S.<em>,</em> at 482 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted above, Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute.  In the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for the Court to consider the facial validity of \xc2\xa7441b.  Any other course of decision would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions on corporate expenditures.  Consideration of the facial validity of \xc2\xa7441b is further supported by the following reasons.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position of the Government.  As discussed above, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93D, <em>supra</em>, the Government suggests, as an alternative argument, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.  This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit corporation involved here may have received only <em>de minimis</em> donations from for-profit corporations and that some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the operation of the statute.  The Government also suggests that an as-applied challenge to \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban on books may be successful, although it would defend \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban as applied to almost every other form of media including pamphlets.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65\xe2\x80\x9366 (Sept. 9, 2009).  The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to the uncertainty that \xc2\xa7441b causes.  When the Government holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity to the application of the statutory provision on these points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by some improper interpretation.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>supra</em>.  It is well known that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks immediately before they are held.  There are short timeframes in which speech can have influence.  The need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this stage in the campaign.  The decision to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others.  A speaker\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit.  By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 462 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (citing <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U. S. 95</a>, 109 (1983); <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co.</em> v. <em>ICC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/219/498/index.html">219 U. S. 498</a>, 515 (1911)).  Here, Citizens United decided to litigate its case to the end.  Today, Citizens United finally learns, two years after the fact, whether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential primary\xe2\x80\x94long after the opportunity to persuade primary voters has passed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the integrity of the election process.  As additional rules are created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably within their reach is chilled.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>.  Campaign finance regulations now impose \xe2\x80\x9cunique and complex rules\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9c71 distinct entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different types of political speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, n.\xc2\xa010.  The FEC has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanations and justifications for those regulations, and 1,771 advisory opinions since 1975.  See <em>id.</em>, at 6, n.\xc2\xa07.  In fact, after this Court in <em>WRTL</em> adopted an objective \xe2\x80\x9cappeal to vote\xe2\x80\x9d test for determining whether a communication was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), the FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement <em>WRTL</em>\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  See 11 CFR \xc2\xa7114.15; Brief for Wyoming Liberty Group et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17\xe2\x80\x9327 (filed Jan. 15, 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place.  Cf. <em>Near</em> v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/697/index.html">283 U. S. 697</a>, 712\xe2\x80\x93713 (1931).  As a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the regulations and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437f; 11 CFR \xc2\xa7112.1.  These onerous restrictions thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.  See <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Chicago Park Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/316/index.html">534 U. S. 316</a>, 320 (2002); <em>Lovell</em> v. <em>City of Griffin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/303/444/index.html">303 U. S. 444</a>, 451\xe2\x80\x93452 (1938); <em>Near</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 713\xe2\x80\x93714.  Because the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness is to censor, there inheres the danger that [it] may well be less responsive than a court\xe2\x80\x94part of an independent branch of government\xe2\x80\x94to the constitutionally protected interests in free expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/index.html">380 U. S. 51</a>, 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (1965).  When the FEC issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speech\xe2\x80\x94harming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/113/index.html">539 U. S. 113</a>, 119 (2003) (citation omitted).  Consequently, \xe2\x80\x9cthe censor\xe2\x80\x99s determination may in practice be final.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freedman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 58.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is precisely what <em>WRTL</em> sought to avoid.  <em>WRTL</em> said that First Amendment standards \xe2\x80\x9cmust eschew \xe2\x80\x98the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,\xe2\x80\x99 which \xe2\x80\x98invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (quoting <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/527/index.html">513 U. S. 527</a>, 547 (1995); alteration in original).  Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests.  If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question.  Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have promulgated.  This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of speech.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.  See <em>WRTL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 482\xe2\x80\x93483 (Alito, J., concurring); <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/310/88/index.html">310 U.

For these reasons we find it necessary to reconsider <em>Austin</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law \xe2\x80\xa6 abridging the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Laws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process.

S. 150</a>, 153 (2002); imposing a burden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties, <em>Simon &amp; Schuster</em>, <em>Inc.</em> v. <em>Members of N.\xc2\xa0Y. State Crime Victims Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/105/index.html"></a><a href="/us/502/105/index.html">502 U. S. 105</a>, 108, 123 (1991); seeking to exact a cost after the speech occurs, <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, 376 U. S., at 267; and subjecting the speaker to criminal penalties, <em>Brandenburg</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/444/index.html">395 U. S. 444</a>, 445 (1969) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.  Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations\xe2\x80\x94including nonprofit advocacy corporations\xe2\x80\x94either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election.  Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under \xc2\xa7441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate\xe2\x80\x99s defense of\nfree speech.  These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 330\xe2\x80\x93333 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  A PAC is a separate association from the corporation.  So the PAC exemption from \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban, \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.  Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak\xe2\x80\x94and it does not\xe2\x80\x94the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with \xc2\xa7441b.  PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.  For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within 10 days.  See <em>id.</em>, at 330\xe2\x80\x93332 (quoting <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 253\xe2\x80\x93254).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that is just the beginning.  PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is about to occur:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98These reports must contain information regarding the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of receipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identification of each political committee and candidate\xe2\x80\x99s authorized or affiliated committee making contributions, and any persons making loans, providing rebates, refunds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to operating expenditures in an aggregate amount over $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggregating over $200 have been made; persons to whom loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total sum of all contributions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obligations, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 331\xe2\x80\x93332 (quoting <em>MCFL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253\xe2\x80\x93254).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to\nspeak.  This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs.\nSee Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et\xc2\xa0al. as\n<em>Amici Curiae</em> 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity 1990\xe2\x80\x932006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/\n20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income: 2006, Corporation Income Tax Returns<em> </em>2 (2009) (hereinafter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns).  PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak.  Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 441b\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech.  As a \xe2\x80\x9crestriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d that statute \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 19 (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Were the Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 251 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (Government could repress speech by \xe2\x80\x9cattacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ceffective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others\xe2\x80\x9d).  If \xc2\xa7441b applied to individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on speech.  Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.  See <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential\xe2\x80\x9d).  The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it.  The First Amendment \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98has its fullest and most urgent application\xe2\x80\x99 to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eu</em> v. <em>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/214/index.html">489 U. S. 214</a>, 223 (1989) (quoting <em>Monitor Patriot Co.</em> v. <em>Roy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/265/index.html">401 U. S. 265</a>, 272 (1971)); see <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 14 (\xe2\x80\x9cDiscussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence.  Laws that burden political speech are \xe2\x80\x9csubject to strict scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \xe2\x80\x9cfurthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL, </em>551 U. S., at 464 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a categorical matter, see <em>Simon &amp; Schuster</em>, 502 U. S., at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), the quoted language from <em>WRTL</em> provides a sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.  We shall employ it here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a>, 813 (2000) (striking down content-based restriction).  Prohibited, too, are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.  See <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 784 (1978).  As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:  Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.  By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice.  The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.  The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but these rulings were based on an interest in allowing governmental entities to perform their functions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Bethel School Dist. No. 403</em> v. <em>Fraser</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/675/index.html">478 U. S. 675</a>, 683 (1986) (protecting the \xe2\x80\x9cfunction of public school education\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Jones</em> v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 Labor Union, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/119/index.html">433 U. S. 119</a>, 129 (1977) (furthering \xe2\x80\x9cthe legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Levy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/733/index.html">417 U. S. 733</a>, 759 (1974) (ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cthe capacity of the Government to discharge its [military] responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Letter Carriers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/index.html">413 U. S. 548</a>, 557 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service\xe2\x80\x9d).  The corporate independent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are inapposite.  These precedents stand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech.  By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes.  At least before <em>Austin</em>, the Court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.

See B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 23 (2001).  Yet not until 1947 did Congress first prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and labor unions in \xc2\xa7304 of the Labor Management Relations Act 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)).  In passing this Act Congress overrode the veto of President Truman, who warned that the expenditure ban was a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous intrusion on free speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Message from the President of the United States, H.\xc2\xa0R.

No. 334,  89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and union expenditures are constitutional.  See <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 502 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The question was in the background of <em>United States</em> v. <em>CIO</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/106/index.html">335 U.

The Court emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe independent expenditure ceiling \xe2\x80\xa6 fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <em>quid pro quo</em> for improper commitments from the candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 47.  <em>Buckley</em> invalidated \xc2\xa7608(e)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice dissenting.  See <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/index.html">470 U.

Had \xc2\xa7610 been challenged in the wake of <em>Buckley</em>, however, it could not have been squared with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent.  See <em>WRTL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 487 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Buckley </em>might well have been the last word on limitations on independent expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 683 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The expenditure ban invalidated in <em>Buckley</em>, \xc2\xa7608(e), applied to corporations and unions, 424 U.

The <em>Buckley</em> Court did not invoke the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s overbreadth doctrine, see <em>Broadrick</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/601/index.html">413 U. S. 601</a>, 615 (1973), to suggest that \xc2\xa7608(e)\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban would have been constitutional if it had applied only to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., at 50.  <em>Buckley</em> cited with approval the <em>Automobile Workers</em> dissent, which argued that \xc2\xa7610 was unconstitutional.  424 U. S., at 43 (citing 352 U.

It rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from speaking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bellotti</em> did not address the constitutionality of the State\xe2\x80\x99s ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates.  In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus the law stood until Austin</em>.  <em>Austin</em> \xe2\x80\x9cuph[eld] a direct restriction on the independent expenditure of funds for political speech for the first time in [this Court\xe2\x80\x99s] history.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 695 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  There, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general treasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a specific candidate.  Michigan law, however, prohibited corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state office.  A violation of the law was punishable as a felony.  The Court sustained the speech prohibition.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To bypass <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti</em>, the <em>Austin</em> Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion interest.  <em>Austin</em> found a compelling governmental interest in preventing \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 660; see <em>id.</em>, at 659 (citing <em>MCFL, </em>479 U. S., at 257; <em>NCPAC, </em>470 U. S., at 500\xe2\x80\x93501).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-<em>Austin</em> line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity and a post-<em>Austin</em> line that permits them.  No case before <em>Austin </em>had held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures for political speech based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.  Before <em>Austin</em> Congress had enacted legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the same proposition before this Court.  See <em>MCFL, supra</em>, at 257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to \xe2\x80\x9ccurb the political influence of \xe2\x80\x98those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 585)); <em>California Medical Assn.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/182/index.html">453 U. S. 182</a>, 201 (1981) (Congress believed that \xe2\x80\x9cdiffering structures and purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of corporations and unions \xe2\x80\x9cmay require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process\xe2\x80\x9d).  In neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in \xc2\xa7441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on which <em>Austin</em> and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but abandons reliance upon it.  It argues instead that two other compelling interests support <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see <em>id.</em>, at 674\xe2\x80\x93675 (Brennan, J., concurring).  We consider the three points in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it.  See Tr. of  Oral Arg. 45\xe2\x80\x9348 (Sept. 9, 2009).  And with good reason, for the rationale cannot support \xc2\xa7441b.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.  If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form.  The Government contends that <em>Austin </em>permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communication stemming from a corporation.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93E, <em>supra;</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also <em>id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9331 (Mar. 24, 2009).  If <em>Austin</em> were correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books.  The Government responds \xe2\x80\x9cthat the FEC has never applied this statute to a book,\xe2\x80\x9d and if it did, \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).  This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Political speech is \xe2\x80\x9cindispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see <em>ibid.</em> (the worth of speech \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); <em>CIO</em>, 335 U. S., at 154\xe2\x80\x93155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  This protection for speech is inconsistent with <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale.  <em>Austin</em> sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corporations from obtaining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by using \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98resources amassed in the economic marketplace.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 659 (quoting <em>MCFL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 257).  But <em>Buckley</em> rejected the premise that the Government has an interest \xe2\x80\x9cin equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 48; see <em>Bellotti, supra,</em> at 791, n. 30.  <em>Buckley</em> was specific in stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe skyrocketing cost of political campaigns\xe2\x80\x9d could not sustain the governmental prohibition.  424 U. S., at 26.  The First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections do not depend on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invalidated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  See <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9cLeveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election.  The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters\xe2\x80\x99 choices\xe2\x80\x9d).  The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s identity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a further argument, the <em>Austin</em> majority undertook to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tate law grants corporations special advantages\xe2\x80\x94such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 658\xe2\x80\x93659.  This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is rudimentary that the State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 680 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that corporate funds may \xe2\x80\x9chave little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 660 (majority opinion).  All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.  The First Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s ideas.  See <em>id.</em>, at 707 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cMany persons can trace their funds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then in the form of dividends, interest, or salary\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media corporations.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe chilling endpoint of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press\xe2\x80\x9d).  Cf. <em>Tornillo</em>, 418 U. S., at 250 (alleging the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cvast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires\xe2\x80\x9d).  Media corporations are now exempt from \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s ban on corporate expenditures.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i).  Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the largest media corporations have \xe2\x80\x9cimmense aggregations of wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d and the views expressed by media corporations often \xe2\x80\x9chave little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support\xe2\x80\x9d for those views.  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  Thus, under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities.  There is no precedent for permitting this under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law now under consideration.  There is no precedent supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media corporations and those which are not.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 691 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U. S.<em>,</em> at 782); see <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.</em> v. <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/749/index.html">472 U. S. 749</a>, 784 (1985) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 773 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law\xe2\x80\x99s exception for media corporations is, on its own terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidistortion rationale.  And the exemption results in a further, separate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, even though both have the need or the motive to communicate their views.  The exemption applies to media corporations owned or controlled by corporations that have diverse and substantial investments and participate in endeavors other than news.  So even assuming the most doubtful proposition that a news organization has a right to speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a conglomerate that owns both a media business and an unrelated business to influence or control the media in order to advance its overall business interest.  At the same time, some other corporation, with an identical business interest but no media outlet in its ownership structure, would be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the same issue.  This differential treatment cannot be squared with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is simply no support for the view that the First Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the suppression of political speech by media corporations.  The Framers may not have anticipated modern business and media corporations.  See <em>McIntyre</em> v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/334/index.html">514 U. S. 334</a>, 360\xe2\x80\x93361 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Yet television networks and major newspapers owned by media corporations have become the most important means of mass communication in modern times.  The First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society\xe2\x80\x99s most salient media.  It was understood as a response to the repression of speech and the press that had existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press that were imposed in the colonies.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 252\xe2\x80\x93253 (opinion of Scalia, J.); <em>Grosjean</em>, 297 U. S., at 245\xe2\x80\x93248; <em>Near</em>, 283 U. S., at 713\xe2\x80\x93714.  The great debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists over our founding document were published and expressed in the most important means of mass communication of that era\xe2\x80\x94newspapers owned by individuals.  See <em>McIntyre</em>, 514 U. S., at 341\xe2\x80\x93343; <em>id.</em>, at 367 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  At the founding, speech was open, comprehensive, and vital to society\xe2\x80\x99s definition of itself; there were no limits on the sources of speech and knowledge.  See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 5 (1967) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny number of people could join in such proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from all sides\xe2\x80\x9d); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic 1776\xe2\x80\x931787, p. 6 (1969) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not surprising that the intellectual sources of [the Americans\xe2\x80\x99] Revolutionary thought were profuse and various\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Framers may have been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of communication, but that does not mean that those speakers and media are entitled to less First Amendment protection than those types of speakers and media that provided the means of communicating political ideas when the Bill of Rights was adopted.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Austin </em>interferes with the \xe2\x80\x9copen marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  <em>New York State Bd. of Elections</em> v. <em>Lopez Torres</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/196/index.html">552 U.

It permits the Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens.  See Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns).  Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth.  See Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million businesses that belong to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce have fewer than 100 employees); M. Keightley, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Business Organizational Choices: Taxation and Responses to Legislative Changes 10 (2009) (more than 75% of corporations whose income is taxed under federal law, see 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year).  This fact belies the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the statute is justified on the ground that it prevents the \xe2\x80\x9cdistorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach.

By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit, the Government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests.  Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the remedy of \xe2\x80\x9cdestroying the liberty\xe2\x80\x9d of some factions is \xe2\x80\x9cworse than the disease.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 10, p. 130 (B.

Brief for State of Montana et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 19.  When that phenomenon is coupled with \xc2\xa7441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit corporations cannot raise a voice to object when other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are cooperating with the Government.  That cooperation may sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a Government official who uses his or her authority, influence, and power to threaten corporations to support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  Those kinds of interactions are often unknown and unseen.  The speech that \xc2\xa7441b forbids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and purpose.  References to massive corporate treasuries should not mask the real operation of this law.  Rhetoric ought not obscure reality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so.  And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 503\xe2\x80\x93504 (opinion of Scalia,\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142 million to [26 U.

Yet certain disfavored associations of citizens\xe2\x80\x94those that have taken on the corporate form\xe2\x80\x94are penalized for engaging in the same political speech.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought.  This is unlawful.  The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.    </p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government.  For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.  In <em>Buckley</em>, the Court found this interest \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that reasoning to expenditure limits.  424 U. S., at 25.  When <em>Buckley</em> examined an expenditure ban, it found \xe2\x80\x9cthat the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to large direct contributions, <em>Buckley</em> reasoned that they could be given \xe2\x80\x9cto secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 26, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 27.  The practices <em>Buckley</em> noted would be covered by bribery laws, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201, if a <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangement were proved.  See <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 27, and n. 28 (citing <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 821, 839\xe2\x80\x93840, and nn. 36\xe2\x80\x9338 (CADC 1975) (en banc) <em>(per curiam)</em>).  The Court, in consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements.  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 260; <em>NCPAC</em>, 470 U. S., at 500; <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/197/index.html">459 U. S. 197</a>, 210 (1982) <em>(NRWC)</em>.  The <em>Buckley</em> Court, nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of corruption.  That case did not extend this rationale to independent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <em>quid pro quo</em> for improper commitments from the candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 47; see <em>ibid. </em>(independent expenditures have a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially diminished potential for abuse\xe2\x80\x9d).  Limits on independent expenditures, such as \xc2\xa7441b, have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.  The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.  Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expenditures by for-profit corporations.  The Government does not claim that these expenditures have corrupted the political process in those States.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n.\xc2\xa03; Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa05.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A single footnote in <em>Bellotti </em>purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be shown to cause corruption.  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.  For the reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  Dicta in <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote suggested that \xe2\x80\x9ca corporation\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Citing the portion of <em>Buckley</em> that invalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424 U. S., at 46, and a law review student comment, <em>Bellotti </em>surmised that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.  <em>Buckley</em>, however, struck down a ban on independent expenditures to support candidates that covered corporations, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 42.  <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s dictum is thus supported only by a law review student comment, which misinterpreted <em>Buckley</em>.  See Comment, The Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and Minority Rights and Remedies, 126 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 386, 408 (1977) (suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations and labor unions should be held to different and more stringent standards than an individual or other associations under a regulatory scheme for campaign financing\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seizing on this aside in <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote, the Court in <em>NRWC</em> did say there is a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d governmental interest in \xe2\x80\x9censur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth amassed\xe2\x80\x9d by corporations would not \xe2\x80\x9cbe used to incur political debts from legislators who are aided by the contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  459 U. S., at 207\xe2\x80\x93208 (citing <em>Automobile Workers, </em>352 U. S., at 579); see 459 U. S., at 210, and n.\xc2\xa07; <em>NCPAC, supra,</em> at 500\xe2\x80\x93501 (<em>NRWC</em> suggested a governmental interest in restricting \xe2\x80\x9cthe influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>NRWC</em>, however,<em> </em>has little relevance here.  <em>NRWC</em> decided no more than that a restriction on a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s ability to solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct contributions to candidates, did not violate the First Amendment.  459 U. S., at 206.  <em>NRWC</em> thus involved contribution limits, see <em>NCPAC</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495\xe2\x80\x93496, which, unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption, see <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 136\xe2\x80\x93138, and n. 40; <em>MCFL, supra,</em> at 259\xe2\x80\x93260.  Citizens United has not made direct contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When <em>Buckley</em> identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 296\xe2\x80\x93298 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (citing <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 26\xe2\x80\x9328, 30, 46\xe2\x80\x9348); <em>NCPAC, </em>470 U. S.<em>,</em> at 497 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe hallmark of corruption is the financial <em>quid pro quo:</em> dollars for political favors\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 498.  The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFavoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics.  It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies.  It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors.  Democracy is premised on responsiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 297 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p align="left">\nReliance on a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 296.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.  By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.  See <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 46.  The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.  This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to take part in democratic governance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 144 (quoting <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 390 (2000)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Caperton</em> v. <em>A. T. Massey Coal Co.</em>, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), is not to the contrary.  <em>Caperton</em> held that a judge was required to recuse himself \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 14).  The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge.  See <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Larkin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/35/index.html">421 U. S. 35</a>, 46 (1975).  <em>Caperton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s political speech could be banned.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>McConnell</em> record was \xe2\x80\x9cover 100,000 pages\xe2\x80\x9d long, <em>McConnell I</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 209, yet it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not have any direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  This confirms <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.  In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate.  See 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 555\xe2\x80\x93557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.  The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called \xe2\x80\x9csoft money,\xe2\x80\x9d were made to gain access to elected officials.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 125, 130\xe2\x80\x93131, 146\xe2\x80\x93152; see <em>McConnell I</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 471\xe2\x80\x93481, 491\xe2\x80\x93506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 842\xe2\x80\x93843, 858\xe2\x80\x93859 (opinion of Leon, J.).  This case, however, is about independent expenditures, not soft money.  When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy.  If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern.  We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences.  The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule.  An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.  Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech.  This asserted interest, like <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the political speech even of media corporations.  See <em>supra, </em>at 35\xe2\x80\x9337.  Assume, for example, that a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper disagrees with the political views the newspaper expresses.  See <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 687 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, that potential disagreement could give the Government the authority to restrict the media corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political speech.  The First Amendment does not allow that power.  There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders \xe2\x80\x9cthrough the procedures of corporate democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S., at 794; see <em>id.</em>, at 794, n. 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder-protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive.  As to the first, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election.  A dissenting shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any time.  As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with only single shareholders.  As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and explore other regulatory mechanisms.  The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s political process.  Cf. 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to \xe2\x80\x9cforeign national[s]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders.  Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, <em>arguendo,</em> that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.  See <em>Broadrick</em>, 413 U. S., at 615.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts us on a course that is sure error.  \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of <em>stare decisis</em> include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Montejo</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, 556 U.

The Government defends <em>Austin</em>, relying almost entirely on \xe2\x80\x9cthe quid pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the shareholder interest,\xe2\x80\x9d and not <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s expressed antidistortion rationale.

When neither party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of adhering to that precedent through <em>stare decisis</em> is diminished.  <em>Austin</em> abandoned First Amendment principles, furthermore, by relying on language in some of our precedents that traces back to the <em>Automobile Workers</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as <em>Amici Curiae;</em> Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts 33\xe2\x80\x9335, 153\xe2\x80\x93157 (1988).  See <em>Austin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 659 (quoting <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U.

Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McConnell,</em> 540 U. S., at 176\xe2\x80\x93177 (\xe2\x80\x9cGiven BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26 U.

Our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights.  Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle.  Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views.  On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of\nall sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rapid changes in technology\xe2\x80\x94and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression\xe2\x80\x94counsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>supra</em>.  Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message.  See <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 261 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues.  Yet, \xc2\xa7441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(a); <em>MCFL, supra,</em> at 249.  The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No serious reliance interests are at stake.  As the Court stated in <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U.

Here, though, parties have been prevented from acting\xe2\x80\x94corporations have been banned from making independent expenditures.  Legislatures may have enacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those bans were constitutional.  This is not a compelling interest for <em>stare decisis</em>.

We return to the principle established in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti</em> that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity.

Section 441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures are therefore invalid and cannot be applied to <em>Hillary</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule the part of <em>McConnell</em> that upheld BCRA \xc2\xa7203\xe2\x80\x99s extension of \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures.  See 540 U. S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93209.  The <em>McConnell</em> Court relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld in <em>Austin</em>, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have found this interest unconvincing and insufficient.  This part of <em>McConnell</em> is now overruled.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United next challenges BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclaimer and disclosure provisions as applied to <em>Hillary</em> and the three advertisements for the movie.  Under BCRA \xc2\xa7311, televised electioneering communications funded by anyone other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98_______ is responsible for the content of this advertising.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  2 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7441d(d)(2).  The required statement must be made in a \xe2\x80\x9cclearly spoken manner,\xe2\x80\x9d and displayed on the screen in a \xe2\x80\x9cclearly readable manner\xe2\x80\x9d for at least four seconds.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It must state that the communication \xe2\x80\x9cis not authorized by any candidate or candidate\xe2\x80\x99s committee\xe2\x80\x9d; it must also display the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or group that funded the advertisement.  \xc2\xa7441d(a)(3).  Under BCRA \xc2\xa7201, any person who spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year must file a disclosure statement with the FEC.  2 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7434(f)(1).  That statement must identify the person making the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the communication was directed, and the names of certain contributors.  \xc2\xa7434(f)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \xe2\x80\x9cimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S.,<em> </em>at 64, and \xe2\x80\x9cdo not prevent anyone from speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell, supra</em>, at 201 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  The Court has subjected these requirements to \xe2\x80\x9cexacting scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d which requires a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial relation\xe2\x80\x9d between the disclosure requirement and a \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important\xe2\x80\x9d governmental interest.  <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 64, 66 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 231\xe2\x80\x93232.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Buckley</em>, the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] the electorate with information\xe2\x80\x9d about the sources of election-related spending.  424 U. S., at 66.  The <em>McConnell</em> Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 197 (quoting <em>McConnell I</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 237).  The Court therefore upheld BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98make informed choices in the political marketplace.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 197 (quoting <em>McConnell I, supra,</em>  at 237); see 540 U. S.,  at 231.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although both provisions were facially upheld, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable probability\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that disclosure of its contributors\xe2\x80\x99 names \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 198 (quoting <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 74).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 10-second ads to promote <em>Hillary</em>.  Under FEC regulations, a communication that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roposes a commercial transaction\xe2\x80\x9d was not subject to 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on corporate or union funding of electioneering communications.  11 CFR \xc2\xa7114.15(b)(3)(ii).  The regulations, however, do not exempt those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311.  See 72 Fed. Reg. 72901 (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United argues that the disclaimer requirements in \xc2\xa7311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads.  It contends that the governmental interest in providing information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including the ones at issue here.  We disagree.  The ads fall within BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy.  See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2\xe2\x80\x934.  The disclaimers required by \xc2\xa7311 \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] the electorate with information,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell, supra</em>, at 196, and \xe2\x80\x9cinsure that the voters are fully informed\xe2\x80\x9d about the person or group who is speaking, <em>Buckley, supra,</em> at 76; see also <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 32 (\xe2\x80\x9cIdentification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the very least, the disclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United argues that \xc2\xa7311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising.  It asserts that \xc2\xa7311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of the group\xe2\x80\x99s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer.  We rejected these arguments in <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 230\xe2\x80\x93231.  And we now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclosure provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, the disclosure requirements in \xc2\xa7201 must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The principal opinion in <em>WRTL</em> limited 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on independent expenditures to express advocacy and its functional equivalent.  551 U. S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93476 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.).  Citizens United seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements.  We reject this contention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 262.  In <em>Buckley</em>, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expenditures even though it invalidated a provision that imposed a ceiling on those expenditures.  424 U. S., at 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  In <em>McConnell</em>, three Justices who would have found \xc2\xa7441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure and disclaimer requirements.  540 U. S., at 321 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia, J.).  And the Court has upheld registration and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Harriss</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/612/index.html">347 U. S. 612</a>, 625 (1954) (Congress \xe2\x80\x9chas merely provided for a modicum of information from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose\xe2\x80\x9d).  For these reasons, we reject Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United also disputes that an informational interest justifies the application of \xc2\xa7201 to its ads, which only attempt to persuade viewers to see the film.  Even if it disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens United says, the information would not help viewers make informed choices in the political marketplace.  This is similar to the argument rejected above with respect to disclaimers.  Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.  Because the informational interest alone is sufficient to justify application of \xc2\xa7201 to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s other asserted interests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements can chill donations to an organization by exposing donors to retaliation.  Some <em>amici</em> point to recent events in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.  See Brief for Institute for Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9316; Brief for Alliance Defense Fund as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9322.  In <em>McConnell</em>, the Court recognized that \xc2\xa7201 would be unconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a reasonable probability that the group\xe2\x80\x99s members would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were disclosed.  540 U. S., at 198.  The examples cited by <em>amici</em> are cause for concern.  Citizens United, however, has offered no evidence that its members may face similar threats or reprisals.  To the contrary, Citizens United has been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of corporate democracy, see <em>Bellotti</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 794, and n. 34, can be more effective today because modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative.  A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today.  It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings in passing BCRA were premised on a system without adequate disclosure.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 128 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 196\xe2\x80\x93197 (quoting <em>McConnell I</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 237).  With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.  Shareholders can determine whether their corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political speech advances the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the pocket\xe2\x80\x99 of so-called moneyed interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see <em>MCFL</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 261.  The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way.  This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reasons we uphold the application of BCRA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their application to <em>Hillary</em>.  We find no constitutional impediment to the application of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s disclaimer and disclosure requirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand.  And there has been no showing that, as applied in this case, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or expression.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When word concerning the plot of the movie <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington </em>reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution.  See Smoodin, \xe2\x80\x9cCompulsory\xe2\x80\x9d Viewing for Every Citizen: <em>Mr. Smith </em>and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra\xe2\x80\x99s Capitol Offense, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5.  Under <em>Austin</em>, though, officials could have done more than discourage its distribution\xe2\x80\x94they could have banned the film.  After all, it, like <em>Hillary, </em>was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress.  <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em> may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways.  Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\xe2\x80\x9d in order to engage in political speech.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7431(9)(A)(i).  Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election.  Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime.  Yet this is the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and design.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some members of the public might consider <em>Hillary </em>to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates.  Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech.  Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas.  The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 341 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U.

It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern.  Its theory, if accepted, would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long as the newspapers were owned by corporations\xe2\x80\x94as the major ones are.  First Amendment rights could be confined to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opinion in full.

S. 142</a>, 147\xe2\x80\x93148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring).  Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us.

This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U.

But I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how these principles apply in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s step-by-step analysis accords with our standard practice of avoiding broad constitutional questions except when necessary to decide the case before us.  The majority begins by addressing\xe2\x80\x94and quite properly rejecting\xe2\x80\x94Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s statutory claim that 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b does not actually cover its production and distribution of <em>Hillary: The Movie</em> (hereinafter <em>Hillary</em>).  If there were a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s favor (and thereby avoiding constitutional adjudication), it would be proper to do so.  Indeed, that is precisely the approach the Court took just last Term in <em>Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), when eight Members of the Court agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds instead of reaching the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s broader argument that the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s statutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group\xe2\x80\x99s various constitutional arguments, beginning with its narrowest claim (that <em>Hillary</em> is not the functional equivalent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest claim (that <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html">494 U. S. 652</a> (1990) should be overruled).  This is the same order of operations followed by the controlling opinion in <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html">551 U. S. 449</a> (2007) (<em>WRTL</em>).  There the appellant was able to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument because its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional equivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to go on to address the broader claim that <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003), should be overruled.  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S.,<em> </em>at 482; <em>id</em>., at 482\xe2\x80\x93483 (Alito, J., concurring).  This case is different\xe2\x80\x94not, as the dissent suggests, because the approach taken in <em>WRTL</em> has been deemed a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 11, but because, in the absence of any valid narrower ground of decision, there is no way to avoid Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s broader constitutional argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claims that I find quite perplexing.  It presumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s narrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack merit\xe2\x80\x94otherwise its conclusion that the group should lose this case would make no sense.  Despite agreeing that these narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent argues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question of whether <em>Austin</em> remains good law.  It even suggests that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to adopt one of these concededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority is not \xe2\x80\x9cserious about judicial restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach is based on a false premise: that our practice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily broad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obligation faithfully to interpret the law.  It should go without saying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right.  Thus while it is true that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it <em>is</em> necessary to decide more.  There is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication.  When constitutional questions are \xe2\x80\x9cindispensably necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to resolving the case at hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court must meet and decide them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Randolph</em>, 20 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s broader argument that <em>Austin</em> should be overruled, the debate over whether to consider this claim on an as-applied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the point.  Citizens United has standing\xe2\x80\x94it is being injured by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of the Act.  Citizens United has a constitutional claim\xe2\x80\x94the Act violates the First Amendment, because it prohibits political speech.  The Government has a defense\xe2\x80\x94the Act may be enforced, consistent with the First Amendment, against corporations.  Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the question before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no difference of any substance whether this case is resolved by invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to Citizens United.  Even if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens United\xe2\x80\x94because corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights\xe2\x80\x94would mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win.  Likewise, a conclusion that the Act may be applied to Citizens United\xe2\x80\x94because it is constitutional to prohibit corporate political speech\xe2\x80\x94would similarly govern future cases.  Regardless whether we label Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claim a \xe2\x80\x9cfacial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied\xe2\x80\x9d challenge, the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision are the same.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in the same direction: Congress may not prohibit political speech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union.

The dissent erroneously declares that the Court \xe2\x80\x9creaffirmed\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding in subsequent cases\xe2\x80\x94namely, <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/146/index.html">539 U.

Not a single party in any of those cases asked us to overrule <em>Austin</em>, and as the dissent points out, <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, the Court generally does not consider constitutional arguments that have not properly been raised.  <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s validity was therefore not directly at issue in the cases the dissent cites.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to overturn <em>Austin</em> in those cases cannot be understood as a <em>reaffirmation</em> of that decision.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fidelity to precedent\xe2\x80\x94the policy of <em>stare decisis</em>\xe2\x80\x94is vital to the proper exercise of the judicial function.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Stare decisis</em> is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/808/index.html">501 U.

When considering whether to reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of having constitutional questions <em>decided</em> against the importance of having them <em>decided right</em>.  As Justice Jackson explained, this requires a \xe2\x80\x9csober appraisal of the disadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jackson, Decisional Law and <em>Stare Decisis</em>, 30 A.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0A. J. 334 (1944).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that <em>stare decisis</em> is not an end in itself.  It is instead \xe2\x80\x9cthe means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vasquez</em> v. <em>Hillery</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/254/index.html">474 U. S. 254</a>, 265 (1986).  Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal\xe2\x80\x94the rule of law.  It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration itself departed from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence, returning to the \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98intrinsically sounder\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine established in prior cases\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cbetter serv[e] the values of <em>stare decisis</em> than would following [the] more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Pe\xc5\x84a</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/200/index.html">515 U. S. 200</a>, 231 (1995); see also <em>Helvering</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 119; <em>Randall</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 274 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Abrogating the errant precedent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better preserve the law\xe2\x80\x99s coherence and curtail the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive effects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes the stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its <em>stare decisis</em> effect is also diminished.  This can happen in a number of circumstances, such as when the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s validity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for decision in future cases, when its rationale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in related areas of law, and when the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s underlying reasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot keep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and different justifications to shore up the original mistake.  See, <em>e.g., Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan,</em> 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10); <em>Montejo</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13) (<em>stare decisis</em> does not control when adherence to the prior decision requires \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentally revising its theoretical basis\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations weigh against retaining our decision in <em>Austin</em>.  First, as the majority explains, that decision was an \xe2\x80\x9caberration\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as it departed from the robust protections we had granted political speech in our earlier cases.  <em>Ante</em>, at 39; see also <em>Buckley</em>, <em>supra</em>; <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978).  <em>Austin</em> undermined<em> </em>the careful line that <em>Buckley</em> drew to distinguish limits on contributions to candidates from limits on independent expenditures on speech.  <em>Buckley</em> rejected the asserted government interest in regulating independent expenditures, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9349; see also <em>Bellotti</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 790\xe2\x80\x93791; <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing</em> v. <em>Berkeley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/290/index.html">454 U. S. 290</a>, 295 (1981).  <em>Austin</em>, however, allowed the Government to prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\xe2\x80\x9d in the marketplace of ideas.  494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was\xe2\x80\x94and remains\xe2\x80\x94inconsistent with <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explicit repudiation of any government interest in \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Austin</em> was also inconsistent with <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s clear rejection of the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cspeech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection simply because its source is a corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U. S., at 784.  The dissent correctly points out that <em>Bellotti</em> involved a referendum rather than a candidate election, and that <em>Bellotti</em> itself noted this factual distinction, <em>id</em>., at 788, n. 26; <em>post</em>, at 52.  But this distinction does not explain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on speech in candidate elections when individuals may not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the validity of <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale\xe2\x80\x94itself adopted over two \xe2\x80\x9cspirited dissents,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Payne</em>, 501 U. S.<em>,</em> at 829\xe2\x80\x94has proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Members of this Court ever since.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>WRTL,</em> 551 U. S., at 483 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <em>McConnell,</em> 540 U. S., at 247, 264, 286 (opinions of Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy, JJ.); <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 163, 164 (opinions of Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.).  The simple fact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of course, insufficient to justify overruling it.  But it does undermine the precedent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to contribute to the stable and orderly development of the law.  In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Court\xe2\x80\x94which in this case is squarely asked to reconsider <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s validity for the first time\xe2\x80\x94to address the matter with a greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the <em>Austin</em> decision is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions even outside the particular context of corporate express advocacy.  The First Amendment theory underlying <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding is extraordinarily broad.  <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic would authorize government prohibition of political speech by a category of speakers in the name of equality\xe2\x80\x94a point that most scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that the dissent denies.  Compare, <em>e.g.</em>, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L.\xc2\xa0J. 655, 669 (2009) (<em>Austin</em> \xe2\x80\x9chas been understood by most commentators to be an opinion driven by equality considerations, albeit disguised in the language of \xe2\x80\x98political corruption\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d) with <em>post</em>, at 74 (<em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rationale \xe2\x80\x9cis manifestly not just an \xe2\x80\x98equalizing\xe2\x80\x99 ideal in disguise\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the Court have relied on <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s expansive logic to justify greater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside the original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of candidates running for office.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (relying on <em>Austin</em> and other cases to justify restrictions on campaign spending by individual candidates, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason that their logic\xe2\x80\x94specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process\xe2\x80\x94is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 203\xe2\x80\x93209 (extending <em>Austin</em> beyond its original context to cover not only the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d of express advocacy by corporations, but also electioneering speech conducted by labor unions).  The dissent in this case succumbs to the same temptation, suggesting that <em>Austin</em> justifies prohibiting corporate speech because such speech might unduly influence \xe2\x80\x9cthe market for legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 82.  The dissent reads <em>Austin</em> to permit restrictions on corporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that the corporate form may help individuals coordinate and present their views more effectively.  <em>Post,</em> at 82.  A speaker\xe2\x80\x99s ability to persuade, however, provides no basis for government regulation of free and open public debate on what the laws should be.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If taken seriously, <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s logic would apply most directly to newspapers and other media corporations.  They have a more profound impact on public discourse than most other speakers.  These corporate entities are, for the time being, not subject to \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise generally applicable prohibitions on corporate political speech.  But this is simply a matter of legislative grace.  The fact that the law currently grants a favored position to media corporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in accepting a theory that would allow government restrictions on their political speech.  See generally <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 283\xe2\x80\x93286 (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These readings of <em>Austin</em> do no more than carry that decision\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning to its logical endpoint.  In doing so, they highlight the threat <em>Austin</em> poses to First Amendment rights generally, even outside its specific factual context of corporate express advocacy.  Because <em>Austin</em> is so difficult to confine to its facts\xe2\x80\x94and because its logic threatens to undermine our First Amendment jurisprudence and the nature of public discourse more broadly\xe2\x80\x94the costs of giving it <em>stare decisis</em> effect are unusually high.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally and most importantly, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own effort to defend <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x94or, more accurately, to defend something that is not quite <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x94underscores its weakness as a precedent of the Court.  The Government concedes that <em>Austin</em> \xe2\x80\x9cis not the most lucid opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d yet asks us to reaffirm its holding.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9, 2009).  But while invoking <em>stare decisis</em> to support this position, the Government never once even <em>mentions</em> the compelling interest that <em>Austin</em> relied upon in the first place: the need to diminish \xe2\x80\x9cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s political ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U. S., at 660.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of endorsing <em>Austin</em> on its own terms, the Government urges us to reaffirm <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s specific holding on the basis of two new and potentially expansive interests\xe2\x80\x94the need to prevent actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption, and the need to protect corporate shareholders.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 8\xe2\x80\x9310, 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Those interests may or may not support the <em>result</em> in <em>Austin</em>, but they were plainly not part of the <em>reasoning</em> on which <em>Austin</em> relied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that <em>Austin</em> did not embrace either of the new rationales it now urges upon us.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court did not decide in <em>Austin</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 whether the compelling interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption provides a constitutionally sufficient justification for prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds for independent electioneering\xe2\x80\x9d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Austin</em> did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest compelling interest\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 61 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The Court:] I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest.  This is a new argument.  [The Government:] I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s fair\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 64 (\xe2\x80\x9c[The Court:] In other words, you are asking us to uphold <em>Austin</em> on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted in [the context of limits on political expenditures].  [The Government:] [I]n this particular context, fair enough\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be clear: The Court in <em>Austin</em> nowhere relied upon the only arguments the Government now raises to support that decision.  In fact, the only opinion in <em>Austin </em>endorsing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument based on the threat of <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption was Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence.  494 U. S., at 678.  The Court itself did not do so, despite the fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument.  Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s only discussion of shareholder protection in <em>Austin</em> appeared in a section of the opinion that sought merely to distinguish <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s facts from those of <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html">479 U. S. 238</a> (1986).  <em>Austin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 663.  Nowhere did <em>Austin</em> suggest that the goal of protecting shareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing restrictions on First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case for reaffirming <em>Austin</em> depends on radically reconceptualizing its reasoning, that argument is at odds with itself.  <em>Stare decisis</em> is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation.  It counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones.  There is therefore no basis for the Court to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has never accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to support a conclusion reached on different grounds that have since been abandoned or discredited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that justify <em>stare decisis</em> in the first place.  It would effectively license the Court to invent and adopt new principles of constitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing its past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those principles have merit on their own.  This approach would allow the Court\xe2\x80\x99s past missteps to spawn future mistakes, undercutting the very rule-of-law values that <em>stare decisis</em> is designed to protect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of this is to say that the Government is barred from making new arguments to support the outcome in <em>Austin</em>.  On the contrary, it is free to do so.  And of course the Court is free to accept them.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s new arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are not entitled to receive the special deference we accord to precedent.  They are, as grounds to support <em>Austin</em>, literally <em>un</em>precedented.  Moreover, to the extent the Government relies on new arguments\xe2\x80\x94and declines to defend <em>Austin</em> on its own terms\xe2\x80\x94we may reasonably infer that it lacks confidence in that decision\xe2\x80\x99s original justification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because continued adherence to <em>Austin</em> threatens to subvert the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled and intelligible\xe2\x80\x9d development of our First Amendment jurisprudence, <em>Vasquez</em>, 474 U.

This section of the dissent purports to show that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is not supported by the original understanding of the First Amendment.  The dissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment.  It never shows why \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form.  To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations could pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters; but the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in the pursuit of those objectives could be censored.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of taking this straightforward approach to determining the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, the dissent embarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 views about the \xe2\x80\x9crole of corporations in society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 35.  The Framers didn\xe2\x80\x99t like corporations, the dissent concludes, and therefore it follows (as night the day) that corporations had no rights of free speech.  Of course the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 personal affection or disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected in the understood meaning of the text they enacted\xe2\x80\x94not, as the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for that text.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s distortion of proper analysis is even worse than that.  Though faced with a constitutional text that makes no distinction between types of speakers, the dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated statement from the founding era to the effect that corporations are <em>not </em>covered, but places the burden on petitioners to bring forward statements showing that they <em>are</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 34\xe2\x80\x9335).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent has dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the 18th century corporations were despised.  If so, how came there to be so many of them?  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s statement that there were few business corporations during the eighteenth century\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly a few hundred during all of the 18th century\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is misleading.  <em>Post, </em>at 35, n.\xe2\x80\x8253.  There were approximately 335 charters issued to business corporations in the United States by the end of the 18th century.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See 2 J.\xe2\x80\x82Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of American Corporations 24 (1917) (reprint 2006) (hereinafter Davis).  This was a \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable extension of corporate enterprise in the field of business,\xe2\x80\x9d Davis 8, and represented \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented growth,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 309.  Moreover, what seems like a small number by today\xe2\x80\x99s standards surely does not indicate the relative importance of corporations when the Nation was considerably smaller.  As I have previously noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U.

Cooke, Corporation Trust and Company 92 (1951) (hereinafter Cooke)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion.  Most of the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Founders\xe2\x80\x94excluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society.  Moreover, if the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 specific intent with respect to corporations is what matters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 views about other legal entities that have more in common with modern business corporations than the founding-era corporations?  At the time of the founding, religious, educational, and literary corporations were incorporated under general incorporation statutes, much as business corporations are today.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See Davis 16\xe2\x80\x9317; R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784\xe2\x80\x931855, p.\xc2\xa05 (1982); Cooke 94.  There were also small unincorporated business associations, which some have argued were the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98true progenitors\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of today\xe2\x80\x99s business corporations.  Friedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American Land Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Development 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33.  Were all of these silently excluded from the protections of the First Amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lack of a textual exception for speech by corporations cannot be explained on the ground that such organizations did not exist or did not speak.  To the contrary, colleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds had long been organized as corporations at common law and under the King\xe2\x80\x99s charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 455\xe2\x80\x93473 (1765); 1 S. Kyd, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations 1\xe2\x80\x9332, 63 (1793) (reprinted 2006), and as I have discussed, the practice of incorporation only expanded in the United States.  Both corporations and voluntary associations actively petitioned the Government and expressed their views in newspapers and pamphlets.  For example: An antislavery Quaker corporation petitioned the First Congress, distributed pamphlets, and communicated through the press in 1790.  W. diGiacomantonio, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the Gratification of a Volunteering Society\xe2\x80\x9d: Antislavery and Pressure Group Politics in the First Federal Congress, 15 J. Early Republic 169 (1995).  The New York Sons of Liberty sent a circular to colonies farther south in 1766.  P. Maier, From Resistance to Revolution 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (1972).  And the Society for the Relief and Instruction of Poor Germans circulated a biweekly paper from 1755 to 1757.  Adams, The Colonial German-language Press and the American Revolution, in The Press &amp; the American Revolution 151, 161\xe2\x80\x93162 (B. Bailyn &amp; J. Hench eds. 1980).  The dissent offers no evidence\xe2\x80\x94none whatever\xe2\x80\x94that the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s unqualified text was originally understood to exclude such associational speech from its protection.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historical evidence relating to the textually similar clause \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of . . . the press\xe2\x80\x9d also provides no support for the proposition that the First Amendment excludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope of its protection.  The freedom of \xe2\x80\x9cthe press\xe2\x80\x9d was widely understood to protect the publishing activities of individual editors and printers.  See <em>McIntyre</em> v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/334/index.html">514 U. S. 334</a>, 360 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also <em>McConnell, </em>540 U. S.<em>,</em> at 252\xe2\x80\x93253 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  But these individuals often acted through newspapers, which (much like corporations) had their own names, outlived the individuals who had founded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes owned by more than one person, and were operated for profit.  See generally F. Mott, American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through 250 Years 3\xe2\x80\x93164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom\xe2\x80\x99s Fetters (1956).  Their activities were not stripped of First Amendment protection simply because they were carried out under the banner of an artificial legal entity.  And the notion which follows from the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, that modern newspapers, since they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only at the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conception of corruption is unhistorical.  The Framers \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been appalled,\xe2\x80\x9d it says, by the evidence of corruption in the congressional findings supporting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.  <em>Post</em>, at 61.  For this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article arguing that \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d was originally understood to include \xe2\x80\x9cmoral decay\xe2\x80\x9d and even actions taken by citizens in pursuit of private rather than public ends.  Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 341, 373, 378 (2009).  It is hard to see how this has anything to do with what sort of corruption can be combated by restrictions on political speech.  Moreover, if speech can be prohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads to \xe2\x80\x9cmoral decay\xe2\x80\x9d or does not serve \xe2\x80\x9cpublic ends,\xe2\x80\x9d then there is no limit to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s censorship power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent says that when the Framers \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 37.  That is no doubt true.  All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and women\xe2\x80\x94not, for example, of trees or polar bears.  But the individual person\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak includes the right to speak <em>in association with other individual persons</em>.  Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of \xe2\x80\x9can individual American.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the speech of many individual Americans, who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party the right to speak on their behalf.  The association of individuals in a business corporation is no different\xe2\x80\x94or at least it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not \xe2\x80\x9can individual American.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But to return to, and summarize, my principal point, which is the conformity of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with the original meaning of the First Amendment.  The Amendment is written in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cspeech,\xe2\x80\x9d not speakers.  Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individuals\xe2\x80\x94and the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion.  We are therefore simply left with the question whether the speech at issue in this case is \xe2\x80\x9cspeech\xe2\x80\x9d covered by the First Amendment.  No one says otherwise.  A documentary film critical of a potential Presidential candidate is core political speech, and its nature as such does not change simply because it was funded by a corporation.  Nor does the character of that funding produce any reduction whatever in the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent worth of the speech\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cits capacity for informing the public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 777 (1978).  Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy.  We should celebrate rather than condemn the addition of this speech to the public debate.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas does not join Part IV of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent protests that 1791 rather than 1800 should be the relevant date, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ore than half of the century\xe2\x80\x99s total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 35, n. 53.

Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the rights of business corporations and the rights of non-business corporations is even more imaginative than finding a distinction between the rights of <em>all</em> corporations and the rights of other associations.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The best the dissent can come up with is that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ostratification practice\xe2\x80\x9d supports its reading of the First Amendment.  <em>Post</em>, at 40, n.\xc2\xa056.  For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White\xe2\x80\x99s statement (in dissent) that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>First Nat.

The sole authority Justice White cited for this proposition, <em>id.</em>, at 819, n.\xc2\xa014, was a law-review note that made no such claim.  To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing with the propriety of corporate political expenditures were \xe2\x80\x9cfew.\xe2\x80\x9d  Note, Corporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 821, 852 (1961).  More specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by a Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana.  <em>Id.</em>, at 852, n. 197.  Of course even if the common law was \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally interpreted\xe2\x80\x9d to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires, that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that <em>were</em> authorized by a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s charter could constitutionally be suppressed.  </p>\n<p>\n\nAs additional \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ostratification practice,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent notes that the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdid not recognize <em>any</em> First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 40, n.\xc2\xa056.  But it did that in <em>Grosjean</em> v. <em>American Press Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/233/index.html">297 U. S. 233</a> (1936), a case involving freedom of the press\xe2\x80\x94which the dissent acknowledges <em>did </em>cover corporations from the outset.  The relative recency of that first case is unsurprising.  All of our First Amendment jurisprudence was slow to develop.  We did not consider application of the First Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until 1919, see <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/249/47/index.html">249 U.

It is passing strange to interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech, or of the press\xe2\x80\x9d to mean, not everyone\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak or publish, but rather everyone\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak or the institutional press\xe2\x80\x99s right to publish.

Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets.  Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and promote <em>Hillary: The Movie</em> wherever and whenever it wanted to.  It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast <em>Hillary</em> at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election.  Neither Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s nor any other corporation\xe2\x80\x99s speech has been \xe2\x80\x9cbanned,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1.  All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for<font b="1"> broadcasts during the 30-day period.  The notion that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided.  Even more misguided is the notion that the Court must rewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by <em>for-profit</em> corporations and unions to decide this case.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic premise underlying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is its iteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s identity, including its \xe2\x80\x9cidentity\xe2\x80\x9d as a corporation.  While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law.  Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose.  It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC.  The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant.  Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it.  They cannot vote or run for office.  Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters.  The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process.  Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past.  Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864.  We have unanimously concluded that this \xe2\x80\x9creflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>FEC</em> v. <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/197/index.html"></a><a href="/us/459/197/index.html">459 U. S. 197</a>, 209 (1982) <em>(NRWC)</em>, and have accepted the \xe2\x80\x9clegislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 209\xe2\x80\x93210.  The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U.

Because departures from those rules always enhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of this case in some detail before explaining why the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis rests on a faulty understanding of <em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em> and of our campaign finance jurisprudence more generally\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  I regret the length of what follows, but the importance and novelty of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion require a full response.

In declaring \xc2\xa7203 of BCRA facially unconstitutional on the ground that corporations\xe2\x80\x99 electoral expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently than those of individuals, the majority decides this case on a basis relinquished below, not included in the questions presented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s invitation.  This procedure is unusual and inadvisable for a court.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Our colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are asked to reconsider Austin</em> and, in effect, <em>McConnell</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, would be more accurate if rephrased to state that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have asked ourselves\xe2\x80\x9d to reconsider those cases.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7203.  App. 23a\xe2\x80\x9324a.  In its motion for summary judgment, however, Citizens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge, 1:07\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x932240\xe2\x80\x93RCL\xe2\x80\x93RWR, Docket Entry No. 52, pp. 1\xe2\x80\x932 (May 16, 2008), and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of that claim, <em>id.</em>, Nos. 53 (May 22, 2008), 54 (May 23, 2008), App. 6a.  The District Court therefore resolved the case on alternative grounds,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and in its jurisdictional statement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised us that it was raising only \xe2\x80\x9can as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of \xe2\x80\xa6 BCRA \xc2\xa7203.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement 5.  The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited <em>Austin</em>, the key case the majority today overrules.  And not one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to \xc2\xa7203 that it previously agreed to dismiss.  In fact, not one of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s corporate status.  Juris. Statement (i).  Moreover, even in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected its request to overrule <em>Austin</em>, it never sought a declaration that \xc2\xa7203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corporations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute could not be applied to it because it was \xe2\x80\x9cfunded overwhelmingly by individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant 29; see also <em>id.,</em> at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d character of challenge to \xc2\xa7203); Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x939 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United conceding that \xc2\xa7203 could be applied to General Motors); <em>id.,</em> at 55 (counsel for Citizens United stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwe accept the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Youakim</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/231/index.html">425 U.

That is unsurprising, for none exists.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step, but it did not cure this fundamental problem.  Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>As-Applied and Facial Challenges</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acial challenges are disfavored.\xe2\x80\x9d  Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html"></a><a href="/us/552/442/index.html">552 U.

S. 491</a>, 504 (1985); alteration in original)).  By declaring \xc2\xa7203 facially unconstitutional, our colleagues have turned an as-applied challenge into a facial challenge, in defiance of this principle.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not merely a technical defect in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry \xe2\x80\x9crun[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U. S., at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Scanting that principle \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 451.  These concerns are heightened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the legislature has relied.  The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics.  It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of this on the basis of pure speculation.  Had Citizens United maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA \xc2\xa7203 can be applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed, through the normal process of litigation, a record about the <em>actual</em> effects of \xc2\xa7203, its actual burdens and its actual benefits, on<em> all</em> manner of corporations and unions.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cClaims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently \xe2\x80\x9craise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is nonexistent.  Congress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert.  The Court now negates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 efforts without a shred of evidence on how \xc2\xa7203 or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority throws up its hands.  Were we to confine our inquiry to Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied challenge, it protests, we would commence an \xe2\x80\x9cextended\xe2\x80\x9d process of \xe2\x80\x9cdraw[ing], and then redraw[ing], constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  While tacitly acknowledging that some applications of \xc2\xa7203 might be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a future in which novel First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad\xc2\xa0hoc basis, and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal restraint.  Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies, may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins.  The fluid nature of electioneering communications does not make this case special.  The fact that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some point down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied problems, does not come close to meeting the standard for a facial challenge.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority proposes several other justifications for the sweep of its ruling.  It suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because, if the Court were to continue on its normal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they present themselves, that process would itself<em> </em>run afoul of the First Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 9 (as-applied review process \xe2\x80\x9cwould raise questions as to the courts\xe2\x80\x99 own lawful authority\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cCourts, too, are bound by the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  This suggestion is perplexing.  Our colleagues elsewhere trumpet \xe2\x80\x9cour duty \xe2\x80\x98to say what the law is,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d even when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differently.  <em>Ante</em>, at 49 (quoting <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).  We do not typically say what the law <em>is not</em> as a hedge against future judicial error.  The possibility that later courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that provision.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 12, 16\xe2\x80\x9320.  In addition to begging the question what types of corporate spending are constitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim rests on the assertion that some significant number of corporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98censor[ship].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  That assertion is unsubstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experience.  It is particularly hard to square with the legal landscape following <em>WRTL</em>, which held that a corporate communication could be regulated under \xc2\xa7203 only if it was \xe2\x80\x9csusceptible of <em>no </em>reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (emphasis added).  The whole point of this test was to make \xc2\xa7203 as simple and speech-protective as possible.  The Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election cycle, it has determined The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s project to be a failure.  In this respect, too, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s critique of line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied review method generally.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless preserved it\xe2\x80\x94not as a freestanding \xe2\x80\x9cclaim,\xe2\x80\x9d but as a potential argument in support of \xe2\x80\x9ca claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13; see also <em>ante</em>, at 4 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (describing Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claim as: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Act violates the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  By this novel logic, virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as \xe2\x80\x9ca claim that the Government has violated my rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim\xe2\x80\x99s disposition.  Not only the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic relationship between litigants and courts, would be upended if the latter had free rein to construe the former\xe2\x80\x99s claims at such high levels of generality.  There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the rest to us.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is necessary as a matter of remedy.  Relying on a law review article, it asserts that Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the facial challenge does not prevent us \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied\xe2\x80\x9d cases.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon)); accord, <em>ante</em>, at 5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cRegardless whether we label Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s claim a \xe2\x80\x98facial\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99 challenge, the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision are the same\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority is on firmer conceptual ground here.  Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor Fallon\xe2\x80\x99s thesis, one must proceed to ask <em>which </em>as-applied challenges, if successful, will \xe2\x80\x9cproperly\xe2\x80\x9d invite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as this carries the necessary implication that all future as-applied challenges to the provision must prevail.  See Fallon 1339\xe2\x80\x931340.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied challenge was not of this sort.  Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention was that BCRA \xc2\xa7203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature-length video-on-demand film (such as <em>Hillary</em>) or to a nonprofit corporation exempt from taxation under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7501(c)(4)[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] and funded overwhelmingly by individuals (such as itself).  See Brief for Appellant 16\xe2\x80\x9341.  Success on either of these claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the validity of \xc2\xa7203 as applied to other types of broadcasts, other types of corporations, or unions.  It certainly would not invalidate the statute as applied to a large for-profit corporation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is \xe2\x80\x9ca small, nonprofit organization, which is very much like [an <em>MCFL </em>corporation],\xe2\x80\x9d and affirming that its argument \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely would not be the same\xe2\x80\x9d if <em>Hillary </em>were distributed by General Motors).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>Narrower Grounds</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes and precedents.  Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another \xe2\x80\x9ccardinal\xe2\x80\x9d principle of the judicial process: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\xe2\x80\x9d PDK Labs., Inc.</em> v. <em>Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F.\xc2\xa03d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision that the majority has bypassed.  First, the Court could have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify as an \xe2\x80\x9celectioneering communication\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7203 of BCRA, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b.  BCRA defines that term to encompass certain communications transmitted by \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcast, cable, or satellite.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7434(f)(3)(A).  When Congress was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very different sort of programming: short advertisements run on television or radio.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 207.  The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on-demand transmissions.  See Brief for Senator John McCain et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  In light of this ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on-demand, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he elementary rule \xe2\x80\xa6 that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hooper</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/155/648/index.html">155 U. S. 648</a>, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably ruled that \xc2\xa7203 does not apply to <em>Hillary</em>.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court could have expanded the <em>MCFL </em>exemption to cover \xc2\xa7501(c)(4) nonprofits that accept only a <em>de minimis </em>amount of money from for-profit corporations.  Citizens United professes to be such a group: Its brief says it \xe2\x80\x9cis funded predominantly by donations from individuals who support [its] ideological message.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant 5.  Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that <em>de minimis </em>business support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise qualifying organization from the ambit of <em>MCFL</em>.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  This Court could have simply followed their lead.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, let us not forget Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied constitutional challenge.  Precisely because Citizens United looks so much like the <em>MCFL</em> organizations we have exempted from regulation, while a feature-length video-on-demand film<em> </em>looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation, this challenge is a substantial one.  As the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s own arguments show, the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must always be treated identically\xe2\x80\x94and always spared expenditures restrictions\xe2\x80\x94in the political realm.  Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review process that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation since <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976) <em>(per curiam)</em>,<em> </em>and that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in <em>WRTL</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html">551 U.

There was also the straightforward path: applying <em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em>, just as the District Court did in holding that the funding of Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s film can be regulated under them.  The only thing preventing the majority from affirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower ground that would retain <em>Austin</em>, is its disdain for <em>Austin</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is the most transparent: <em>stare decisis</em>.  I am not an absolutist when it comes to <em>stare decisis</em>, in the campaign finance area or in any other.  No one is.  But if this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law, it must at least demand a significant justification, beyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning settled doctrine.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a>, 864 (1992).  No such justification exists in this case, and to the contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our precedents.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s central argument for why <em>stare decisis </em>ought to be trumped is that it does not like <em>Austin</em>.  The opinion \xe2\x80\x9cwas not well reasoned,\xe2\x80\x9d our colleagues assert, and it conflicts with First Amendment principles.  <em>Ante</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  This, of course, is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s merits argument, the many defects in which we will soon consider.  I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it.  But neither is true of <em>Austin</em>, as I explain at length in Parts III and IV, <em>infra</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9389, and restating a merits argument with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in the <em>stare decisis </em>calculus.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supplements its merits case with a smattering of assertions.  The Court proclaims that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Austin</em> is undermined by experience since its announcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is a curious claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record.  The majority has no empirical evidence with which to substantiate the claim; we just have its <em>ipse dixit</em> that the real world has not been kind to <em>Austin</em>.  Nor does the majority bother to specify in what sense <em>Austin </em>has been \xe2\x80\x9cundermined.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs: \xe2\x80\x9cOur Nation\xe2\x80\x99s speech dynamic is changing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 48; \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[c]orporations \xe2\x80\xa6 do not have monolithic views,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>How any of these ruminations weakens the force of <em>stare decisis</em>, escapes my comprehension.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also contends that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation to rely on <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale \xe2\x80\x9cdiminishe[s]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of adhering to that precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 48; see also <em>ante</em>, at 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (Government\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position is \xe2\x80\x9cmost importan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d factor undermining <em>Austin</em>).  Why it diminishes the value of <em>stare decisis</em> is left unexplained.  We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack.  Nor should we.  Our decisions can often be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may have strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing only a subset of them.  Members of the public, moreover, often rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our precise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been regulating corporate electioneering since <em>Austin</em>.  The task of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the majority opinion spends several pages making these surprising arguments, it says almost nothing about the standard considerations we have used to determine <em>stare decisis </em>value, such as the antiquity of the precedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reliance interests at stake.  It is also conspicuously silent about <em>McConnell</em>, even though the <em>McConnell </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to uphold BCRA \xc2\xa7203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of <em>Austin </em>but also on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s historical pedigree, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 540 U. S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93132, 223\xe2\x80\x93224, and the need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns, see <em>id.,</em> at 126\xe2\x80\x93129, 205\xe2\x80\x93208, and n.\xc2\xa088.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[s]tare decisis</em> has special force when legislators or citizens \xe2\x80\x98have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hubbard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/695/index.html">514 U.

S. 197</a>, 202 (1991)).  <em>Stare decisis</em> protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise.  State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in <em>Austin</em>, for more than a century.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on <em>Austin</em> throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA.  The total record it compiled was <em>100,000 pages</em> long.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By removing one of its central components, today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling makes a hash out of BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate and interconnected regulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> </em>540 U. S., at 172.  Consider just one example of the distortions that will follow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or spending \xe2\x80\x9csoft money,\xe2\x80\x9d funds that are not subject to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements or its source and amount limitations.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441i; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 122\xe2\x80\x93126.  Going forward, corporations and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific candidates, whereas national parties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of any kind.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of corporations and unions\xe2\x80\x94and the narrow interests they represent\xe2\x80\x94vis-\xc3\x80-vis the role of political parties\xe2\x80\x94and the broad coalitions they represent\xe2\x80\x94in determining who will hold public office.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other <em>stare decisis </em>factors also cut against the Court.<font b="1">  Considerations of antiquity are significant for similar reasons.  <em>McConnell</em> is only six years old, but <em>Austin </em>has been on the books for two decades, and many of the statutes called into question by today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion have been on the books for a half-century or more.  The Court points to no intervening change in circumstances that warrants revisiting <em>Austin</em>.  Certainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided <em>WRTL </em>two Terms ago.  And the Court gives no reason to think that <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> are unworkable.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, no one has argued to us that <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule has proved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corporation, union, or State has asked us to overrule it.  Quite to the contrary, leading groups representing the business community,[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] organized labor,[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] and the nonprofit sector,[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] together with more than half of the States,[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>] urge that we preserve <em>Austin</em>.  As for <em>McConnell</em>,<em> </em>the portions of BCRA it upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Government have worked to make \xc2\xa7203 as user-friendly as possible.  For instance, Congress established a special mechanism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see note following 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7437h; the FEC has established a standardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors, for corporations to claim that a particular electioneering communication is permissible under <em>WRTL</em>, see 11 CFR \xc2\xa7114.15 (2009);[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] and, as noted above, The Chief Justice crafted his controlling opinion in <em>WRTL</em> with the express goal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U. S., at 469\xe2\x80\x93470, 473\xe2\x80\x93474.  The case for <em>stare decisis </em>may be bolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings \xe2\x80\x9chave reduced the impact\xe2\x80\x9d of a precedent \xe2\x80\x9cwhile reaffirming the decision\xe2\x80\x99s core ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U.

Virtually every one of its arguments was made and rejected in those cases, and the majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents.  The only relevant thing that has changed since <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> is the composition of this Court.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of <em>stare decisis</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cpermits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vasquez</em> v. <em>Hillery</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/254/index.html">474 U.

The ruling rests on several premises.  First, the Court claims that <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> have \xe2\x80\x9cbanned\xe2\x80\x9d corporate speech.  Second, it claims that the First Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on speaker identity, including the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s identity as a corporation.  Third, it claims that <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> were radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our campaign finance jurisprudence.

Indeed, the majority invokes the specter of a \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d on nearly every page of its opinion.  <em>Ante,</em> at 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45, 46, 47, 49, 54, 56.  This characterization is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact it already has been.  Our cases have repeatedly pointed out that, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontrary to the [majority\xe2\x80\x99s] critical assumptions,\xe2\x80\x9d the statutes upheld in <em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em> do \xe2\x80\x9cnot impose an <em>absolute</em> ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660; see also <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93204; <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162\xe2\x80\x93163.  For starters, both statutes provide exemptions for PACs, separate segregated funds established by a corporation for political purposes.  See 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7169.255 (West 2005).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe ability to form and administer separate segregated funds,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed in <em>McConnell</em>, \xe2\x80\x9chas provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.  That has been this Court\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous view.\xe2\x80\x9d  540 U. S., at 203.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under BCRA, any corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families\xe2\x80\x9d can pool their resources to finance electioneering communications.  2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(b)(4)(A)(i).  A significant and growing number of corporations avail themselves of this option;[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] during the most recent election cycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion dollars.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  Administering a PAC entails some administrative burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer,<font b="1"> disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds, see <em>ante</em>, at 51, and no one has suggested that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit corporation.  To the extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is, just the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own unsupported factfinding, see <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  Like all other natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form.  The owners of a \xe2\x80\x9cmom &amp; pop\xe2\x80\x9d store can simply place ads in their own names, rather than the store\xe2\x80\x99s.  If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form, they may utilize an <em>MCFL </em>organization that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit for business or union interests.  See <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263\xe2\x80\x93264.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The laws upheld in <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell </em>leave open many additional avenues for corporations\xe2\x80\x99 political speech.  Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluating in this case, BCRA \xc2\xa7203.  It has no application to genuine issue advertising\xe2\x80\x94a category of corporate speech Congress found to be far more substantial than election-related advertising, see <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 207\xe2\x80\x94or to Internet, telephone, and print advocacy.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Like numerous statutes, it exempts media companies\xe2\x80\x99 news stories, commentaries, and editorials from its electioneering restrictions, in recognition of the unique role played by the institutional press in sustaining public debate.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  See 2 U.

It applies in a viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office, made during discrete time periods through discrete channels.  In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast <em>Hillary </em>right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC, which by its own account is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most active conservative PACs in America,\xe2\x80\x9d Citizens United Political Victory Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/.[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So let us be clear: Neither <em>Austin </em>nor <em>McConnell</em> held or implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a \xe2\x80\x9ccensor\xe2\x80\x9d; and in the years since these cases were decided, corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue.  Laws such as \xc2\xa7203 target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process, that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens, and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it.  Such laws burden political speech, and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scrutiny.

The First Amendment provides that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law \xe2\x80\xa6 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the press, that text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind.  Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that speech can be regulated differentially on account of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s identity, when identity is understood in categorical or institutional terms.  The Government routinely places special restrictions on the speech rights of students,[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>] prisoners,[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>] members of the Armed Forces,[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>] foreigners,[<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>] and its own employees.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  When such restrictions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest, they do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  In contrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses, our cases recognize that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests may be more or less compelling with respect to different classes of speakers,[<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>] cf. <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co.</em> v. <em>Minnesota Comm\xe2\x80\x99r of Revenue</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/575/index.html">460 U.

It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine has \xe2\x80\x9cfrowned on\xe2\x80\x9d certain identity-based distinctions, <em>Los Angeles Police Dept.</em> v. <em>United Reporting Publishing Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/32/index.html">528 U.

But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or content.  Not even close.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely guards political speech.  But in this context, too, the authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled.  We have, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to exclude independent candidates from televised debates.  <em>Arkansas Ed. Television Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Forbes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/666/index.html">523 U.

S. 191</a> (1992).[<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]  Although we have not reviewed them directly, we have never cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nationals.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441e(a)(1).  And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees, but not others, from contributing to or participating in political activities.  See n.\xc2\xa045, <em>supra</em>.  These statutes burden the political expression of one class of speakers, namely, civil servants.  Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and Congress\xe2\x80\x99 reasoned judgment that certain regulations which leave \xe2\x80\x9cuntouched full participation \xe2\x80\xa6 in political decisions at the ballot box,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Letter Carriers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/index.html"></a><a href="/us/413/548/index.html">413 U.

As we have unanimously observed, legislatures are entitled to decide \xe2\x80\x9cthat the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation\xe2\x80\x9d in an electoral context.  <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U. S., at 209\xe2\x80\x93210.[<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized, but within the area of campaign finance, corporate spending is also \xe2\x80\x9cfurthest from the core of political expression, since corporations\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 161, n.\xc2\xa08 (citation omitted).  Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because the \xe2\x80\x9cspeakers\xe2\x80\x9d are not natural persons, much less members of our political community, and the governmental interests are of the highest order.  Furthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished from noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimination or political favoritism. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If taken seriously, our colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 assumption that the identity of a speaker has <em>no</em> relevance to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions.  Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by \xe2\x80\x9cTokyo Rose\xe2\x80\x9d during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders.  More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98enhance the relative voice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of some (<em>i.e.</em>, humans) over others (<em>i.e.</em>, nonhumans).  <em>Ante</em>, at 33 (quoting <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

Those few corporations that existed at the founding were authorized by grant of a special legislative charter.[<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>]  Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature, and the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter that specified the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s powers and purposes and \xe2\x80\x9cauthoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate organization,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cthe internal structure of the corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d  J.

Unlike our colleagues, they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.[<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights, business corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends.  Even \xe2\x80\x9cthe notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,\xe2\x80\x9d given that \xe2\x80\x9cat the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate Speech, 18 Hastings Const.

In light of these background practices and understandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers believed \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d would extend equally to all corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to guard against corporate capture of elections.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse intellectual sources, communicated through newspapers, and aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed in England.  <em>Ante</em>, at 37.  From these (accurate) observations, the Court concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society\xe2\x80\x99s most salient media.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This conclusion is far from certain, given that many historians believe the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication and did not understand the First Amendment to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent the subsequent punishment of such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Near</em> v. <em>Minnesota ex rel.

Yet, even if the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion were correct, it would tell us only that the First Amendment was understood to protect political speech <em>in</em> certain media.  It would tell us little about whether the Amendment was understood to protect general treasury electioneering expenditures <em>by</em> corporations, <em>and to what extent</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a matter of original expectations, then, it seems absurd to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor of electoral advocacy.  As a matter of original meaning, it likewise seems baseless\xe2\x80\x94unless one evaluates the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 1, 48, or its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), at such a high level of generality that the historical understandings of the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judicial task.  This case sheds a revelatory light on the assumption of some that an impartial judge\xe2\x80\x99s application of an originalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the decisional process, than his or her views about sound policy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia criticizes the foregoing discussion for failing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that corporations were understood to be excluded from the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s free speech guarantee.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 9.  Of course, Justice Scalia adduces no statements to suggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that the contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right that the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause thought they were enshrining.  Although Justice Scalia makes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak entails a right to speak with others for a common cause, cf. <em>MCFL</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html">479 U.

Nothing in his account dislodges my basic point that members of the founding generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they \xe2\x80\x9cdespised\xe2\x80\x9d corporations, <em>ante</em>, at 2), and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms.  If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech, that may well be because the contrary proposition\xe2\x80\x94if not also the very notion of \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate speech\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was inconceivable.[<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia also emphasizes the unqualified nature of the First Amendment text.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2, 8.  Yet he would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally?  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.[<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>]  Like virtually all modern lawyers, Justice Scalia presumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Executive, even though its language refers to Congress alone.  In any event, the text only leads us back to the questions who or what is guaranteed \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom of speech,\xe2\x80\x9d and, just as critically, what that freedom consists of and under what circumstances it may be limited.  Justice Scalia appears to believe that because corporations are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as night the day) that their electioneering must be equally protected by the First Amendment and equally immunized from expenditure limits.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  That conclusion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and Justice Scalia fails to explain why the original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA \xc2\xa7203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amendment.[<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>]  I have given several reasons why I believe the Constitution would have been understood then, and ought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restrictions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many more reasons in the pages to come.  The Court enlists the Framers in its defense without seriously grappling with their understandings of corporations or the free speech right, or with the republican principles that underlay those understandings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has never attended very closely to the views of the Framers, see <em>Randall</em> v. <em>Sorrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/230/index.html"></a><a href="/us/548/230/index.html">548 U. S. 230</a>, 280 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting), whose political universe differed profoundly from that of today.  We have long since held that corporations are covered by the First Amendment, and many legal scholars have long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation.  But \xe2\x80\x9chistorical context is usually relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted), and in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s effort to cast itself as guardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.  To the contrary, this history helps illuminate just how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.</p>\n<p align="left">2.  <em>Legislative and Judicial Interpretation</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition.  At the federal level, the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corporate contributions to candidates.  The Senate Report on the legislation observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure.  It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906).  President Roosevelt, in his 1905 annual message to Congress, declared:</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders\xe2\x80\x99 money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States</em> v. <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/352/567/index.html"></a><a href="/us/352/567/index.html">352 U. S. 567</a>, 572 (1957) (quoting 40 Cong. Rec. 96).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the Tillman Act several times, see <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 508\xe2\x80\x93510 (Souter, J., dissenting); <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 115; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570\xe2\x80\x93575, and I will refrain from doing so again.  It is enough to say that the Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first, the enormous power corporations had come to wield in federal elections, with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and a public perception of corruption; and second, a respect for the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the use of their money to support candidates they opposed.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>CIO</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/106/index.html"></a><a href="/us/335/106/index.html">335 U.

L.\xc2\xa0J. 871 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over the years, the limitations on corporate political spending have been modified in a number of ways, as Congress responded to changes in the American economy and political practices that threatened to displace the commonweal.  Justice Souter recently traced these developments at length.[<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>]  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 507\xe2\x80\x93519 (dissenting opinion); see also <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93133; <em>McConnell</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 188\xe2\x80\x93205.  The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case.  In that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress extended the prohibition on corporate support of candidates to cover not only direct contributions, but independent expenditures as well.  Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, \xc2\xa7304, 61 Stat. 159.  The bar on contributions \xe2\x80\x9cwas being so narrowly construed\xe2\x80\x9d that corporations were easily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting candidates through other means.  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (1947)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions, even though the Court declined to pass on its constitutionality.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  Two features of these cases are of far greater relevance.  First, those Justices were writing separately; which is to say, their position failed to command a majority.  Prior to today, this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents.  Second, each case in this line expressed support for the principle that corporate and union political speech financed with PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organization\xe2\x80\x99s stockholders or members, receives greater protection than speech financed with general treasury funds.[<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, which retained the restriction on using general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures, 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b(a).  FECA codified the option for corporations and unions to create PACs to finance contributions and expenditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself.  \xc2\xa7441b(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on corporate contributions and expenditures had become such an accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation that when a large number of plaintiffs, including several nonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of the Act in <em>Buckley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, no one even bothered to argue that the bar as such was unconstitutional.  <em>Buckley </em>famously (or infamously) distinguished direct contributions from independent expenditures, <em>id.,</em> at 58\xe2\x80\x9359, but its silence on corporations only reinforced the understanding that corporate expenditures could be treated differently from individual expenditures.  \xe2\x80\x9cSince our decision in <em>Buckley</em>, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that Congress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting nonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ccareful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cautious advance, step by step, to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations \xe2\x80\xa6 warrants considerable deference,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe governmental interest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected representatives has long been recognized,\xe2\x80\x9d the unanimous Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is no reason why it may not \xe2\x80\xa6 be accomplished by treating \xe2\x80\xa6 corporations \xe2\x80\xa6 differently from individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 210\xe2\x80\x93211.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the expenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonprofit corporation.  In <em>MCFL</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/238/index.html">479 U.

S., at 209\xe2\x80\x93210), and again we acknowledged that the Government has a legitimate interest in \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[ing] the substantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form,\xe2\x80\x9d 479 U.

Those aggregations can distort the \xe2\x80\x9cfree trade in ideas\xe2\x80\x9d crucial to candidate elections, <em>ibid.</em>, at the expense of members or shareholders who may disagree with the object of the expenditures, <em>id.</em>, at 260 (internal quotation marks omitted).  What the Court held by a 5-to-4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures, because Congress\xe2\x80\x99 interests in protecting shareholders and \xe2\x80\x9crestrict[ing] \xe2\x80\x98the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 257 (quoting <em>FEC</em> v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Comm.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/480/index.html">470 U.

They would have recognized congressional authority to bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe threat from corporate political activity will vary depending on the particular characteristics of a given corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d but believed these \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions among corporations\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctions in degree,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cin kind,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cmore properly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 U.

Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of corporate political speech could be no more stringent than of speech by an individual.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four years later, in <em>Austin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html"></a><a href="/us/494/652/index.html">494 U.

We held they could be.  Once again recognizing the importance of \xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of the marketplace of political ideas\xe2\x80\x9d in candidate elections, <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U.

In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have on the political process, <em>ibid.</em>, we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations\xe2\x80\x99 PACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus \xe2\x80\x9creflect actual public support for the political ideals espoused by corporations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.  </em>Notwithstanding our colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 insinuations that <em>Austin </em>deprived the public of general \xe2\x80\x9cideas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfacts,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, the decision<em> </em>addressed only candidate-focused expenditures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate spending on other matters. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 20 years since <em>Austin</em>, we have reaffirmed its holding and rationale a number of times, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b), even though that restriction had been on the books for decades before <em>Buckley </em>and would remain on the books, undisturbed, for decades after.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case on which the majority places even greater weight than <em>Buckley</em>, however, is <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html"></a><a href="/us/435/765/index.html">435 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance is odd.  The only thing about <em>Bellotti</em> that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position.  <em>Bellotti</em> ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding, that \xe2\x80\x9cour consideration of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\xe2\x80\x9d  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26; see also <em>id.,</em> at 787\xe2\x80\x93788 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving public confidence in Government and protecting dissenting shareholders may be \xe2\x80\x9cweighty \xe2\x80\xa6 in the context of partisan candidate elections\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Bellotti</em>, in other words, did not touch the question presented in <em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em>, and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority attempts to explain away the distinction <em>Bellotti </em>drew\xe2\x80\x94between general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office\xe2\x80\x94as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with <em>Buckley</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 31, 42\xe2\x80\x9344.  Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections, the \xe2\x80\x9cimportance\xe2\x80\x9d of which \xe2\x80\x9chas never been doubted,\xe2\x80\x9d 435 U. S., at 788, n.\xc2\xa026, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda.  A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation.  Cf. <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring); <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing</em> v. <em>Berkeley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/290/index.html">454 U. S. 290</a>, 299 (1981).  The majority likewise overlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases have repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinction.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 659; <em>NCPAC</em>, 470 U. S., at 495\xe2\x80\x93496; <em>FCC</em> v. <em>League of Women Voters of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/364/index.html">468 U. S. 364</a>, 371, n.\xc2\xa09 (1984); <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U. S., at 210, n.\xc2\xa07.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s critique of <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote 26 puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate <em>Bellotti</em> to canonical status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with <em>Buckley</em>.  <em>Bellotti</em>, apparently, is both the font of all wisdom and internally incoherent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Bellotti</em> Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a state statute that barred business corporations\xe2\x80\x99 expenditures on some referenda but not others.  Specifically, the statute barred a business corporation \xe2\x80\x9cfrom making contributions or expenditures \xe2\x80\x98for the purpose of \xe2\x80\xa6 influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55, \xc2\xa78 (West Supp. 1977); alteration in original), and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>435 U. S., at 768.  As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax.  The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters.  See <em>id.,</em> at 769\xe2\x80\x93770, and n.\xc2\xa03.  We said that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere, as here, the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 785\xe2\x80\x93786 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bellotti</em> thus involved a <em>viewpoint-discriminatory </em>statute, created to effect a particular policy outcome.  Even Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that \xe2\x80\x9ca very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 827, n.\xc2\xa06.  To make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs.  <em>Id.,</em> at 768, n.\xc2\xa02 (opinion of the Court).  This really was a complete ban on a specific, preidentified subject.  See <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 259, n.\xc2\xa012 (stating that 2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7441b\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure restriction \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>of course distinguishable</em> from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in the state referendum context in \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>Bellotti</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority grasps a quotational straw from <em>Bellotti</em>, that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corporation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  Of course not, but no one suggests the contrary and neither <em>Austin</em> nor <em>McConnell</em> held otherwise.  They held that even though the expenditures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a compelling state interest.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 658, 660.  We acknowledged in <em>Bellotti</em> that numerous \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of the highest importance\xe2\x80\x9d can justify campaign finance regulation.  435 U. S., at 788\xe2\x80\x93789.  But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 789.  We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been \xe2\x80\x9crecord or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em>, then, sit perfectly well with <em>Bellotti</em>.  Indeed, all six Members of the <em>Austin</em> majority had been on the Court at the time of <em>Bellotti</em>, and none so much as hinted in <em>Austin</em> that they saw any tension between the decisions.  The difference between the cases is not that <em>Austin</em> and <em>McConnell</em> rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas <em>Bellotti</em> accepted it.  The difference is that the statute at issue in <em>Bellotti </em>smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]reserv[e] the integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, \xe2\x80\xa6 sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d protect the expressive interests of shareholders, and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]reserv[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 the individual citizen\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in government.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U.

These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570\xe2\x80\x93575, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, see <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting), FECA in 1971, see <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U.

Continuously for over 100 years, this line of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Time and again, we have recognized these realities in approving measures that Congress and the States have taken.  None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary.  The only thing new about <em>Austin</em> was the dissent, with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in which to revisit <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> and why these decisions sit perfectly well with \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment principles,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1, 48, I come at last to the interests that are at stake.  The majority recognizes that <em>Austin </em>and <em>McConnell</em> may be defended on anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales.  <em>Ante</em>, at<em> </em>32\xe2\x80\x9346.  It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales, which overlap and complement each other, and in applying them to the case at hand.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>The Anticorruption Interest</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Undergirding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the merits is the claim that the only \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d is one that is \xe2\x80\x9climited to quid pro quo</em> corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 43.  This is the same \xe2\x80\x9ccrabbed view of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d that was espoused by Justice Kennedy in <em>McConnell</em> and squarely rejected by the Court in that case.  540 U. S., at 152.  While it is true that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the approach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my judgment.  It disregards our constitutional history and the fundamental demands of a democratic society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undue influence on an officeholder\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and from creating \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the appearance of such influence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the sphere of <em>quid pro quo </em>relationships.  <em>Id.,</em> at 150; see also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 143\xe2\x80\x93144, 152\xe2\x80\x93154; <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 441; <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 389.  Corruption can take many forms.  Bribery may be the paradigm case.  But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind.  And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Corruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s apparent belief that <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics.  It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each other\xe2\x80\x99s backs\xe2\x80\x94and which amply supported Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record.  In a careful analysis, Judge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the corrupting consequences of corporate and union independent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 555\xe2\x80\x93560, 622\xe2\x80\x93625; see also <em>id.,</em> at 804\xe2\x80\x93805, 813, n.\xc2\xa0143 (Leon, J.) (indicating agreement).  As summarized in her own words:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members\xe2\x80\x99 elections.  The record also indicates that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election-related advertisements.  Indeed, Members of Congress are particularly grateful when negative issue advertisements are run by these organizations, leaving the candidates free to run positive advertisements and be seen as \xe2\x80\x98above the fray.\xe2\x80\x99  Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, when they are being run, and where they are being run.  Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Findings also demonstrate that Members of Congress seek to have corporations and unions run these advertisements on their behalf.  The Findings show that Members suggest that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups with the understanding that the money contributed to these groups will assist the Member in a campaign.  After the election, these organizations often seek credit for their support\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Finally, a large majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 623\xe2\x80\x93624 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge Kollar-Kotelly seemed to have a <em>quid pro quo</em> basis, but other arrangements were more subtle.  Her analysis shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of the <em>quid pro quo</em> category, as well as the adverse consequences that <em>all </em>such arrangements may have.  There are threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society than the odd bribe.  Yet the majority\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but the most discrete abuses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our \xe2\x80\x9cundue influence\xe2\x80\x9d cases have allowed the American people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat officeholders will decide issues \xe2\x80\xa6 on the merits or the desires of their constituencies,\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or expenditures\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvalued by the officeholder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 153.[<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]  When private interests are seen to exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account of the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns, the result can depart so thoroughly \xe2\x80\x9cfrom what is pure or correct\xe2\x80\x9d in the conduct of Government, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 512 (1966) (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d), that it amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9csubversion \xe2\x80\xa6 of the electoral process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 575.  At stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Government but also the public\xe2\x80\x99s faith therein, not only \xe2\x80\x9cthe capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents [but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U.

Ill. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 599, 601.  Long before <em>Buckley</em>, we appreciated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard \xe2\x80\xa6 an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burroughs</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/index.html">290 U.

And whereas we have no evidence to support the notion that the Framers would have wanted corporations to have the same rights as natural persons in the electoral context, we have ample evidence to suggest that they would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance.  It is fair to say that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d Teachout 348, which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests, see <em>id.,</em> at 373\xe2\x80\x93374; see also <em>Randall</em>, 548 U.

Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption interest most narrowly, we have never suggested that such <em>quid pro quo</em> debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct crimes.  Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of, some outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder.  See <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 143 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges.

The opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering only express advocacy (<em>i.e.</em>, magic words) would likely be ineffectual, <em>ibid.</em>, a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe independent advocacy restricted by [FECA \xc2\xa7608(e)(1)] <em>does not presently appear </em>to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 46 (emphasis added).  <em>Buckley </em>expressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at a later date, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it may be that, in some circumstances, \xe2\x80\x98large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 478 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (quoting <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45).  Certainly <em>Buckley </em>did not foreclose this possibility with respect to electioneering communications made with corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had no occasion to consider.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Austin</em> Court did not rest its holding on <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption, as it found the broader corruption implicated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a sufficient basis for Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on corporate electioneering.  494 U. S., at 658\xe2\x80\x93660.  Concurring in that opinion, I took the position that \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger of either the fact, or the appearance, of <em>quid pro quo</em> relationships [also] provides an adequate justification for state regulation\xe2\x80\x9d of these independent expenditures.  <em>Id.,</em> at 678.  I did not see this position as inconsistent with <em>Buckley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of individual expenditures.  Corporations, as a class, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny; they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy access and votes.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1 trillion during the last election cycle).  Business corporations must engage the political process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value.  The unparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups) spend unrestricted sums on elections.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now say that time has borne out my concerns.  The legislative and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corporations grew more and more adept at crafting \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads\xe2\x80\x9d to help or harm a particular candidate, these nominally independent expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very direct sense.  The sponsors of these ads were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over; \xe2\x80\x9ccandidates and officials knew who their friends were,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 129.  Many corporate independent expenditures, it seemed, had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements.  In an age in which money and television ads are the coin of the campaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influence over, public officials.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA record does not contain \xe2\x80\x9cdirect examples of votes being exchanged for \xe2\x80\xa6 expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 45 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It would have been quite remarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such behavior by its own Members.  Proving that a specific vote was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been next to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motivations, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote.  Yet, even if \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ngratiation and access \xe2\x80\xa6 are not corruption\xe2\x80\x9d themselves, <em>ibid.</em>, they are necessary prerequisites to it; they can create both the opportunity for, and the appearance of, <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements.  The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of <em>quid pro quo</em> deals: threats, both explicit and implicit.  Starting today, corporations with large war chests to deploy on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their interests.  The majority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record provides \xe2\x80\x9conly scant evidence that independent expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 ingratiate,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, \xe2\x80\x9cin any event,\xe2\x80\x9d none of it matters.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly documented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained its significance under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s own touchstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption rationale, <em>Buckley</em>.  See <em>McConnell,</em> 251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 555\xe2\x80\x93560, 622\xe2\x80\x93625.  Witnesses explained how political parties and candidates used corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chard-money\xe2\x80\x9d limitations.  See, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 478\xe2\x80\x93479.<em> </em> One former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]andidates whose campaigns benefit from [phony \xe2\x80\x9cissue ads\xe2\x80\x9d] greatly appreciate the help of these groups.  In fact, Members will also be favorably disposed to those who finance these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending legislation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers).  One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontroverted testimony, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unregulated expenditures\xe2\x80\x94whether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad campaigns\xe2\x80\x94can sometimes generate <em>far more </em>influence than direct campaign contributions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting declaration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added).  In sum, Judge Kollar-Kotelly found, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record powerfully demonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with the general treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears those entities to elected officials in a way that could be perceived by the public as corrupting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 622\xe2\x80\x93623.  She concluded that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept was defined in <em>Buckley</em>, was itself sufficient to uphold BCRA \xc2\xa7203.  251 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 622\xe2\x80\x93625.  Judge Leon agreed.  See <em>id.,</em> at 804\xe2\x80\x93805 (dissenting only with re-\nspect to the Wellstone Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of <em>MCFL </em>corporations).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the <em>McConnell </em>Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court regarding \xc2\xa7203, we did not rest our holding on a narrow notion of <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.  Instead we relied on the governmental interest in combating the unique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as recognized in <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales, 540 U. S., at 205 (citing <em>Austin,</em> 494 U. S., at 660), as well as the interest in preventing circumvention of contribution limits, 540 U. S., at 128\xe2\x80\x93129, 205, 206, n.\xc2\xa088.  Had we felt constrained by the view of today\xe2\x80\x99s Court that <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption and its appearance are the only interests that count in this field, <em>ante</em>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9346, we of course would have looked closely at that issue.  And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly reflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found one or both of those interests satisfied and \xc2\xa7203 appropriately tailored to them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of the <em>Buckley</em> anticorruption rationale on the ground that independent corporate expenditures \xe2\x80\x9cdo not give rise to [<em>quid pro quo</em>] corruption or the appearance of corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 42, is thus unfair as well as unreasonable.  Congress and outside experts have generated significant evidence corroborating this rationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the relevant materials before us is that the Government had no reason to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge the plaintiff had abandoned.  The Court cannot both <em>sU. S.onte </em>choose to relitigate <em>McConnell</em> on appeal and then complain that the Government has failed to substantiate its case.  If our colleagues were really serious about the interest in preventing <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption, they would remand to the District Court with instructions to commence evidentiary proceedings.[<a href="#F66" name="T66">Footnote 66</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The insight that even technically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions is bolstered by our decision last year in <em>Caperton</em> v. <em>A. T. Massey Coal Co.,</em> 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  In that case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a corporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Virginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular candidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that court.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to \xe2\x80\x98And For The Sake Of The Kids,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa7527 corporation that ran ads targeting Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s opponent.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2).  \xe2\x80\x9cThis was not all.  Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cto support \xe2\x80\xa6 Brent Benjamin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933) (second alteration in original).  Applying its common sense, this Court accepted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias\xe2\x80\x9d when Benjamin later declined to recuse himself from the appeal by Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s corporation.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 11).  \xe2\x80\x9cThough n[o] \xe2\x80\xa6 bribe or criminal influence\xe2\x80\x9d was involved, we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cJustice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulties of inquiring into actual bias,\xe2\x80\x9d we further noted, \xe2\x80\x9csimply underscore the need for objective rules,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 13)\xe2\x80\x94rules which will perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its actual existence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Caperton</em>, then, we accepted the premise that, at least in some circumstances, independent expenditures on candidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of <em>quid pro quo</em> corruption.  Indeed, this premise struck the Court as so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship\xe2\x80\x99s spending on behalf of Benjamin\xe2\x80\x94spending that consisted of 99.97% independent expenditures ($3 million) and 0.03% direct contributions ($1,000)\xe2\x80\x94as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 1) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe basis for the [recusal] motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from\xe2\x80\x9d Blankenship); <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 3) (referencing \xe2\x80\x9cBlankenship\xe2\x80\x99s $3 million in contributions\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9cBlankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace him with Benjamin\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\xe2\x80\x9cBlankenship\xe2\x80\x99s campaign contributions \xe2\x80\xa6 had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome\xe2\x80\x9d).  The reason the Court so thoroughly conflated expenditures and contributions, one assumes, is that it realized that some expenditures may be functionally equivalent to contributions in the way they influence the outcome of a race, the way they are interpreted by the candidates and the public, and the way they taint the decisions that the officeholder thereafter takes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Caperton</em> is illuminating in several additional respects.  It underscores the old insight that, on account of the extreme difficulty of proving corruption, \xe2\x80\x9cprophylactic measures, reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in purpose or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard against corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 30; see also <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 392, n.\xc2\xa05.  It underscores that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement\xe2\x80\x9d may likewise be needed to \xe2\x80\x9chedge against circumvention of valid contribution limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also <em>Colorado II</em>, 533 U. S., at 456 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ll Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d).  It underscores that for-profit corporations associated with electioneering communications will often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading names,\xe2\x80\x9d such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, \xe2\x80\x9cto conceal their identity\xe2\x80\x9d as the sponsor of those communications, thereby frustrating the utility of disclosure laws.  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 128; see also <em>id.,</em> at 196\xe2\x80\x93197.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And it underscores that the consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding will not be limited to the legislative or executive context.  The majority of the States select their judges through popular elections.  At a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, see, <em>e.g.,</em> O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov. 15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union general treasury spending in these races.  Perhaps \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Caperton</em> motions\xe2\x80\x9d will catch some of the worst abuses.  This will be small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>Deference and Incumbent Self-Protection</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch of Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorruption rationale without serious analysis.[<a href="#F67" name="T67">Footnote 67</a>]  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion provides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Congress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies have offered one: the incentives of the legislators who passed BCRA.

This possibility, the Court apparently believes, licenses it to run roughshod over Congress\xe2\x80\x99 handiwork.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, we should instead start by acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress surely has both wisdom and experience in these matters that is far superior to ours.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.</em> v. <em>FEC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/604/index.html">518 U. S. 604</a>, 650 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Many of our campaign finance precedents explicitly and forcefully affirm the propriety of such presumptive deference.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 158; <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 155\xe2\x80\x93156; <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U. S., at 209\xe2\x80\x93210.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchanged throughout a century of careful legislative adjustment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U.

In America, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern campaign finance, just like all other laws.  To apply a level of scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating electioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self-interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate\nelectioneering.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if there were a solid basis for believing that a legislative action was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents or that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral process.[<a href="#F68" name="T68">Footnote 68</a>]  See <em>League of United Latin American Citizens</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/399/index.html">548 U.

Along with our duty to balance competing constitutional concerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elections remain at least minimally open, fair, and competitive.  But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress\xe2\x80\x99 years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition.  \xe2\x80\x9cAbsent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 31.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have no record evidence from which to conclude that BCRA \xc2\xa7203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the Court today calls into question, reflects or fosters such invidious discrimination.  Our colleagues have opined that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>any </em>restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 249 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This kind of airy speculation could easily be turned on its head.  The electioneering prohibited by \xc2\xa7203 might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents have pre-existing relationships with corporations and unions, and groups that wish to procure legislative benefits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting officeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits and is statistically likely to retain office.  If a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corporation would do well to cultivate stable, long-term relationships of dependency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we do not have a solid theoretical basis for condemning \xc2\xa7203 as a front for incumbent self-protection, and it seems equally if not more plausible that restrictions on corporate electioneering will be self-denying.  Nor do we have a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cite any empirical research attests.  Nor does the legislative history give reason for concern.  Congress devoted years of careful study to the issues underlying BCRA; \xe2\x80\x9c[f]ew legislative proposals in recent years have received as much sustained public commentary or news coverage\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[p]olitical scientists and academic experts \xe2\x80\xa6 with no self-interest in incumbent protectio[n] were central figures in pressing the case for BCRA\xe2\x80\x9d; and the legislation commanded bipartisan support from the outset.  Pildes, The Supreme Court 2003 Term Foreword: The Constitutionalization of Democratic Politics, 118 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 28, 137 (2004).  Finally, it is important to remember just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were prior to BCRA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  As the Solicitor General aptly remarked at the time, \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence supports overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under the old system just fine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>FEC</em>, O.

S., at 279 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, a legislative judgment that \xe2\x80\x98enough is enough\xe2\x80\x99 should command the greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a constitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect relationship to activity that affects the quantity \xe2\x80\xa6 of repetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 279\xe2\x80\x93280.  The majority cavalierly ignores Congress\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges the validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero.  This is quite different from conscientious policing for impermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensitive First Amendment context.

S., at 659 (quoting <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U.

Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood\xe2\x80\x9d often serves as a useful legal fiction.  But they are not themselves members of \xe2\x80\x9cWe the People\xe2\x80\x9d by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These basic points help explain why corporate electioneering is not only more likely to impair compelling governmental interests, but also why restrictions on that electioneering are less likely to encroach upon First Amendment freedoms.  One fundamental concern of the First Amendment is to \xe2\x80\x9cprotec[t] the individual\xe2\x80\x99s interest in self-expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Public Serv.

Freedom of speech helps \xe2\x80\x9cmake men free to develop their faculties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Whitney</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/index.html">274 U.

Corporate speech, however, is derivative speech, speech by proxy.  A regulation such as BCRA \xc2\xa7203 may affect the way in which individuals disseminate certain messages through the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone from speaking in his or her own voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cWithin the realm of [campaign spending] generally,\xe2\x80\x9d corporate spending is \xe2\x80\x9cfurthest from the core of political expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 161, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is an interesting question \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x9d is even speaking when a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate.  Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in such matters.  It cannot realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political preferences may be opaque to management.  Perhaps the officers or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal ends.  Some individuals associated with the corporation must make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby fostering their self-expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful.  It is entirely possible that the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s electoral message will <em>conflict </em>with their personal convictions.  Take away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of those ads, and no one\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy, dignity, or political equality has been impinged upon in the least.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from individual expenditures in this respect.  I have taken the view that a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on individuals\xe2\x80\x99 electioneering expenditures in the service of the governmental interests explained above, and in recognition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct restraints on speech but rather on its financing.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Randall</em>, 548 U. S., at 273 (dissenting opinion).  But those restrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the primary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is involved.  Some of those individuals might feel that they need to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particular candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral preferences.  This is obviously not the situation with business corporations, as their routine practice of giving \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial sums to <em>both </em>major national parties\xe2\x80\x9d makes pellucidly clear.  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]orporate participation\xe2\x80\x9d in elections, any business executive will tell you, \xe2\x80\x9cis more transactional than ideological.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. Brief for Committee for Economic Development as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this transactional spirit, some corporations have affirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their electioneering communications.  These corporations fear that officeholders will shake them down for supportive ads, that they will have to spend increasing sums on elections in an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors, and that public trust in business will be eroded.  See <em>id.,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9319.  A system that effectively forces corporations to use their shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 money both to maintain access to, and to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ultimately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corporations.  It can impose a kind of implicit tax.[<a href="#F73" name="T73">Footnote 73</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, regulations such as \xc2\xa7203 and the statute upheld in <em>Austin</em> impose only a limited burden on First Amendment freedoms not only because they target a narrow subset of expenditures and leave untouched the broader \xe2\x80\x9cpublic dialogue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 25, but also because they leave untouched the speech of natural persons.  Recognizing the weakness of a speaker-based critique of <em>Austin</em>, the Court places primary emphasis not on the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s right to electioneer, but rather on the listener\xe2\x80\x99s interest in hearing what every possible speaker may have to say.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s central argument is that laws such as \xc2\xa7203 have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deprived [the electorate] of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 38 (quoting <em>CIO</em>, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J., concurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, \xe2\x80\x9cinterferes with the \xe2\x80\x98open marketplace\xe2\x80\x99 of ideas protected by the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 38 (quoting <em>New York State Bd. of Elections</em> v. <em>Lopez Torres</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/196/index.html">552 U. S. 196</a>, 208 (2008)).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are many flaws in this argument.  If the overriding concern depends on the interests of the audience, surely the public\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the value of corporate speech should be given important weight.  That perception today is the same as it was a century ago when Theodore Roosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time, led to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign expenditures that is overruled today.  See <em>WRTL</em>, 551 U. S., at 509\xe2\x80\x93510 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s remarks). The distinctive threat to democratic integrity posed by corporate domination of politics was recognized at \xe2\x80\x9cthe inception of the republic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chas been a persistent theme in American political life\xe2\x80\x9d ever since.  Regan 302.  It is only certain Members of this Court, not the listeners themselves, who have agitated for more corporate electioneering.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Austin </em>recognized that there are substantial reasons why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general treasury expenditures will give corporations \xe2\x80\x9cunfai[r] influence\xe2\x80\x9d in the electoral process, 494 U. S., at 660, and distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the interests of listeners.  The legal structure of corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial resources on a scale few natural persons can match.  The structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s economic interests and the political preferences of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral process with the aim \xe2\x80\x9cto enhance the profitability of the company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a broader or conflicting set of priorities,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11; see also ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations \xc2\xa72.01(a), p.\xc2\xa055 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] corporation \xe2\x80\xa6 should have as its objective the conduct of business activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit and shareholder gain\xe2\x80\x9d).  In a state election such as the one at issue in <em>Austin</em>, the interests of nonresident corporations may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of local voters.  Consequently, when corporations grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can flood the market with advocacy that bears \xe2\x80\x9clittle or no correlation\xe2\x80\x9d to the ideas of natural persons or to any broader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660.  The opinions of real people may be marginalized.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe expenditure restrictions of [2 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa7441b are thus meant to ensure that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 259.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorporate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon thereafter.  Corporate \xe2\x80\x9cdomination\xe2\x80\x9d of electioneering, <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that corporations dominate our democracy.  When citizens turn on their televisions and radios before an election and hear only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy.  A Government captured by corporate interests, they may come to believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor willing to give their views a fair hearing.  The predictable result is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased perception that large spenders \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98call the tune\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and a reduced \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting <em>Shrink Missouri</em>, 528 U. S., at 390).  To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those races may also be chilled.  Politicians who fear that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.  On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneering might diminish the ability of citizens to \xe2\x80\x9chold officials accountable to the people,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 23, and disserve the goal of a public debate that is \xe2\x80\x9cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/index.html">376 U. S. 254</a>, 270 (1964).  At the least, I stress again, a legislature is entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored measures in response.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to distinguish between corporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possibility that corporations\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cwar chests\xe2\x80\x9d and their special \xe2\x80\x9cadvantages\xe2\x80\x9d in the legal realm, <em>Austin,</em> 494 U. S., at 659, may translate into special advantages in the market for legislation.  When large numbers of citizens have a common stake in a measure that is under consideration, it may be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on behalf of their position.  The corporate form, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a simple way to channel rents to only those who have paid their dues, as it were.  If you do not own stock, you do not benefit from the larger dividends or appreciation in the stock price caused by the passage of private interest legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech, Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate Charters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002).  Corporations, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that favor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of money but because of their legal and organizational structure.  Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and the door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is \xe2\x80\x9cfar more destructive\xe2\x80\x9d than what noncorporations are capable of.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It is for reasons such as these that our campaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98differing structures and purposes\xe2\x80\x99 of different entities \xe2\x80\x98may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NRWC</em>, 459 U. S., at 210 (quoting <em>California Medical Assn.</em>, 453 U. S., at 201).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s facile depiction of corporate electioneering assumes away all of these complexities.  Our colleagues ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on \xe2\x80\x9cnothing more\xe2\x80\x9d than a fear that corporations have a special \xe2\x80\x9cability to persuade,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), as if corporations were our society\xe2\x80\x99s ablest debaters and viewpoint-neutral laws such as \xc2\xa7203 were created to suppress their best arguments.  In their haste to knock down yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore the fundamental concerns of the <em>Austin </em>Court and the legislatures that have passed laws like \xc2\xa7203: to safeguard the integrity, competitiveness, and democratic responsiveness of the electoral process.  All of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s theoretical arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experience, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is no such thing as too much speech,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 695 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).[<a href="#F74" name="T74">Footnote 74</a>]  If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority\xe2\x80\x99s premise would be sound.  In the real world, we have seen, corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens\xe2\x80\x99 willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of this is to suggest that corporations can or should be denied an opportunity to participate in election campaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a work of art such as <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington </em>may be banned), or to deny that some corporate speech may contribute significantly to public debate.  What it shows, however, is that <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconcern about corporate domination of the political process,\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 659, reflects more than a concern to protect governmental interests outside of the First Amendment.  It also reflects a concern to<em> facilitate</em> First Amendment values by preserving some breathing room around the electoral \xe2\x80\x9cmarketplace\xe2\x80\x9d of ideas, <em>ante</em>, at 19, 34, 38, 52, 54, the marketplace in which the actual people of this Nation determine how they will govern themselves.  The majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as \xc2\xa7203 do not merely pit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First Amendment values against each other.  There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any effort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers against the First Amendment rights of listeners.  But when the speakers in question are not real people and when the appeal to \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Amendment principles\xe2\x80\x9d depends almost entirely on the listeners\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, <em>ante</em>, at 1, 48, it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actually be affected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In critiquing <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antidistortion rationale and campaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues place tremendous weight on the example of media corporations.  See <em>ante</em>, at 35\xe2\x80\x9338, 46; <em>ante</em>, at 1, 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.); <em>ante</em>, at 6 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Yet it is not at all clear that <em>Austin </em>would permit \xc2\xa7203 to be applied to them.  The press plays a unique role not only in the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but also in facilitating public discourse; as the <em>Austin </em>Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cmedia corporations differ significantly from other corporations in that their resources are devoted to the collection of information and its dissemination to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d 494 U. S., at 667.  Our colleagues have raised some interesting and difficult questions about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and about how to define what constitutes the press.  <em>But that is not the case before us.</em>  Section 203 does not apply to media corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is not a media corporation.  There would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media corporations if the majority did not, first, transform Citizens United\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, second, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all \xe2\x80\x9cidentity\xe2\x80\x9d-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news outlet exactly the same as General Motors.[<a href="#F75" name="T75">Footnote 75</a>]  This calls to mind George Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s description of philosophers: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.\xe2\x80\x9d  Principles of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, \xc2\xb63 (R. Woolhouse ed. 1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues feared that a campaign finance regulation such as \xc2\xa7203 may be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore attended carefully to the choices the Legislature has made.  But the majority does not bother to consider such practical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply stipulates that \xe2\x80\x9cenlightened self-government\xe2\x80\x9d can arise only in the absence of regulation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.  In light of the distinctive features of corporations identified in <em>Austin</em>, there is no valid basis for this assumption.  The marketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items\xe2\x80\x94or laws\xe2\x80\x94are meant to be bought and sold, and when we move from the realm of economics to the realm of corporate electioneering, there may be no \xe2\x80\x9creason to think the market ordering is intrinsically good at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Strauss 1386.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well promote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the Amendment was meant to serve.  It will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process.  Americans may be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-government today.</p>\n<p align="left">2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <em>Shareholder Protection</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is yet another way in which laws such as \xc2\xa7203 can serve First Amendment values.

When corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.

A rule that privileges the use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of dissenters.  <em>Austin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of restrictions on general treasury spending \xe2\x80\x9csimply allows people who have invested in the business corporation for purely economic reasons\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the vast majority of investors, one assumes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their economic objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winkler, Beyond <em>Bellotti</em>, 32 Loyola (LA) L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 133, 201 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and union members has a long history in campaign finance reform.

By \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty.  In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that \xe2\x80\x9cthese rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,\xe2\x80\x9d given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule.

Modern technology may help make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but it is utopian to believe that it solves the problem.  Most American households that own stock do so through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans, see Evans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1105 (2009), which makes it more difficult both to monitor and to alter particular holdings.  Studies show that a majority of individual investors make no trades at all during a given year.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1117.  Moreover, if the corporation in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees the company\xe2\x80\x99s ads may not know whether they are being funded through the PAC or through the general treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been spending general treasury money on objectionable electioneering, they can divest.  Even assuming that they reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only partial.  The injury to the shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 expressive rights has already occurred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation\xe2\x80\x99s stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like.  The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable contributions in ways that any particular shareholder might disapprove.  But those expenditures do not implicate the selection of public officials, an area in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of unwilling \xe2\x80\xa6 corporate shareholders [in not being] forced to subsidize that speech\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9care at their zenith.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 677 (Brennan, J., concurring).  And in any event, the question is whether shareholder protection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in the weeks before an election, not whether additional types of corporate communications might similarly be conditioned on voluntariness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection rationale, the <em>Austin </em>Court did not hold it out as an adequate and independent ground for sustaining the statute in question.  Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the antidistortion rationale, in two main ways.  First, the problem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if electioneering expenditures can advance the political views of some members of a corporation, they will often compromise the views of others.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id., </em>at 663 (discussing risk that corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmembers may be \xe2\x80\xa6 reluctant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with [its] political expression\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, it provides an additional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the corporate form, for doubting that these \xe2\x80\x9cexpenditures reflect actual public support for the political ideas espoused,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 660.  The shareholder protection rationale, in other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on corporate electioneering can serve both speakers\xe2\x80\x99 and listeners\xe2\x80\x99 interests, as well as the anticorruption interest.  And it supplies yet another reason why corporate expenditures merit less protection than individual expenditures.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is backwards in many senses.  It elevates the majority\xe2\x80\x99s agenda over the litigants\xe2\x80\x99 submissions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitutional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over reality.  Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that <em>Austin </em>must be overruled and that \xc2\xa7203 is facially unconstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lawmaking power.  Their conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding corruption and the appearance of corruption does not provide an adequate justification for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate elections relies on an incorrect description of that interest, along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of established facts and the considered judgments of state and federal legislatures over many decades.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of this principle \xe2\x80\x9celevate[s] corporations to a level of deference which has not been seen at least since the days when substantive due process was regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U. S., at 817, n. 13 (White, J., dissenting).  At bottom, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt.  It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense.  While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Specifically, Part I, <em>infra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x9317, addresses the procedural history of the case and the narrower grounds of decision the majority has bypassed.

See <em>ante</em>, at 15.  But that record is not before us in this case.  And in any event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument for striking down \xc2\xa7203 depends on its contention that the statute has proved too \xe2\x80\x9cchilling\xe2\x80\x9d in practice\xe2\x80\x94and in particular on the contention that the controlling opinion in <em>WRTL</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html"></a><a href="/us/551/449/index.html">551 U.

In <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Carhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/124/index.html">550 U.

At times, the majority appears to endorse this extreme view.

If I had a gun I would have gunned you down along with each and every other supporter,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have plans for you and your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d  Complaint in <em>ProtectMarriage.com\xe2\x80\x94Yes on 8</em> v. <em>Bowen</em>,<em> </em>Case<em> </em>No. 2:09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300058\xe2\x80\x93MCE\xe2\x80\x93DAD (ED Cal.), \xc2\xb631.

The director of the nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists complained to his employer.  Lott &amp; Smith, Donor Disclosure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, p. A13.  The director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because opponents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And a woman who had managed her popular, family-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she gave $100, because \xe2\x80\x9cthrongs of [angry] protesters\xe2\x80\x9d repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and \xe2\x80\x9cshout[ed] \xe2\x80\x98shame on you\xe2\x80\x99 at customers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, Los\xc2\xa0Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1.  The police even had to \xe2\x80\x9carriv[e] in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob\xe2\x80\x9d at the restaurant.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Some supporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real estate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a group opposing Proposition 8 \xe2\x80\x9creceived a letter from the Prop. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his company\xe2\x80\x99s name if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t also donate to the \xe2\x80\x98Yes on 8\xe2\x80\x99 campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d  Donor Disclosure, <em>supra,</em> at A13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed donor information to <em>pre-empt</em> citizens\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of their First Amendment rights.  Before the 2008 Presidential election, a \xe2\x80\x9cnewly formed nonprofit group \xe2\x80\xa6 plann[ed] to confront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Luo, Group Plans Campaign Against G.O.P.

Its leader, \xe2\x80\x9cwho described his effort as \xe2\x80\x98going for the jugular,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d detailed the group\xe2\x80\x99s plan to send a \xe2\x80\x9cwarning letter \xe2\x80\xa6 alerting donors who might be considering giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential dangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate why this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements.  But <em>amici</em> present evidence of yet another reason to do so\xe2\x80\x94the threat of retaliation from <em>elected officials</em>.  As <em>amici\xe2\x80\x99</em>s submissions make clear, this threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition in California.  For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent state attorney general reported that some members of the State\xe2\x80\x99s business community feared donating to his campaign because they did not want to cross the incumbent; in his words, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I go to so many people and hear the same thing: \xe2\x80\x9cI sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have my name on your records.  He might come after me next.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism at the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11.  The incumbent won reelection in 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My point is not to express any view on the merits of the political controversies I describe.  Rather, it is to demonstrate\xe2\x80\x94using real-world, recent examples\xe2\x80\x94the fallacy in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements \xe2\x80\xa6 impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 51 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Of course they do.  Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and elected officials to implement political strategies <em>specifically calculated</em> to curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied challenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate those speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can \xe2\x80\x9cshow a reasonable probability that disclosure \xe2\x80\xa6 will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion itself proves the irony in this compromise.  In correctly explaining why it must address the facial constitutionality of \xc2\xa7203, see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9320,<em> </em>the Court recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to \xe2\x80\xa6 seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7; that as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7203 \xe2\x80\x9cwould require substantial litigation over an extended time\xe2\x80\x9d and result in an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310; that \xe2\x80\x9ca court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12; and that avoiding a facial challenge to \xc2\xa7203 \xe2\x80\x9cwould prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa7203 causes, <em>ante</em>, at 16.  This logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied challenges to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Irony aside, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s promise that as-applied challenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assurance.  Now more than ever, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201 and 311 will chill protected speech because\xe2\x80\x94as California voters can attest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe advent of the Internet\xe2\x80\x9d enables \xe2\x80\x9cprompt  disclosure of expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s]\xe2\x80\x9d political opponents \xe2\x80\x9cwith the information needed\xe2\x80\x9d to intimidate and retaliate against their foes.  <em>Ante</em>, at 55.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure permits citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 to react to the speech of [their political opponents] in a proper\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or undeniably <em>improper</em>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cway\xe2\x80\x9d long before a plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment that subjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined careers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and threatening warning letters as the price for engaging in \xe2\x80\x9ccore political speech, the \xe2\x80\x98primary object of First Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U.
