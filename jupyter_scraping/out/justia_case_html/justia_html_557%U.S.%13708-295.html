BAILEY et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 30, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 18, 2009<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p align="left">As part of the 1986 reorganization plan of the Johns-Manville Corporation (Manville), an asbestos supplier and manufacturer of asbestos-containing products, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement providing that Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurers, including The Travelers Indemnity Company and related companies (Travelers), would contribute to the corpus of the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Trust), and releasing those insurers from any \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims,\xe2\x80\x9d which were channeled to the Trust.  \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d include, as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d against the insurers \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon, arising out of or relating to\xe2\x80\x9d the Manville insurance policies.  The settlement agreement and reorganization plan were approved by the Bankruptcy Court (1986 Orders) and were affirmed by the District Court and the Second Circuit.  Over a decade later plaintiffs began filing asbestos actions against Travelers in state courts (Direct Actions), often seeking to recover from Travelers not for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing but for Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 own alleged violations of state consumer-protection statutes or of common law duties.  Invoking the 1986 Orders, Travelers asked the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Actions.  Ultimately, a settlement was reached, in which Travelers agreed to make payments to compensate the Direct Action claimants, contingent on the court\xe2\x80\x99s order clarifying that the Direct Actions were, and remained, prohibited by the 1986 Orders.  The court made extensive factual findings, uncontested here, concluding that Travelers derived its knowledge of asbestos from its insurance relationship with Manville and that the Direct Actions are based on acts or omissions by Travelers arising from or related to the insurance policies.  It then approved the settlement and entered an order (Clarifying Order), which provided that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct Actions and various other claims.  Objectors to the settlement (respondents here) appealed.  The District Court affirmed, but the Second Circuit reversed.  Agreeing that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the 1986 Orders, the Circuit nevertheless held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Direct Actions because those actions sought not to recover based on Manville\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, but to recover directly from Travelers for its own conduct.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The terms of the injunction bar the Direct Actions against Travelers, and the finality of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1986 Orders generally stands in the way of challenging their enforceability.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Direct Actions are \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d enjoined as against Travelers by the 1986 Orders, which covered, <em>inter alia, </em>\xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crelating to\xe2\x80\x9d Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance coverage of Manville.  In a statute, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he phrase \xe2\x80\x98in relation to\xe2\x80\x99 is expansive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 237, and so is its reach here.  While it would be possible to suggest that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d only relates to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance coverage if it seeks recovery based upon Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 specific contractual obligation to Manville, \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d is not amenable to such a narrow construction and clearly reaches factual assertions that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 dealings with Manville.  The Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed factual findings place the Direct Actions within the terms of the 1986 Orders.  Contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument, the 1986 Orders contain no language limiting \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d to claims derivative of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s liability.  Even if, before the entry of the 1986 Orders, Travelers understood the proposed injunction to bar only such derivative claims, where a court order\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms unambiguously apply, as they do here, they are entitled to their effect.  If it is black-letter law that an unambiguous private contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms must be enforced irrespective of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 subjective intent, it is also clear that a court, such as the Bankruptcy Court here, should enforce a court order, a public governmental act, according to its unambiguous terms.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because the 1986 Orders became final on direct review over two decades ago, whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction and authority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not properly before the Second Circuit in 2008 and is not properly before this Court.  The Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior orders, see <em>Local Loan Co.</em> v. <em>Hunt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/234/index.html">292 U. S. 234</a>, 239, and it explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce its injunctions when it issued the 1986 Orders.  The Second Circuit erred in holding the 1986 Orders unenforceable according to their terms on the ground that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in 1986.  On direct appeal of the 1986 Orders, any objector was free to argue that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and the District Court or Court of Appeals could have raised such concerns <em>sua sponte</em>.  But once those orders became final on direct review, they became res judicata to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98parties and those in privity with them.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/110/index.html">463 U. S. 110</a>, 130.  So long as respondents or those in privity with them were parties to Manville\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy proceeding, and were given a fair chance to challenge the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction, they cannot challenge it now by resisting enforcement of the 1986 Orders.  The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to entertain this collateral attack cannot be squared with res judicata and the practical necessity served by that rule.  Almost a quarter-century after the 1986 Orders were entered, the time to prune them is over.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This holding in narrow.  The Court neither resolves whether a bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing, nor decides whether any particular respondent is bound by the 1986 Orders, which is a question that the Second Circuit did not consider.

The question is whether the injunction bars state-law actions against Travelers based on allegations either of its own wrongdoing while acting as Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurer or of its misuse of information obtained from Manville as its insurer.  We hold that the terms of the injunction bar the actions and that the finality of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders following the conclusion of direct review generally stands in the way of challenging the enforceability of the injunction.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the 1920s to the 1970s, Manville was, by most accounts, the largest supplier of raw asbestos and manufacturer of asbestos-containing products in the United States, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 517 F.\xc2\xa03d 52, 55\xe2\x80\x9356 (CA2 2008), and for much of that time Travelers was Manville\xe2\x80\x99s primary liability insurer.  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, No. 82 B 11656 etc. (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, pp. 111a\xe2\x80\x93112a (hereinafter Bkrtcy. Ct. Op.).  As studies began to link asbestos exposure to respiratory disease and thousands of lawsuits were filed against Manville, Travelers, as the insurer, worked closely with Manville to learn what its insured knew and to assess the dangers of asbestos exposure; it evaluated Manville\xe2\x80\x99s potential liability and defenses, and paid Manville\xe2\x80\x99s litigation costs.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114a\xe2\x80\x93117a, 121a\xe2\x80\x93122a.  In 1982, the prospect of overwhelming liability led Manville to file for bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It thus became incumbent on the Bankruptcy Court to devise \xe2\x80\x9ca plan of reorganization for [Manville] which would provide for payment to holders of present or known asbestos health related claims \xe2\x80\xa6 and [to] those persons who had not yet manifested an injury but who would manifest symptoms of asbestos-related illnesses at some future time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 97 B.\xc2\xa0R. 174, 176 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1989).  The ensuing reorganization plan created the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Trust) to pay all asbestos claims against Manville, which would be channeled to the Trust.  See <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 843 F.\xc2\xa02d 636, 640\xe2\x80\x93641 (CA2 1988);<em> In re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 340 B.\xc2\xa0R. 49, 54 (SDNY 2006).  The Trust has since paid out more than $3.2 billion to over 600,000 claimants.  Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 136a\xe2\x80\x93137a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the period leading up to the reorganization, Manville and its insurers litigated over the scope and limits of liability coverage, and Travelers faced suits by third parties, such as Manville factory workers and vendors of Manville products, seeking compensation under the insurance policies.  There was also litigation among the insurers themselves, who brought various indemnity claims, contribution claims, and cross-claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 132a\xe2\x80\x93134a.  In a settlement described as the \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstone\xe2\x80\x9d of the Manville reorganization, the insurers agreed to provide most of the initial corpus of the Trust, with a payment of $770 million to the bankruptcy estate, $80 million of it from Travelers.  <em>MacArthur Co. </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp</em>., 837 F.\xc2\xa02d 89, 90 (CA2 1988); Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 134a; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 68 B.\xc2\xa0R. 618, 621 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There would have been no such payment without the injunction at the heart of the present dispute.  The December 18, 1986, order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the insurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settlement Order) provides that, upon the insurers\xe2\x80\x99 payment of the settlement funds to the Trust, \xe2\x80\x9call Persons are permanently restrained and enjoined from commencing and/or continuing any suit, arbitration or other proceeding of any type or nature for Policy Claims against any or all members of the Settling Insurer Group.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, at 446a.  The Insurance Settlement Order goes on to provide that the insurers are \xe2\x80\x9creleased from any and all Policy Claims,\xe2\x80\x9d which are to be channeled to the Trust.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The order defines \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany and all claims, demands, allegations, duties, liabilities and obligations (whether or not presently known) which have been, or could have been, or might be, asserted by any Person against \xe2\x80\xa6 any or all members of the Settling Insurer Group based upon, arising out of or relating to any or all of the Policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 439a.  The insurers were entitled \xe2\x80\x9cto terminate the settlements if the injunctive orders [were] not issued or if they [were] set aside on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MacArthur</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 90.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Insurance Settlement Order was incorporated by reference in the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s December 22, 1986, order confirming Manville\xe2\x80\x99s Second Amended and Restated Plan of Reorganization (Confirmation Order).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, at 271a\xe2\x80\x93272a.  Both the Confirmation Order and the Insurance Settlement Order (collectively, 1986 Orders) were affirmed by the District Court, see <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 78 B.\xc2\xa0R. 407 (SDNY 1987), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see <em>MacArthur</em>, <em>supra;</em> <em>Kane</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, over a decade later plaintiffs started filing asbestos actions against Travelers in various state courts, cases that have been spoken of in this litigation as Direct Actions.  They are of two sorts.  The Statutory Direct Actions are brought under state consumer-protection statutes, and allege that Travelers conspired with other insurers and with asbestos manufacturers to hide the dangers of asbestos and to raise a fraudulent \xe2\x80\x9cstate of the art\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cno duty to warn\xe2\x80\x9d) defense to personal injury claims.  Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 140a\xe2\x80\x93143a.  The Common Law Direct Actions claim that Travelers violated common law duties by failing to warn the public about the dangers of asbestos or by acting to keep its knowledge of those dangers from the public.  <em>Id.</em>, at 143a\xe2\x80\x93147a.  It is undisputed that many of the plaintiffs seek to recover from Travelers, not indirectly for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing, but for Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 own alleged violations of state law.  See 517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 63.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, Travelers invoked the terms of the 1986 Orders in moving the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Actions pending in state courts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 58.  The court issued a temporary restraining order, repeatedly extended, and referred the parties to mediation, which led to settlements between Travelers and three sets of plaintiffs in both Statutory and Common Law Direct Actions.  Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 103a\xe2\x80\x93104a.  Under the settlement terms Travelers would pay more than $400 million to settlement funds to compensate Direct Action claimants, contingent upon the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court clarifying that the Direct Actions were, and remained, prohibited by the 1986 Orders.  <em>Id.</em>, at 150a\xe2\x80\x93152a.  The settlement requires claimants seeking payment from the settlement funds to grant Travelers a release from further liability, separate and apart from Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 protection under the 1986 Orders.  <em>Id.</em>, at 151a\xe2\x80\x93152a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After notice of the settlement was given to potential claimants, the Bankruptcy Court (the same judge who had issued the 1986 Orders) held an evidentiary hearing and made extensive factual findings that are not challenged here.  The court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cTravelers[\xe2\x80\x99] knowledge of the hazards of asbestos was derived from its nearly three decade insurance relationship with Manville and the performance by Travelers of its obligations under the Policies, including through the underwriting, loss control activities, defense obligations and generally through its lengthy and confidential insurance relationship under the policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 128a\xe2\x80\x93129a.  In sum, the Bankruptcy Court found that \xe2\x80\x9cTravelers learned virtually everything it knew about asbestos from its relationship with Manville.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 131a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Direct Actions, the court saw \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he gravamen of the Statutory Direct Action Lawsuits\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ccenter[ing] on Travelers[\xe2\x80\x99] defense of Manville in asbestos-related claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at<em> </em>142a.  The court read the \xe2\x80\x9calleged factual predicate\xe2\x80\x9d of the Common Law Direct Actions as being \xe2\x80\x9cessentially identical to the statutory actions: Travelers \xe2\x80\xa6 influence[d] Manville\xe2\x80\x99s purported failure to disclose knowledge about asbestos hazards; Travelers defended Manville; Travelers advanced the state of the art defense; and Travelers coordinated Manville\xe2\x80\x99s national defense effort.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 147a (citations omitted).  The court understood \xe2\x80\x9cthe direct action claims against Travelers [to be] inextricably intertwined with Travelers[\xe2\x80\x99] long relationship as Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 169a, and found that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]fter the Court preliminarily enjoined prosecution of Direct Action Claims against Travelers pending final ruling on the merits, certain plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers violated the letter and the spirit of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings by simply deleting the term \xe2\x80\x98Manville\xe2\x80\x99 from their complaints\xe2\x80\x94but leaving the substance unchanged,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 147a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hence, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he evidence in this proceeding establishes that the gravamen of Direct Action Claims were acts or omissions by Travelers arising from or relating to Travelers[\xe2\x80\x99] insurance relationship with Manville.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 173a.  Finding that the \xe2\x80\x9cclaims against Travelers based on such actions or omissions necessarily \xe2\x80\x98arise out of\xe2\x80\x99 and [are] \xe2\x80\x98related to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the insurance policies, <em>ibid</em>., which compelled Travelers to defend Manville against asbestos-related claims, <em>id.</em>, at 173a\xe2\x80\x93176a, the Bankruptcy Court held that the Direct Actions \xe2\x80\x9care\xe2\x80\x94and always have been\xe2\x80\x94permanently barred\xe2\x80\x9d by the 1986 Orders, <em>id.</em>, at 170a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The settlement was accordingly approved and an order dated August 17, 2004 (Clarifying Order), was entered, providing that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct Actions and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he commencement or prosecution of all actions and proceedings against Travelers that directly or indirectly are based upon, arise out of or relate to Travelers[\xe2\x80\x99] insurance relationship with Manville or Travelers[\xe2\x80\x99] knowledge or alleged knowledge concerning the hazards of asbestos,\xe2\x80\x9d including claims for contribution or indemnification.  <em>Id.</em>, at 95a.  The Clarifying Order does not, however, block \xe2\x80\x9cthe commencement and prosecution of claims against Travelers by policyholders other than Manville . . . for insurance proceeds or other obligations arising under any policy of insurance provided by Travelers to a policyholder other than Manville.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 96a.

In presenting the case to the Second Circuit the objectors argued that the Direct Actions fall outside the scope of the 1986 Orders and that the Clarifying Order erroneously expands those orders to bar actions beyond the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction and statutory authority.  Travelers and the settling claimants responded that the Clarifying Order is consistent with the terms of the 1986 Orders, that this reading of the 1986 Orders does not generate any jurisdictional or other statutory concerns, and that the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s prior rejection of a challenge to the Insurance Settlement Order in <em>MacArthur</em>,<em> </em>837 F.\xc2\xa02d 89, is controlling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its opinion explaining the judgment under review here, the Second Circuit recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is undisputed that the bankruptcy court had continuing jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own 1986 orders,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no doubt that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to clarify its prior orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  It also had \xe2\x80\x9clittle doubt that, in a literal sense, the instant claims against Travelers \xe2\x80\x98arise out of\xe2\x80\x99 its provision of insurance coverage to Manville,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 67, and the court emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s extensive factual findings regarding Manville\xe2\x80\x99s all-encompassing presence in the asbestos industry and its extensive relationship with Travelers support this notion\xe2\x80\x9d that the subjects of the Clarifying Order fall within the scope of the 1986 Orders, <em>ibid</em>.  The Circuit nevertheless held that the Bankruptcy Court could not, in enforcing the 1986 Orders, \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin claims over which it had no jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 61, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ancillary jurisdiction courts possess to enforce their own orders is itself limited by the jurisdictional limits of the order sought to be enforced,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 65, n. 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also <em>id.</em>, at 65 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that our case involves a clarification of the bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s prior order does not alter the jurisdictional predicate necessary to enjoin third-party non-debtor claims\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdictional analysis by the lower courts falls short,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 62, in failing to recognize the significance of the fact that the Direct Actions \xe2\x80\x9cdo not seek to collect on the basis of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cseek to recover directly from Travelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 63.  The Court of Appeals held that the Bankruptcy Court mistook its jurisdiction when it enjoined \xe2\x80\x9cclaims brought against a third-party non-debtor solely on the basis of that third-party\xe2\x80\x99s financial contribution to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estate,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ca bankruptcy court only has jurisdiction to enjoin third-party non-debtor claims that directly affect the <em>res </em>of the bankruptcy estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 66.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching this result, the court explained that its prior decision in <em>MacArthur </em>was not controlling, as there a Manville asbestos distributor had challenged the authority of the Bankruptcy Court to bar it from collecting out of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s own insurance coverage.  517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 62.  Here, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cTravelers candidly admits that both the statutory and common law claims seek damages from Travelers that are <em>unrelated</em> to the policy proceeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 63.  The Court of Appeals also considered the 1994 enactment of 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7524(g), which provides explicit statutory authority for a bankruptcy court to order the channeling of claims against a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s insurers to the bankruptcy estate, but the court understood \xc2\xa7524(g) to be \xe2\x80\x9climited to situations where a third party has derivative liability for the claims against the debtor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwas not intended to reach non-derivative claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 68 (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U.

The Court of Appeals, however, believed it was free to look beyond the terms of the 1986 Orders and so treated the action as one \xe2\x80\x9cconcern[ing] the outer reaches of a bankruptcy court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 55.  This, we think, was error.  If this were a direct review of the 1986 Orders, the Court of Appeals would indeed have been duty bound to consider whether the Bankruptcy Court had acted beyond its subject-matter jurisdiction.  See <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 514 (2006); <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/379/index.html">111 U. S. 379</a>, 382 (1884).  But the 1986 Orders became final on direct review over two decades ago, and Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 response to the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional ruling is correct: whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction and authority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not properly before the Court of Appeals in 2008 and is not properly before us.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin at our point of agreement with the Second Circuit, that the Direct Actions are \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d enjoined as against Travelers by the language of the 1986 Orders, which covered \xe2\x80\x9cclaims, demands, allegations, duties, liabilities and obligations\xe2\x80\x9d against Travelers, known or unknown at the time, \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon, arising out of or relating to\xe2\x80\x9d Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance coverage of Manville.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, at 439a.  In a statute, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he phrase \xe2\x80\x98in relation to\xe2\x80\x99 is expansive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 237 (1993), and so is its reach here, where \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d covers not only \xe2\x80\x9cclaims,\xe2\x80\x9d but even \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d relating to the insurance coverage.  Although it would be possible (albeit quite a stretch) to suggest that a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d only relates to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance coverage if it seeks recovery based upon Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 specific contractual obligation to Manville, \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d is not even remotely amenable to such a narrow construction and clearly reaches factual assertions that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 dealings with Manville.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s uncontested factual findings drive the point home.  In substance, the Bankruptcy Court found that the Direct Actions seek to recover against Travelers either for supposed wrongdoing in its capacity as Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurer or for improper use of information that Travelers obtained from Manville as its insurer.  These actions so clearly involve \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d (and, all the more so, \xe2\x80\x9callegations\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon, arising out of or relating to\xe2\x80\x9d Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance coverage of Manville, that we have no need here to stake out the ultimate bounds of the injunction.  There is, of course, a cutoff at some point, where the connection between the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s action complained of and the insurance coverage would be thin to the point of absurd.  See <em>California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement</em> v. <em>Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/316/index.html">519 U. S. 316</a>, 335 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]pplying the \xe2\x80\x98relate to\xe2\x80\x99 provision according to its terms was a project doomed to failure, since, as many a curbstone philosopher has observed, everything is related to everything else\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans</em> v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/645/index.html">514 U. S. 645</a>, 655 (1995).  But the detailed findings of the Bankruptcy Court place the Direct Actions within the terms of the 1986 Orders without pushing the limits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that this is just revisionism perpetrated by the Clarifying Order, which they say improperly expanded the scope of the 1986 Orders to enjoin the Direct Actions.  Their position appears to be that the 1986 Orders only bar actions against insurers seeking to recover derivatively for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing, but not actions to recover for Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 own misconduct, no matter what its relationship to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 coverage of Manville.  But this simply is not what the 1986 Orders say.  The definition of \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d contains nothing limiting it to derivative actions, and there is language in the 1986 Orders directly to the contrary: The 1986 Orders not only enjoin bringing expansively defined \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d against the settling insurers, but they go on to provide that the injunction has no application to a claim previously brought against a settling insurer \xe2\x80\x9cseeking any and all damages (other than or in addition to policy proceeds) for bad faith or other insurer misconduct alleged in connection with the handling or disposition of claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, at 446a.  There is no doubt about the implication, that this same sort of claim brought after the 1986 Orders become final will be barred.  There would have been no need for this exception if \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d were limited to claims against Travelers for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents seek further refuge in evidence that before entry of the 1986 Orders some parties to the Manville bankruptcy (including Travelers) understood the proposed injunction to bar only claims derivative of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s liability.  They may well be right about that: we are in no position to engage in factfinding on this point, but there certainly are statements in the record that seem to support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention.  See App. for Respondent Chubb 1a\xe2\x80\x933a, 5a, 13a\xe2\x80\x9314a.  But be that as it may, where the plain terms of a court order unambiguously apply, as they do here, they are entitled to their effect.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Negr\xc3\xb3n-Almeda</em> v. <em>Santiago</em>, 528 F.\xc2\xa03d 15, 23 (CA1 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] court must carry out and enforce an order that is clear and unambiguous on its face\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spallone</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 421 (CA2 2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a judgment is clear and unambiguous, a court must adopt, and give effect to, the plain meaning of the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  If it is black-letter law that the terms of an unambiguous private contract must be enforced irrespective of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 subjective intent, see 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa730:4 (4th ed. 1999), it is all the clearer that a court should enforce a court order, a public governmental act, according to its unambiguous terms.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  This is all the Bankruptcy Court did.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the Clarifying Order\xe2\x80\x99s correct reading of the 1986 Orders, the only question left is whether the Bankruptcy Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the Clarifying Order.  The answer here is easy: as the Second Circuit recognized, and respondents do not dispute, the Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.  See <em>Local Loan Co.</em> v. <em>Hunt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/292/234/index.html">292 U. S. 234</a>, 239 (1934).  What is more, when the Bankruptcy Court issued the 1986 Orders it explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce its injunctions.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93295, at 284a\xe2\x80\x93286a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals, however, went on to a different jurisdictional enquiry.  It held that the 1986 Orders could not be enforced according to their terms because, as the panel saw it, the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction when it issued the orders in 1986.  We think, though, that it was error for the Court of Appeals to reevaluate the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction in 1986.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On direct appeal of the 1986 Orders, anyone who objected was free to argue that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and the District Court or Court of Appeals could have raised such concerns <em>sua sponte</em>.  In fact, one objector argued just that.  In <em>MacArthur</em>, a distributor of Manville asbestos claimed to be a coinsured under certain Manville insurance policies and argued that the 1986 Orders exceeded the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction by preventing the distributor from recovering under the policies; the Second Circuit disagreed, concluding that the Bankruptcy Court had not stepped outside its jurisdiction or statutory authority.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See 837 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 91\xe2\x80\x9394.  But once the 1986 Orders became final on direct review (whether or not proper exercises of bankruptcy court jurisdiction and power), they became res judicata to the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/110/index.html">463 U.

S. 351</a>, 352 (1877)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those orders are not any the less preclusive because the attack is on the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s conformity with its subject-matter jurisdiction, for \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven subject-matter jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 may not be attacked collaterally.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/443/index.html">540 U.

Their determinations of such questions, while open to direct review, may not be assailed collaterally\xe2\x80\x9d).  So long as respondents or those in privity with them were parties to the Manville bankruptcy proceeding, and were given a fair chance to challenge the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction, they cannot challenge it now by resisting enforcement of the 1986 Orders.

We do not resolve whether a bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing.  As the Court of Appeals noted, in 1994 Congress explicitly authorized bankruptcy courts, in some circumstances, to enjoin actions against a nondebtor \xe2\x80\x9calleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on the debtor to the extent such alleged liability \xe2\x80\xa6 arises by reason of \xe2\x80\xa6 the third party\xe2\x80\x99s provision of insurance to the debtor or a related party,\xe2\x80\x9d and to channel those claims to a trust for payments to asbestos claimants.  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7524 (g)(4)(A)(ii).  On direct review today, a channeling injunction of the sort issued by the Bankruptcy Court in 1986 would have to be measured against the requirements of \xc2\xa7524 (to begin with, at least).  But owing to the posture of this litigation, we do not address the scope of an injunction authorized by that section.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do we decide whether any particular respondent is bound by the 1986 Orders.

See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Shenango Group Inc.</em>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 338, 346 (CA3 2007); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Dow Corning Corp.</em>, 456 F.\xc2\xa03d 668, 675 (CA6 2006); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Optical Technologies</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, 425 F.\xc2\xa03d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Dial Business Forms, Inc.</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 738, 744 (CA8 2003); <em>In\xc2\xa0re National Gypsum Co.</em>, 219 F.\xc2\xa03d 478, 484 (CA5 2000); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Casse</em>, 198 F.\xc2\xa03d 327, 333 (CA2 1999); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Tomlin</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa03d 933, 941 (CA4 1997); <em>Monarch Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ropes &amp; Gray</em>, 65 F.\xc2\xa03d 973, 983 (CA1 1995); <em>In re Weber</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa03d 413, 416 (CA7 1994).  Because the 1986 Orders clearly cover the Direct Actions, we need not determine the proper standard of review.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We agree with the Court of Appeals that <em>MacArthur </em>only resolved the narrow question whether the Bankruptcy Court could enjoin derivative claims against the insurers and did not address whether the 1986 Orders, in their entirety, were proper.  We note <em>MacArthur </em>merely to illustrate the obvious: the 1986 Orders were subject to challenge, on jurisdictional grounds or otherwise, on direct review.  The dissent suggests that <em>MacArthur </em>limited the scope of the 1986 Orders to derivative claims, see <em>post</em>, at 1, 7\xe2\x80\x939, but it did not.  The question whether the Bankruptcy Court had enjoined or could properly enjoin nonderivative claims was not at issue in <em>MacArthur</em> and the court did not answer it.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The rule is not absolute, and we have recognized rare situations in which subject-matter jurisdiction is subject to collateral attack.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/309/506/index.html">309 U. S. 506</a>, 514 (1940) (a collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction is permissible \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the issue is the waiver of [sovereign] immunity\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kalb</em> v. <em>Feuerstein</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/433/index.html">308 U. S. 433</a>, 439\xe2\x80\x93440, 444 (1940) (where debtor\xe2\x80\x99s petition for relief was pending in bankruptcy court and federal statute affirmatively divested other courts of jurisdiction to continue foreclosure proceedings, state-court foreclosure judgment was subject to collateral attack).  More broadly, the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa712, p. 115 (1980), describes three exceptional circumstances in which a collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction is permitted:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1) The subject matter of the action was so plainly beyond the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction that its entertaining the action was a manifest abuse of authority; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2) Allowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the authority of another tribunal or agency of government; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(3) The judgment was rendered by a court lacking capability to make an adequately informed determination of a question concerning its own jurisdiction and as a matter of procedural fairness the party seeking to avoid the judgment should have opportunity belatedly to attack the court\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\nThis is no occasion to address whether we adopt all of these exceptions.  Respondents do not claim any of them, and we do not see how any would apply here.  This is not a situation, for example, in which a bankruptcy court decided to conduct a criminal trial, or to resolve a custody dispute, matters \xe2\x80\x9cso plainly beyond the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d that a different result might be called for.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Respondents point out that it is Travelers, not they, who moved the Bankruptcy Court to enforce the 1986 Orders.  But who began the present proceedings has no bearing on the application of res judicata; to the extent respondents argue that the 1986 Orders should not be enforced according to their terms because of a jurisdictional flaw in 1986, this argument is an impermissible collateral attack.  And to the extent respondents disclaim any initial intent to mount such an attack, this too is irrelevant, since the decision of the Court of Appeals is what we review and find at odds with finality.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 524(h) provides that under some circumstances \xc2\xa7524(g) operates retroactively to validate an injunction.

I disagree.  In my view, the injunction bars only those claims against Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurers seeking to recover from the bankruptcy estate for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, not those claims seeking to recover against the insurers for their own misconduct.  This interpretation respects the limits of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s power; it is consistent with the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 understanding when it upheld the 1986 injunction on direct review and with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 codification of the Manville bankruptcy approach for future asbestos proceedings in 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7524(g); and it makes sense of Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 payment of $445 million in 2004 in exchange for a Bankruptcy Court order that supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cclarified\xe2\x80\x9d an unambiguous injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the 1986 injunction has never meant what the Court today assumes, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is not an impermissible collateral attack.  The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 order improperly enjoined the state-law claims at issue in this proceeding.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the heart of the dispute in this litigation is the distinction between two types of lawsuits seeking recovery from Manville\xe2\x80\x99s primary insurer, The Travelers Indemnity Company, and its affiliates (together, Travelers).  The first class, which I shall call \xe2\x80\x9cinsurer actions,\xe2\x80\x9d comprises suits in which the plaintiff is asserting that Travelers, as an insurer of Manville, has a duty to satisfy the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim against Manville.  Plaintiffs in that class include not only members of the public exposed to asbestos but also Manville factory workers and vendors of Manville products.  The second class, which I shall call \xe2\x80\x9cindependent actions,\xe2\x80\x9d comprises suits in which the plaintiff is asserting that Travelers is liable for its own misconduct.  The plaintiffs in these suits have alleged both violations of state consumer-protection laws and breaches of common-law duties.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Suits that are called \xe2\x80\x9cdirect actions\xe2\x80\x9d in the proceedings below and in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion may fall in either category, but as the Court acknowledges the \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d definition of that term describes only insurer actions.  <em>Ante, </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935, n.\xc2\xa02; see Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 491 (8th ed. 2004).   True direct actions are lawsuits in which a plaintiff claims that she was injured by Manville and seeks recovery directly from its insurer without first obtaining a judgment against Manville.  The global settlement that made the 1986 reorganization of Manville possible clearly encompassed all such direct actions; Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurers paid $770 million, including $80 million from Travelers, into the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Manville Trust) to which these actions would be channeled.  But many of the claims that gave rise to the instant litigation allege no breach of duty by Manville and seek no recovery from the Manville Trust.  See <em>ante, </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935, n.\xc2\xa02.  They are claims against Travelers based on its own alleged violations of state statutes and common-law rules.  Thus, even though the Court calls these claims \xe2\x80\x9cdirect actions,\xe2\x80\x9d they are nothing of the sort.  They are independent actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some of the independent actions are based on facts concerning Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance relationship with Manville.   A number of suits, for example, allege that Travelers acquired information about asbestos-related hazards from Manville that it had a duty to disclose to third parties.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  This sort of factual nexus does not, however, transform an independent action into an insurer action.  Instead, the question remains whether a suit seeks to recover from Travelers for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing or instead seeks to recover from Travelers for its own wrongdoing, making no claim on Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policy proceeds or other assets of the Manville bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the distinction between insurer actions and independent actions, the Court of Appeals held that the Bankruptcy Court had improperly enjoined the latter in its 2004 order.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Without ruling on the extent of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s power, see <em>ante</em>, at 17, the Court today concludes that the 1986 injunction unambiguously barred independent actions and that the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 order simply clarified, and did not enlarge, the scope of that injunction.  Based on that premise, the Court holds that respondents are challenging the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to have issued the injunction in 1986, and it deems the challenge an impermissible collateral attack.  I disagree with both the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the 1986 injunction and its attendant res judicata analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1986 order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the insurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settlement Order), which was incorporated by reference in the order confirming Manville\xe2\x80\x99s plan of reorganization, includes three related protections for Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurers, each focused on the company\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policies.  It releases the insurers from all \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims,\xe2\x80\x9d channels these claims to the Manville Trust, and permanently enjoins all persons from commencing or continuing a proceeding for \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d against a settling insurer.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 445a\xe2\x80\x93446a.  The Insurance Settlement Order defines \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d as:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cany and all claims, demands, allegations, duties, liabilities and obligations (whether or not presently known) which have been, or could have been, or might be, asserted by any Person against any or all members of the [Manville] Group or against any or all members of the Settling Insurer Group <em>based upon, arising out of or relating to any or all of the Policies</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 439a (emphasis added).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nFocusing on the italicized phrase, and particularly the term \xe2\x80\x9crelating to,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court declares that this language \xe2\x80\x9cis not even remotely amenable\xe2\x80\x9d to a construction that excludes independent actions and \xe2\x80\x9cclearly reaches factual assertions that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 dealings with Manville.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Thus, it concludes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plain terms of [the] court order unambiguously\xe2\x80\x9d bar independent actions.  <em>Ante, </em>at 12.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court doth protest too much.  Indeed, despite its insistence that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d is unambiguous, the Court quickly concludes that it cannot apply the \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon, arising out of or relating to\xe2\x80\x9d language literally because there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccutoff at some point, where the connection between the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s action complained of and the insurance coverage would be thin to the point of absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 11.  Presumably, for instance, the Court would not deem enjoined a state-law claim for personal injuries caused by a Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 agent\xe2\x80\x99s reckless driving while en route to the courthouse to defend Manville even though, in a literal sense, this suit relates to (perhaps even arises out of) Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 performance of its policy obligations to Manville.  The Court determines that it need not \xe2\x80\x9cstake out the ultimate bounds of the injunction\xe2\x80\x9d because it can rely on the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cuncontested factual findings\xe2\x80\x9d that the particular independent actions at issue fall within the category that it had intended to enjoin.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d is not amenable to a purely literal construction and the Court must look beyond the four corners of the Insurance Settlement Order to ascertain its meaning, however, the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings in 2004 are not the best guide.  I would instead construe the order with reference to the limits of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority\xe2\x80\x94limits that were well understood by the insurers during the original settlement negotiations\xe2\x80\x94and with reference to<font b="1"> the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the Insurance Settlement Order when it upheld it against a jurisdictional challenge in 1988.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We should not lightly assume that the Bankruptcy Court entered an order that exceeded its authority.  When a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced, the bankruptcy court acquires control of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s assets and the power to discharge its debts.  A bankruptcy court has no authority, however, to adjudicate, settle, or enjoin claims against nondebtors that do not affect the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estate.  Because Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance policies were a significant asset of the Manville bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy Court had the power to channel claims to the insurance proceeds to the Manville Trust.  But this by no means gave it the power to enjoin claims against nondebtors like Travelers that had no impact on the bankruptcy estate.  Thus, even accepting the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s representation in 2004 that it had \xe2\x80\x9cmeant to provide the broadest protection possible\xe2\x80\x9d to the settling insurers, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a, such relief could not include protection from independent actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the Bankruptcy Court was without authority to enjoin independent actions was well understood by both Manville and Travelers during their settlement negotiations.  In Manville\xe2\x80\x99s memorandum in support of the Insurance Settlement Agreement, it clarified that it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot seek to have [the Bankruptcy] Court release its Settling Insurers from claims by third parties based on the Insurer\xe2\x80\x99s own tortious misconduct towards the third party\xe2\x80\x9d but rather sought only to release the insurers \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the rights Manville might itself have against them or rights derivative of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s rights under the policies being compromised and settled.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. for Respondent Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co. 5a.  This understanding reflected not only the basic fact that the settlement was between Manville and its insurers (and not third parties), but also the parties\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge that the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Circuit [had held] that the bankruptcy courts lack power to discharge \xe2\x80\x98independent\xe2\x80\x99 claims of third parties against nondebtors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 5a\xe2\x80\x936a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Travelers similarly acknowledged the limits of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s power.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court has <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the Policies and thus the power to enter appropriate orders to protect that jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d it stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe injunction is intended only to restrain claims against the res<em> </em>(<em>i.e.</em>, the Policies) which are or may be asserted, against the Settling Insurers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13a\xe2\x80\x9314a;[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] see also <em>id.</em>, at 10a (memorandum of the legal representative of the Bankruptcy Court noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll parties seem to agree that any injunction, channeling order and release is limited to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over the <em>res</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, it was apparent to the settling parties, and no doubt also to the Bankruptcy Court, that the court lacked the power to enjoin third-party claims against nondebtors that did not affect the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Court of Appeals upheld the injunction barring the assertion of \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d against Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurers it, too, understood these limits of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  MacArthur Corporation, a Manville asbestos distributor, claimed to be a coinsured under Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policies by virtue of \xe2\x80\x9cvendor endorsements\xe2\x80\x9d in those policies entitling distributors to insurance coverage for claims arising from their sale of Manville products.  MacArthur argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to issue the Insurance Settlement Order, which prevented it from suing the insurers, because this order constituted a <em>de facto </em>discharge in bankruptcy of nondebtor parties not entitled to Chapter 11 protection.  In rejecting MacArthur\xe2\x80\x99s argument, the Court of Appeals did not hold that the Bankruptcy Court possessed the authority to enjoin all actions against the insurers bearing some factual connection to Manville.  Rather, it held that MacArthur had misconstrued the scope of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s order, which precluded \xe2\x80\x9conly those suits against the settling insurers that arise out of or relate to Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MacArthur</em> <em>Co.</em> v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp</em>., 837 F.\xc2\xa02d 89, 91 (CA2 1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reasoned that this language enjoined MacArthur\xe2\x80\x99s claims because \xe2\x80\x9cMacArthur\xe2\x80\x99s rights as an insured vendor are completely derivative of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s rights as the primary insured.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 92.  Just as asbestos victims were \xe2\x80\x9cbarred from asserting direct actions against the insurers,\xe2\x80\x9d so too was MacArthur barred because \xe2\x80\x9c<em>in both instances, third parties seek to collect out of the proceeds of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policies on the basis of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s conduct</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 92\xe2\x80\x9393 (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeals further held that, because Manville\xe2\x80\x99s policies were property of the bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy Court had \xe2\x80\x9cproperly issued the orders pursuant to its equitable and statutory powers to dispose of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s property free and clear of third-party interests and to channel those interests to the proceeds thereby created.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 91.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court of Appeals recognized in the instant proceedings, its earlier interpretation of the Insurance Settlement Order in <em>MacArthur </em>did not and does not extend to the independent actions at issue in the instant suit: \xe2\x80\x9cTravelers candidly admits that both the statutory and common law claims seek damages from Travelers that are <em>unrelated</em> to the policy proceeds, quite unlike the claims in <em>MacArthur</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 where plaintiffs sought indemnification or compensation for the tortious wrongs of Manville to be paid out of the proceeds of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp., </em>517 F.\xc2\xa03d 52, 63 (CA2 2008).  Also in contrast to <em>MacArthur</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe claims at issue here do not seek to collect on the basis of Manville\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. \xe2\x80\xa6  Instead, the Plaintiffs seek to recover directly from Travelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order as enjoining only insurer actions and not independent actions is further supported by a statutory provision patterned after the Manville settlement.  In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress adopted 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7524(g) to expressly authorize the approach of the Manville bankruptcy in future asbestos-related bankruptcies.  In granting bankruptcy courts the power to provide injunctive relief to nondebtors, Congress stated that courts may bar an action directed against a third party who \xe2\x80\x9cis alleged to be <em>directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on the debtor </em>to the extent such alleged liability of such third party arises by reason of \xe2\x80\xa6 the third party\xe2\x80\x99s provision of insurance to the debtor or a related party.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7524(g)(4)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).  As the italicized language makes clear, the statute permits a bankruptcy court to enjoin actions seeking to proceed against a nondebtor insurer for a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s wrongdoing, but it does not confer power to enjoin independent actions arising out of the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s own wrongdoing.  See generally <em>In\xc2\xa0re Combustion Engineering, Inc.</em>, 391 F.\xc2\xa03d 190, 235, n.\xc2\xa047 (CA3 2004) (explaining that \xc2\xa7524(g), like the Manville injunction, is limited to insurer actions).  Had Congress interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy Claims\xe2\x80\x9d in the manner the Court does today, and had it sought to codify that definition, it would have used broader language.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it is worth asking why Travelers paid more than $400 million in 2004 to three new settlement funds in exchange for the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s order \xe2\x80\x9cclarifying\xe2\x80\x9d that the independent actions \xe2\x80\x9care\xe2\x80\x94and always have been\xe2\x80\x94permanently barred\xe2\x80\x9d by the 1986 injunction.

If the 1986 injunction were as clear as the Court assumes, surely Travelers would not have paid $445 million\xe2\x80\x94more than five times the amount of its initial contribution to the Manville Trust\xe2\x80\x94to obtain a redundant piece of paper.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I believe the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order did not enjoin independent actions of the sort giving rise to these proceedings.  A contrary conclusion ignores the limits of the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the order upheld on direct review in 1988, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 approval of the Manville reorganization, and Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 own conduct during both the 1986 and 2004 settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is an impermissible collateral attack is predicated on its determination that the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order plainly enjoined their independent actions.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Because I disagree with this premise, I also disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s preclusion analysis.  In challenging the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 order \xe2\x80\x9cclarifying\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of the Insurance Settlement Order, respondents were in fact timely appealing an order that <em>rewrote</em> the scope of the 1986 injunctions.  Their objection could not have been raised on direct appeal of the 1986 order because it was not an objection to anything in that order.  And, of course, the Court of Appeals did not rule on a challenge to the enjoining of independent actions during direct review, as the Court acknowledges.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa05.  To the contrary, it interpreted the 1986 order as reaching only insurer actions.  Thus, there neither was nor reasonably could have been a prior challenge that the 1986 order impermissibly enjoined independent actions.</p>\n<p align="left"><font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court regards respondents\xe2\x80\x99 challenge as a collateral attack, it brushes aside their jurisdictional objection to the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 order on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But neither respondents nor the Court of Appeals contested that point.  Rather, respondents argued that the Bankruptcy Court was not merely interpreting and enforcing its prior orders and that it had no jurisdiction to enjoin the independent actions when it approved the 2004 settlements.  The Court of Appeals accordingly examined whether the 2004 order improperly expanded the scope of the 1986 injunction and concluded that it did, thereby enjoining claims that were beyond the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to enjoin.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was correct.  The 1986 Insurance Settlement Order did not bar independent actions, and the Bankruptcy Court lacked any basis for enjoining those actions in 2004.  The independent actions have no effect on the bankruptcy estate, and \xe2\x80\x9cbankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceedings that have no effect on the debtor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Celotex Corp.</em> v. <em>Edwards</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/300/index.html">514 U. S. 300</a>, 309, n.\xc2\xa06 (1995).  The Court of Appeals thus correctly concluded that the Bankruptcy Court had impermissibly enjoined \xe2\x80\x9cclaims against Travelers that were predicated, as a matter of state law, on Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 own alleged misconduct and were unrelated to Manville\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policy proceeds and the <em>res</em> of the Manville estate.\xe2\x80\x9d  517 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 68.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I am persuaded that the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order did not encompass independent actions and that that Bankruptcy Court improperly enjoined such actions in 2004, I respectfully dissent. </p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The theories asserted in many of the state-law actions are novel, and, as the Court of Appeals noted, these claims \xe2\x80\x9chave met with almost universal failure in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johns-Manville Corp., </em>517 F.\xc2\xa03d 52, 68 (CA2 2008).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals noted that the Bankruptcy Court had not considered whether the various actions at issue were properly classified as insurer actions or independent actions, and it remanded for the Bankruptcy Court to undertake this assessment.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, the order confirming Manville\xe2\x80\x99s reorganization plan contains an additional injunction barring claims against the settling insurance companies.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa01.  The language in that order enjoins only insurer actions.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a\xe2\x80\x93288a<font b="1"> (enjoining actions against settling insurance companies seeking, directly or indirectly, to recover on or with respect to a \xe2\x80\x9cClaim, Interest, or Other Asbestos Obligation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 56a, n.\xc2\xa06 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cOther Asbestos Obligation\xe2\x80\x9d as an obligation arising directly or indirectly from acts or omissions of a debtor).  The parties accordingly focus on whether the Insurance Settlement Agreement enjoins independent actions.</font></p><font b="1">\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This statement of Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 intent belies the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that enjoining independent actions was a necessary condition of Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 contribution to the Manville estate.
