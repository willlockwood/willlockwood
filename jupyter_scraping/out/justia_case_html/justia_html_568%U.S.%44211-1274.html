And this reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts ends, advancing \xe2\x80\x9cthe basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose, elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity for recovery and a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s potential liabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rotella v.

That doctrine is an \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d to the standard rule, and delays accrual \xe2\x80\x9cuntil a plaintiff has \xe2\x80\x98discovered\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d his cause of action.  Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  It arose from the recognition that \xe2\x80\x9csomething different was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and \xe2\x80\x98remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Holmberg v. Armbrecht, \n\n327 U.\xc2\xa0S. 392\n.  This Court, however, has never applied the discovery rule in this context, where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is instead the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s case is not saved by Exploration Co. v. United States, \n\n247 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435\n.  There, the discovery rule was applied in favor of the Government, but the Government was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss.  It was not bringing an enforcement action for penalties.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been extended to Government civil penalty enforcement actions.  The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have no reason to suspect fraud.  The Government is a different kind of plaintiff.  The SEC\xe2\x80\x99s very purpose, for example, is to root out fraud, and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit.  The Government in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.  The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers.  Emphasizing the importance of time limits on penalty actions, Chief Justice Marshall admonished that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws\xe2\x80\x9d if actions for penalties could \xe2\x80\x9cbe brought at any distance of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342.  Yet grafting the discovery rule onto \xc2\xa72462 would raise similar concerns.  It would leave defendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into the future.  And repose would hinge on speculation about what the Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known it.  Deciding when the Government knew or reasonably should have known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the courts, such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing Government knowledge, whether and how to consider agency priorities and resource constraints in deciding when the Government reasonably should have known of a fraud, and so on.  Applying a discovery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and the Court declines to do so.

Because funds often hold securities traded on different exchanges around the world, their reported valuation may be based on stale information.  If a mutual fund\xe2\x80\x99s reported valuation is artificially low compared to its real value, market timers will buy that day and sell the next to realize quick profits.

This Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and \xe2\x80\x98remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Holmberg v.

Despite the discovery rule\xe2\x80\x99s centuries-old roots, the Government cites no lower court case before 2008 employing a fraud-based discovery rule in a Government enforcement action for civil penalties.  See Brief for Respondent 23 (citing SEC v. Tambone, 550 F.\xc2\xa03d 106, 148\xe2\x80\x93149 (CA1 2008); SEC v. Koenig, 557 F.\xc2\xa03d 736, 739 (CA7 2009)).  When pressed at oral argument, the Government conceded that it was aware of no such case.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.  The Government was also unable to point to any example from the first 160 years after enactment of this statute of limitations where it had even asserted that the fraud discovery rule applied in such a context.

United States, \n\n247 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435 (1918)\n, in an attempt to show that the discovery rule should benefit the Government to the same extent as private parties.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondent 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 16, 17, 33\xe2\x80\x9334, 41\xe2\x80\x9345.  In that  case, a company had fraudulently procured land from the United States, and the United States sued to undo the trans- action.  The company raised the statute of limitations as a defense, but this Court allowed the case to proceed, concluding that the rule \xe2\x80\x9cthat statutes of limitations upon suits to set aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin to run until the discovery of the fraud\xe2\x80\x9d applied \xe2\x80\x9cin favor of the Government as well as a private individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Exploration Co., supra, at 449.  But in Exploration Co., the Government was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss.  The Government was not bringing an enforcement action for penalties.  Exploration Co. cannot save the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been extended to Government enforcement actions for civil penalties.  The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of victims who do not know they are injured and who reasonably do not inquire as to any injury.  Usually when a private party is injured, he is imme- diately aware of that injury and put on notice that his time to sue is running.  But when the injury is self-concealing, private parties may be unaware that they have been harmed.  Most of us do not live in a state of constant investigation; absent any reason to think we have been injured, we do not typically spend our days looking for evidence that we were lied to or defrauded.  And the law does not require that we do so.  Instead, courts have developed the discovery rule, providing that the statute of limitations in fraud cases should typically begin to run only when the injury is or reasonably could have been discovered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same conclusion does not follow for the Government in the context of enforcement actions for civil penalties.  The SEC, for example, is not like an individual victim who relies on apparent injury to learn of a wrong.  Rather, a central \xe2\x80\x9cmission\xe2\x80\x9d of the Commission is to \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigat[e] potential violations of the federal securities laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  SEC, Enforcement Manual 1 (2012).  Unlike the private party who has no reason to suspect fraud, the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s very purpose is to root it out, and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit.  It can demand that securities brokers and dealers submit detailed trading information.  Id., at 44.  It can require investment advisers to turn over their comprehensive books and records at any time.  \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780b\xe2\x80\x934 (2006 ed. and Supp. V).  And even without fil- ing suit, it can subpoena any documents and witnesses  it deems relevant or material to an investigation.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777s(c), 78u(b), 80a\xe2\x80\x9341(b), 80b\xe2\x80\x939(b) (2006 ed.).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe SEC is also authorized to pay monetary awards to whistleblowers, who provide information relating to violations of the securities laws.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936 (2006 ed., Supp. V).  In addition, the SEC may offer \xe2\x80\x9ccooperation agreements\xe2\x80\x9d to violators to procure information about others in exchange for more lenient treatment.  See Enforcement Manual, at 119\xe2\x80\x93137.  Charged with this mission and armed with these weapons, the SEC as enforcer is a far cry from the defrauded victim the discovery rule evolved to protect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a civil penalty action, the Government is not only a different kind of plaintiff, it seeks a different kind of relief.  The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recompense.  But this case involves penalties, which go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers.  See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n\n236 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412, \n423 (1915)\n (a penalty covered by the predecessor to \xc2\xa72462 is \xe2\x80\x9csomething imposed in a punitive way for an infraction of a public law\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Tull v. United States, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412, \n422 (1987)\n (penalties are \xe2\x80\x9cintended to punish culpable individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cto extract compensation or restore the status quo\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChief Justice Marshall used particularly forceful language in emphasizing the importance of time limits on penalty actions, stating that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws\xe2\x80\x9d if actions for penalties could \xe2\x80\x9cbe brought at any distance of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342 (1805).  \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet grafting the discovery rule onto \xc2\xa72462 would raise similar concerns.  It would leave defendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into the future.  Repose would hinge on speculation about what the Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known it.  See Rotella, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 554 (disapproving a rule that would have \xe2\x80\x9cextended the limitations period to many decades\xe2\x80\x9d because such a rule was \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond any limit that Congress could have contemplated\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould have thwarted the basic objective of repose underlying the very notion of a limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetermining when the Government, as opposed to an individual, knew or reasonably should have known of a fraud presents particular challenges for the courts.  Agencies often have hundreds of employees, dozens of offices, and several levels of leadership.  In such a case, when does \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government\xe2\x80\x9d know of a violation?  Who is the relevant actor?  Different agencies often have overlapping responsibilities; is the knowledge of one attributed to all?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn determining what a plaintiff should have known, we ask what facts \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Merck &amp; Co., 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  It is unclear whether and how courts should consider agency priorities and resource constraints in applying that test to Government enforcement actions.  See 3M Co. v. Browner, 17 F.\xc2\xa03d 1453, 1461 (CADC 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn agency may experience problems in detecting statutory violations because its enforcement effort is not sufficiently funded; or because the agency has not devoted an adequate number of trained personnel to the task; or because the agency\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement program is ill-designed or inefficient; or because the nature of the statute makes it difficult to uncover violations; or because of some combination of these factors and others\xe2\x80\x9d).  And in the midst of any inquiry as to what it knew when, the Government can be expected to assert various privileges, such as law enforcement, attorney-client, work product, or deliberative process, further complicating judicial attempts to apply the discovery rule.  See, e.g., App. in No. 10\xe2\x80\x933581 (CA2), p. 147 (Government invoking such privileges in this case, in response to a request for documents relating to the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of Headstart); see also Rotella, supra, at 559 (rejecting a rule in part due to \xe2\x80\x9cthe controversy inherent in divining when a plaintiff should have discovered\xe2\x80\x9d a wrong).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, Congress has expressly required such inquiries in some statutes.  But in many of those instances, the Government is itself an injured victim looking for recompense, not a prosecutor seeking penalties.  See, e.g., 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72415, 2416(c) (Government suits for money dam- ages founded on contracts or torts).  Moreover, statutes applying a discovery rule in the context of Govern- ment suits often couple that rule with an absolute provision for repose, which a judicially imposed discovery rule would lack.  See, e.g., \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7335b(b)(3) (limiting certain Government civil penalty actions to \xe2\x80\x9c6 years after the date when facts material to the act are known or reasonably should have been known by the Secretary but in no event more than 10 years after the date the act took place\xe2\x80\x9d).  And several statutes applying a discovery rule to the Government make some effort to identify the official whose knowledge is relevant.  See \n\n31 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73731(b)(2) (relevant knowledge is that of \xe2\x80\x9cthe official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying a discovery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and we have no mandate from Congress to undertake that challenge here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we held long ago, the cases in which \xe2\x80\x9ca statute of limitation may be suspended by causes not mentioned in the statute itself .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are very limited in character, and are to be admitted with great caution; otherwise the court would make the law instead of administering it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Amy v.
