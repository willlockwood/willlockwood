Argued December 3, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided February 24, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">After petitioner Doe filed a black lung benefits claim with the Department of Labor, the agency used his Social Security number to identify his claim on official agency documents, including a multicaptioned hearing notice that was sent to a group of claimants, their employers, and lawyers.  Doe and other black lung claimants sued the Department, claiming that such disclosures violated the Privacy Act of 1974.  The Government stipulated to an order prohibiting future publication of Social Security numbers on multicaptioned hearing notices, and the parties moved for summary judgment.  The District Court entered judgment against all plaintiffs but Doe, finding that they had raised no issues of cognizable harm.  However, the court accepted Doe\xe2\x80\x99s uncontroverted testimony about his distress on learning of the improper disclosure, granted him summary judgment, and awarded him $1,000, the minimum statutory damages award under 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).  The Fourth Circuit reversed on Doe\xe2\x80\x99s claim, holding that the $1,000 minimum is available only to plaintiffs who suffer actual damages, and that Doe had not raised a triable issue of fact about such damages, having submitted no corroboration for his emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs must prove some actual damages to qualify for the minimum statutory award.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Privacy Act gives agencies detailed instructions for managing their records and provides various sorts of civil relief to persons aggrieved by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  Doe\xe2\x80\x99s claim falls within a catchall category for someone who suffers an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effect\xe2\x80\x9d from a failure not otherwise specified in the remedial section of the Act.  \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(D).  If a court determines in a subsection (g)(1)(D) suit that the agency acted in an \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or willful\xe2\x80\x9d manner, the Government is liable for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages sustained by the individual \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than \xe2\x80\xa6 $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A).  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0A straightforward textual analysis supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that the minimum guarantee goes only to victims who prove some actual damages.  By the time the statute guarantees the $1,000 minimum, it not only has confined eligibility to victims of adverse effects caused by intentional or willful actions, but has provided expressly for liability to such victims for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the next clause of the sentence containing such an explicit provision guarantees $1,000 to the \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d the obvious referent is the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s sole provision for recovering anything.  Doe\xe2\x80\x99s theory that the minimum requires nothing more than proof of a statutory violation is immediately questionable in ignoring the \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d language so directly at hand and instead looking for \xe2\x80\x9ca person entitled to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate part of the statute devoid of any mention of recovery or of what might be recovered.  Doe ignores statutory language by reading the statute to speak of liability in a freestanding, unqualified way, when it actually speaks in a limited way, by referencing enumerated damages.  His reading is also at odds with the traditional understanding that tort recovery requires both wrongful act plus causation and proof of some harm for which damages can reasonably be assessed.  And an uncodified provision of the Act demonstrates that Congress left for another day the question whether to authorize general damages, <em>i.e.,</em> an award calculated without reference to specific harm.  In fact, drafting history shows that Congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized such damages.  Finally, Doe\xe2\x80\x99s reading leaves the entitlement to recovery reference with no job to do.  As he treats the text, Congress could have accomplished its object simply by providing that the Government would be liable for actual damages but in no case less than $1,000.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Doe\xe2\x80\x99s argument suggests that it would have been illogical for Congress to create a cause of action for anyone suffering an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action, then deny recovery without actual damages.  But subsection (g)(1)(D)\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of a civil action was not meant to provide a complete cause of action.  A subsequent provision requires proof of intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect, and if the specific state of mind must be proven additionally, it is consistent with logic to require some actual damages as well.  Doe also suggests that it is peculiar to offer guaranteed damages, as a form of presumed damages not requiring proof of amount, only to plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages.  But this approach parallels the common-law remedial scheme for certain defamation claims in which plaintiffs can recover presumed damages only if they can demonstrate some actual, quantifiable pecuniary loss.  Finally, Doe points to subsequently enacted statutes with remedial provisions similar to \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).  However, the text of one provision is too far different from the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s language to serve as a sound basis for analogy; and even as to the other provisions, this Court has said repeatedly that subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment.

The question before us is whether plaintiffs must prove some actual damages to qualify for a minimum statutory award of $1,000.  We hold that they must.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Buck Doe filed for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 83 Stat. 792, 30 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7901 <em>et seq.</em>, with the Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs, the division of the Department of Labor responsible for adjudicating it.  The application form called for a Social Security number, which the agency then used to identify the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s claim, as on documents like \xe2\x80\x9cmulticaptioned\xe2\x80\x9d notices of hearing dates, sent to groups of claimants, their employers, and the lawyers involved in their cases.  The Government concedes that following this practice led to disclosing Doe\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security number beyond the limits set by the Privacy Act.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doe joined with six other black lung claimants to sue the Department of Labor, alleging repeated violations of the Act and seeking certification of a class of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all claimants for Black Lung Benefits since the passage of the Privacy Act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. 6a.  Early on, the United States stipulated to an order prohibiting future publication of applicants\xe2\x80\x99 Social Security numbers on multicaptioned hearing notices, and the parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The District Court denied class certification and entered judgment against all individual plaintiffs except Doe, finding that their submissions had raised no issues of cognizable harm.  As to Doe, the Court accepted his uncontroverted evidence of distress on learning of the improper disclosure, granted summary judgment, and awarded $1,000 in statutory damages under 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed on Doe\xe2\x80\x99s claim, holding the United States entitled to summary judgment across the board.  306 F.\xc2\xa03d 170 (2002).  The Circuit treated the $1,000 statutory minimum as available only to plaintiffs who suffered actual damages because of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s violation, <em>id.</em>, at 176\xe2\x80\x93179, and then found that Doe had not raised a triable issue of fact about actual damages, having submitted no corroboration for his claim of emotional distress, such as evidence of physical symptoms, medical treatment, loss of income, or impact on his behavior.  In fact, the only indication of emotional affliction was Doe\xe2\x80\x99s conclusory allegations that he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98torn \xe2\x80\xa6 all to pieces\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98greatly concerned and worried\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because of the disclosure of his Social Security number and its potentially \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98devastating\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d consequences.  <em>Id.,</em> at 181.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doe petitioned for review of the holding that some actual damages must be proven before a plaintiff may receive the minimum statutory award.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Because the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision requiring proof of actual damages conflicted with the views of other Circuits, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Orekoya </em>v. <em>Mooney</em>, 330 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 7\xe2\x80\x938 (CA1 2003); <em>Wilborn </em>v. <em>Department of Health and Human Servs.</em>, 49 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 603 (CA9 1995); <em>Waters</em> v. <em>Thornburgh</em>, 888 F.\xc2\xa02d 870, 872 (CADC 1989); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Department of Treasury</em>, 700 F.\xc2\xa02d 971, 977, and n.\xc2\xa012 (CA5 1983); <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>IRS</em>, 665 F.\xc2\xa02d 327, 330\xe2\x80\x93331 (CA11 1982), we granted certiorari.  539 U.

The Act gives agencies detailed instructions for managing their records and provides for various sorts of civil relief to individuals aggrieved by failures on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s part to comply with the requirements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (g)(1) recognizes a civil action for agency misconduct fitting within any of four categories (the fourth, in issue here, being a catchall), 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(D), and then makes separate provision for the redress of each.  The first two categories cover deficient management of records: subsection (g)(1)(A) provides for the correction of any inaccurate or otherwise improper material in a record, and subsection (g)(1)(B) provides a right of access against any agency refusing to allow an individual to inspect a record kept on him.  In each instance, further provisions specify such things as the <em>de novo</em> nature of the suit (as distinct from any form of deferential review), \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(g)(2)(A), (g)(3)(A), and mechanisms for exercising judicial equity jurisdiction (by <em>in camera</em> inspection, for example), \xc2\xa7552a(g)(3)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two remaining categories deal with derelictions having consequences beyond the statutory violations <em>per se.</em>  Subsection (g)(1)(C) describes an agency\xe2\x80\x99s failure to maintain an adequate record on an individual, when the result is a determination \xe2\x80\x9cadverse\xe2\x80\x9d to that person.  Subsection (g)(1)(D) speaks of a violation when someone suffers an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effect\xe2\x80\x9d from any other failure to hew to the terms of the Act.  Like the inspection and correction infractions, breaches of the statute with adverse consequences are addressed by specific terms governing relief:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A)\xc2\xa0actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B)\xc2\xa0the costs of the action together with reason-\nable attorney fees as determined by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doe argues that subsection (g)(4)(A) entitles any plaintiff adversely affected by an intentional or willful violation to the $1,000 minimum on proof of nothing more than a statutory violation: anyone suffering an adverse consequence of intentional or willful disclosure is entitled to recovery.  The Government claims the minimum guarantee goes only to victims who prove some actual dam-\nages.  We think the Government has the better side of the argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position is supported by a straightforward textual analysis.  When the statute gets to the point of guaranteeing the $1,000 minimum, it not only has confined any eligibility to victims of adverse effects caused by intentional or willful actions, but has provided expressly for liability to such victims for \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d  It has made specific provision, in other words, for what a victim within the limited class may recover.  When the very next clause of the sentence containing the explicit provision guarantees $1,000 to a \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d the simplest reading of that phrase looks back to the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages, which is also the Act\xe2\x80\x99s sole provision for recovering anything (as distinct from equitable relief).  With such an obvious referent for \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d in the plaintiff who sustains \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages,\xe2\x80\x9d Doe\xe2\x80\x99s theory is immediately questionable in ignoring the \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d language so directly at hand and instead looking for \xe2\x80\x9ca person entitled to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate part of the statute devoid of any mention either of recovery or of what might be recovered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is it too strong to say that Doe does ignore statutory language.  When Doe reads the statute to mean that the United States shall be liable to any adversely affected subject of an intentional or willful violation, without more, he treats willful action as the last fact necessary to make the Government \xe2\x80\x9cliable,\xe2\x80\x9d and he is thus able to describe anyone to whom it is liable as entitled to the $1,000 guarantee.  But this way of reading the statute simply pays no attention to the fact that the statute does not speak of liability (and consequent entitlement to recovery) in a freestanding, unqualified way, but in a limited way, by reference to enumerated damages.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doe\xe2\x80\x99s manner of reading \xe2\x80\x9centitle[ment] to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d as satisfied by adverse effect caused by intentional or willful violation is in tension with more than the text, however.  It is at odds with the traditional understanding that tort recovery requires not only wrongful act plus causation reaching to the plaintiff, but proof of some harm for which damages can reasonably be assessed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> W.\xc2\xa0Keeton, D.\xc2\xa0Dobbs, R.\xc2\xa0Keeton, &amp; D.\xc2\xa0Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa730 (5th ed. 1984).  Doe, instead, identifies a person as entitled to recover without any reference to proof of damages, actual or otherwise.  Doe might respond that it makes sense to speak of a privacy tort victim as entitled to recover without reference to damages because analogous common law would not require him to show particular items of injury in order to receive a dollar recovery.  Traditionally, the common law has provided such victims with a claim for \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d damages, which for privacy and defamation torts are presumed damages: a monetary award calculated without reference to specific harm.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a rejoinder would not pass muster under the Privacy Act, however, because a provision of the Act not previously mentioned indicates beyond serious doubt that general damages are not authorized for a statutory violation.  An uncodified section of the Act established a Privacy Protection Study Commission, which was charged, among its other jobs, to consider \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the Federal Government should be liable for general damages incurred by an individual as the result of a willful or intentional violation of the provisions of sections 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) of title 5.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  \xc2\xa75(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat. 1907.  Congress left the question of general damages, that is, for another day.  Because presumed damages are therefore clearly unavailable, we have no business treating just any adversely affected victim of an intentional or willful violation as entitled to recovery, without something more.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This inference from the terms of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s mandate is underscored by drafting history showing that Congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized any presumed damages.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Senate bill would have authorized an award of \xe2\x80\x9cactual and general damages sustained by any person,\xe2\x80\x9d with that language followed by the guarantee that \xe2\x80\x9cin no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7303(c)(1) (1974).  Although the provision for general damages would have covered presumed damages, see n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra,</em> this language was trimmed from the final statute, subject to any later revision that might be recommended by the Commission.  The deletion of \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral damages\xe2\x80\x9d from the bill is fairly seen, then, as a deliberate elimination of any possibility of imputing harm and awarding presumed damages.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The deletion thus precludes any hope of a sound interpretation of entitlement to recovery without reference to actual damages.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Doe\xe2\x80\x99s reading is open to the objection that no purpose is served by conditioning the guarantee on a person\xe2\x80\x99s being entitled to recovery.  As Doe treats the text, Congress could have accomplished its object simply by providing that the Government would be liable to the individual for actual damages \xe2\x80\x9cbut in no case \xe2\x80\xa6 less than the sum of $1,000\xe2\x80\x9d plus fees and costs.  Doe\xe2\x80\x99s reading leaves the reference to entitlement to recovery with no job to do, and it accordingly accomplishes nothing.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are three loose ends.  Doe\xe2\x80\x99s argument suggests it would have been illogical for Congress to create a cause of action for anyone who suffers an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action, then deny recovery without actual damages.  But this objection assumes that the language in subsection (g)(1)(D) recognizing a federal \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of someone adversely affected was meant, without more, to provide a complete cause of action, and of course this is not so.  A subsequent provision requires proof of intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect, and if the specific state of mind must be proven additionally, it is equally consistent with logic to require some actual damages as well.  Nor does our view deprive the language recognizing a civil action by an adversely affected person of any independent effect, for it may readily be understood as having a limited but specific function: the reference in \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(D) to \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effect\xe2\x80\x9d acts as a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article III standing, and who may consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of standing to sue.  See <em>Director, Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs</em> v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/122/index.html">514 U. S. 122</a>, 126 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe phrase \xe2\x80\x98person adversely affected or aggrieved\xe2\x80\x99 is a term of art used in many statutes to designate those who have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision, within the agency or before the courts\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702 (providing review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act to individuals who have been \xe2\x80\x9cadversely affected or aggrieved\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is, an individual subjected to an adverse effect has injury enough to open the courthouse door, but without more has no cause of action for damages under the Privacy Act.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, Doe also suggests there is something peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages, as a form of presumed damages not requiring proof of amount, only to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages.  But this approach parallels another remedial scheme that the drafters of the Privacy Act would probably have known about.  At common law, certain defamation torts were redressed by general damages but only when a plaintiff first proved some \xe2\x80\x9cspecial harm,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9charm of a material and generally of a pecuniary nature.\xe2\x80\x9d   3 Restatement of Torts \xc2\xa7575, Comments <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (1938) (discussing defamation torts that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot actionable per se\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7575, Comments <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (1976) (same).  Plaintiffs claiming such torts could recover presumed damages only if they could demonstrate some actual, quantifiable pecuniary loss.  Because the recovery of presumed damages in these cases was supplemental to compensation for specific harm, it was hardly unprecedented for Congress to make a guaranteed minimum contingent upon some showing of actual damages, thereby avoiding giveaways to plaintiffs with nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cabstract injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/95/index.html">461 U.

See Tax Reform Act of 1976, \xc2\xa71201(i)(2)(A), 90 Stat. 1665\xe2\x80\x931666, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76110(j)(2)(A); \xc2\xa71202(e)(1), 90 Stat. 1687, 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77217(c) (1976 ed., Supp. V) (repealed 1982); Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, \xc2\xa7201, 100 Stat. 1866, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72707(c).  He contends that legislative history of these subsequent enactments shows that Congress sometimes used language similar to 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4) with the object of authorizing true liquidated damages remedies.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93938, p.\xc2\xa0348 (1976) (discussing \xc2\xa71202(e)(1) of the Tax Reform Act); S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93541, p.\xc2\xa043 (1986) (discussing \xc2\xa7201 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act).  There are two problems with this argument.  First, as to \xc2\xa71201(i)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act, the text is too far different from the language of the Privacy Act to serve as any sound basis for analogy; it does not include the critical limiting phrase \xe2\x80\x9centitled to recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  But even as to \xc2\xa71202(e)(1) of the Tax Reform Act and \xc2\xa7201 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the trouble with Doe\xe2\x80\x99s position is its reliance on the legislative histories of completely separate statutes passed well after the Privacy Act.  Those of us who look to legislative history have been wary about expecting to find reliable interpretive help outside the record of the statute being construed, and we have said repeatedly that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. </em>v. <em>Army Corps of Engineers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/159/index.html">531 U.

The first bill passed by the Senate authorized recovery of both actual and general damages.  See <em>infra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  At that point, when discussing eligibility for the $1,000 guarantee, it was reasonable to refer to plaintiffs with either sort of damages by the general term \xe2\x80\x9ca person entitled to recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  When subsequent amendment limited recovery to actual damages by eliminating the general, no one apparently thought to delete the inclusive reference to entitlement.

See 306 F.\xc2\xa03d 170, 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (CA4 2002).  Instead of treating damages as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees, see, <em>e.g., </em>42 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 35; Brief for Respondent (I).  Nor does the Government here contest that Buck Doe, the only petitioner before us, suffered an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effect\xe2\x80\x9d from the Privacy Act violation.

The words \xe2\x80\x9ca person entitled to recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d as used in \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s remedial prescription, are most sensibly read to include anyone experiencing an \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effect\xe2\x80\x9d as a consequence of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s intentional or willful commission of a Privacy Act violation of the kind described in \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D).  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and purpose warrant this construction, under which Doe need not show a current pecuniary loss, or \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d of some other sort, to recover the minimum award of $1,000, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 552a(g)(4) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(A) actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(B) the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe opening clause of \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4) prescribes two conditions on which liability depends.  <em>First</em>, the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s suit must lie under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D); both provisions require an agency action \xe2\x80\x9cadverse\xe2\x80\x9d to the claimant.  Section 552a(g)(1)(C) authorizes a civil action when an agency \xe2\x80\x9cfails to maintain [a] record concerning [an] individual with [the] accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness\xe2\x80\x9d needed to determine fairly \xe2\x80\x9cthe qualifications, character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual,\xe2\x80\x9d if the agency\xe2\x80\x99s lapse yields a \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>adverse to the individual</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Section 552a(g)(1)(D) allows a civil action when an agency \xe2\x80\x9cfails to comply with [a] provision of [\xc2\xa7552a], or [a] rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have <em>an adverse effect on an individual</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  <em>Second</em>, the agency action triggering the suit under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) must have been \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or willful.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).  If those two liability-determining conditions are satisfied (suit under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D); intentional or willful conduct), the next clause specifies the consequences: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of\xe2\x80\x9d the recovery allowed under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A) and the costs and fees determined under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to recovery\xe2\x80\x9d appear only in the text describing the relief attendant upon the agency\xe2\x80\x99s statutory dereliction; they do not appear in the preceding text describing the conditions on which the agency\xe2\x80\x99s liability turns.  Most reasonably read, \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)(A) does not wend back to add \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d as a third liability-determining element.

Congress sought to afford recovery for \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> damages\xe2\x80\x9d resulting from the \xe2\x80\x9cwillful or intentional\xe2\x80\x9d violation of \xe2\x80\x9cany individual\xe2\x80\x99s rights under th[e] Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72(b)(6), 88 Stat. 1896 (emphasis added).  Privacy Act violations commonly cause fear, anxiety, or other emotional distress\xe2\x80\x94in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s parlance, \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harm of this character must, of course, be proved genuine.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In cases like Doe\xe2\x80\x99s, emotional distress is generally the only harm the claimant suffers, <em>e.g.</em>, the identity theft apprehended never materializes.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears emphasis that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive relief when suit is maintained under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D).  Injunctive relief, and attendant counsel fees and costs, are available under the Act in two categories of cases: suits to amend a record, \xc2\xa7552a(g)(2), and suits for access to a record, \xc2\xa7552a(g)(3).  But for cases like Doe\xe2\x80\x99s, brought under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D), see <em>supra</em>, at 2, only monetary relief is available.  Hence, in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, if a plaintiff who sues under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) fails to prove actual damages, \xe2\x80\x9che will not be entitled to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 39 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Privacy Act permits an award only of \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of an attorney fee award is the degree of success obtained.  For a plaintiff who enjoys no success in prosecuting his claim, \xe2\x80\x98the only reasonable fee\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98no fee at all.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Farrar</em> v. <em>Hobby,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/103/index.html">506 U.

The following colloquy from oral argument is illustrative.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Court: \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose . . .

Nevertheless, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s examples of what might qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d indicate that its disagreement with the construction of the Act prevailing in the Circuits, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, is ethereal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, although recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cactual damages\xe2\x80\x9d may be slender and easy to generate, fears depletion of the federal fisc were the Court to adopt Doe\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).

No doubt mindful that Congress did not endorse massive recoveries, the District Court in this very case denied class-action certification, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, and other courts have similarly refused to certify suits seeking damages under \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4)<font b="1"> as class actions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Schmidt</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, 218 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 619, 637 (ED Wis. 2003) (denying class certification on ground that each individual would have to prove he \xe2\x80\x9csuffered an adverse effect as a result of the [agency]\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with [the Act]\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lyon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 94 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 69, 76 (WD Okla. 1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn Privacy Act damages actions, questions affecting only individual members greatly outweigh questions of law and fact common to the class.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Furthermore, courts have disallowed the runaway liability that might ensue were they to count every single wrongful disclosure as a discrete basis for a $1,000 award.

See <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa010.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In my view, Congress gave Privacy Act suitors like Doe not only standing to sue, but the right to a recovery if the fact trier credits their claims of emotional distress brought on by an agency\xe2\x80\x99s intentional or willful violation of the Act.  For the reasons stated in this dissenting opinion, which track the reasons expressed by Circuit Judge Michael dissenting in part in the Fourth Circuit, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court interprets \xe2\x80\x9cthe reference in \xc2\xa7552a(g)(1)(D) to \xe2\x80\x98adverse effect\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 as a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article III standing, and who may consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of standing to sue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.

In this Court and case, as earlier noted, <em>supra</em>, at 1, the Government does not challenge the finding that the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s violation of the Act was \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or willful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 96a\xe2\x80\x9397a (Characterizing the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s actions as \xe2\x80\x9cintentional and willful,\xe2\x80\x9d the Magistrate Judge observed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe undisputed evidence shows that the Department took little, if any, action to see that it complied with the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0Several of the Administrative Law Judges responsible for sending out the multi-captioned hearing notices testified that they had received no training on the Privacy Act.\xe2\x80\x9d).

I emphasize Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s view that the statute (as we interpret it) is not likely to produce \xe2\x80\x9cmassive recoveries\xe2\x80\x9d against the Government\xe2\x80\x94recoveries that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not endorse.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (dissenting opinion).  I concede that the statute would lead to monetary recoveries whenever the Government\xe2\x80\x99s violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 is \xe2\x80\x9cintentional or willful.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(g)(4).  But the Government at oral argument pointed out that the phrase</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intentional or willful\xe2\x80\x99 has been construed by the lower courts as essentially a term of art, and the prevailing test . . . is . . . akin to the standard that would prevail in a <em>Bivens</em> action[:] . . . \xe2\x80\x98[C]ould a reasonable officer in this person\xe2\x80\x99s position have believed what he was doing was legal?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\xe2\x80\x9334 (internal quotation marks added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThat is to say, the lower courts have interpreted the phrase restrictively, essentially applying it where the Government\xe2\x80\x99s violation of the Act is in bad faith.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Albright</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 732 F.\xc2\xa02d 181, 189 (CADC 1984) (the term means \xe2\x80\x9cwithout grounds for believing [an action] to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others\xe2\x80\x99 rights under the Act\xe2\x80\x9d); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Scrimgeour</em> v. <em>IRS</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa03d 318, 326 (CA4 1998) (same); <em>Wisdom</em> v. <em>Department of Housing and Urban Development</em>, 713 F.\xc2\xa02d 422, 424\xe2\x80\x93435 (CA8 1983) (same); <em>Pippinger</em> v. <em>Rubin</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 519, 530 (CA10 1997) (same); <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Reno</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa03d 1193, 1205 (CA6 1997) (similar), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Pollard</em> v. <em>E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/843/index.html">532 U. S. 843</a>, 848 (2001); <em>Moskiewicz</em> v. <em>Department of Agriculture</em>, 791 F.\xc2\xa02d 561, 564 (CA7 1986) (similar); <em>Wilborn</em> v. <em>Department of Health and Human Servs.</em>, 49 F.\xc2\xa03d 597, 602\n(CA9 1995) (similar).  But cf. <em>Covert</em> v. <em>Harrington</em>, 876 F.\xc2\xa02d 751, 757 (CA9 1989) (apparently applying a broader standard). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given this prevailing interpretation, the Government need not fear liability based upon a technical, accidental, or good faith violation of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s detailed provisions.  Hence Justice Ginsburg\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would not risk injury to the public fisc.  And I consequently find no support in any of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive reading of the damages provision.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></div>'
