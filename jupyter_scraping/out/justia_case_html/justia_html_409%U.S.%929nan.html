The question is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="931">Page 409 U.S. 929 , 931</a></p><p> therefore no more \'political\' in this case than in Flast. </p><p> There has in the past been much confusion over the distinction between a \'political\' question and one that is \'justiciable.\' We dispelled much of that confusion-Baker v. Carr, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html#217">369 U.S. 186, 217</a>, 7 L. Ed.2d 663, when we said: </p><ul>\'It is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question. although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court\'s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\'</ul> <p> We added that a bona fide controversy \'as to whether some action denominated political exceeds constitutional authority\' cannot be rejected by the courts. Ibid. </p><p> Whether after full argument and deliberation we would hold that this case falls in the category of Flast v. Cohen is unknown. But certainly the issue is important and substantial. The provisions in Art. I, 8, cl. 11, which give Congress, not the President, the power to \'declare war\' is a specific grant of power that impliedly bars its exercise by the Executive Branch. And the power </p><p><a class="page-number" name="932">Page 409 U.S. 929 , 932</a></p><p> is so pervasive in its reach that it may effect the lives, the property, and well-being of the entire Nation. Arguably the principles announced in Flast v. Cohen control this case. </p><p> I would therefore grant the petition and put the case down for oral argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] I have previously filed dissents in various cases tendering this question, the Court having consistently refused to entertain them.
