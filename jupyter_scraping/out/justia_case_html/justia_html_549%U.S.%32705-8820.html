The application is therefore not \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d after the state court\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction review is complete.  If it were, it is difficult to understand how a state prisoner could exhaust state postconviction remedies without filing a certiorari petition.  Yet state prisoners need not petition for certiorari to exhaust state remedies.  <em>Fay</em> v. <em>Noia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/index.html">372 U. S. 391</a>, 435\xe2\x80\x93438.

While \xe2\x80\x9cdirect review\xe2\x80\x9d has long included review by this Court, <em>Clay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/522/index.html">537 U. S. 522</a>, 527\xe2\x80\x93528, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) refers exclusively to \xe2\x80\x9cState post-conviction or other collateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d language not easily interpreted to include participation by a federal court.  And although the \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking\xe2\x80\x9d direct review includes the period for filing a certiorari petition, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) makes no reference to the \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking\xe2\x80\x9d review of a state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Instead, it seeks to know when a state review application is pending.  A more analogous statutory provision, \xc2\xa72263(b)(2), contains a limitations period that is tolled \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although this differs from \xc2\xa72244(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s language, the language used in both sections clearly provides that tolling hinges on the pendency of state review.  This interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), results in few practical problems.  Because this Court rarely grants review of state postconviction proceedings, it is unlikely that a federal district court would duplicate this Court\xe2\x80\x99s work or analysis.  In any event, a district court concerned about duplication can stay a habeas application until this Court acts.  Even in the extremely rare case in which a state court grants relief and the State prevails on certiorari, a prisoner whose subsequent federal habeas petition may be entitled to equitable tolling in light of arguably extraordinary circumstances and the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s diligence.  See <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U. S. 408</a>, 418, and n. 8.

We must decide whether a state application is still \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d when the state courts have entered a final judgment on the matter but a petition for certiorari has been filed in this Court.  We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Gary Lawrence and his wife used a pipe and baseball bat to kill Michael Finken.  A Florida jury convicted Lawrence of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, auto theft, and petty theft.  The trial court sentenced Lawrence to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence on appeal, and this Court denied certiorari on January 20, 1998.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/1080/index.html">522 U.

See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>State</em>,<em> </em>831 So.\xc2\xa02d 121 (per curiam).  Lawrence sought review of the denial of state postconviction relief in this Court.  We denied certiorari on March 24, 2003.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/926/index.html">538 U.

The Federal District Court dismissed it as untimely under \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period.  All but one day of the limitations period had lapsed during the 364 days between the time Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final and when he filed for state postconviction relief.  The limitations period was then tolled while the Florida courts entertained his state application.  After the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate, Lawrence waited another 113 days\xe2\x80\x94well beyond the one day that remained in the limitations period\xe2\x80\x94to file his federal habeas application.  As a consequence, his federal application could be considered timely only if the limitations period continued to be tolled during this Court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of his petition for certiorari.  Then-applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent foreclosed any argument that \xc2\xa72244\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations was tolled by the pendency of a petition for certiorari seeking review of a state postconviction proceeding.  See<em> Coates </em>v. <em>Byrd</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d 1225, 1227 (2000) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Accordingly, the District Court concluded that Lawrence had only one day to file a federal habeas application after the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1221 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  This limitations period is tolled while a state prisoner seeks postconviction relief in state court:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBased on this provision, the parties agree that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period was tolled from the filing of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s petition for state postconviction relief until the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate affirming the denial of that petition.  At issue here is whether the limitations period was also tolled during the pendency of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to this Court seeking review of the denial of state postconviction relief.  If it was tolled, Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas application was timely.  So we must decide whether, according to \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), an \xe2\x80\x9capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis pending\xe2\x80\x9d while this Court considers a certiorari petition.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Read naturally, the text of the statute must mean that the statute of limitations is tolled only while state courts review the application.  As we stated in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Saffold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U. S. 214</a>, 220 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), a state postconviction application \xe2\x80\x9cremains pending\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuntil the application has achieved final resolution through the State\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court is not a part of a \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s post-conviction procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  State review ends when the state courts have finally resolved an application for state postconviction relief.  After the State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court has issued its mandate or denied review, no other state avenues for relief remain open.  And an application for state postconviction review no longer exists.  All that remains is a separate certiorari petition pending before a <em>federal</em> court.  The application for state postconviction review is therefore not \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d after the state court\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction review\nis complete, and \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) does not toll the 1-year limitations period during the pendency of a petition for\ncertiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If an application for state postconviction review were \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d during the pendency of a certiorari petition in this Court, it is difficult to understand how a state prisoner could exhaust state postconviction remedies without filing a petition for certiorari.  Indeed, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion provision and tolling provision work together:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe tolling provision of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0Section 2244(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period and \xc2\xa72244(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s tolling provision, together with \xc2\xa72254(b)\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustion requirement, encourage litigants <em>first</em> to exhaust all state remedies and <em>then</em> to file their federal habeas petitions <em>as soon as possible</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

But \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) uses much different language from \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), referring to \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment became final by <em>the conclusion of direct review</em> or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  When interpreting similar language in \xc2\xa72255, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cdirect review\xe2\x80\x9d has long included review by this Court.  <em>Clay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/522/index.html">537 U. S. 522</a>, 527\xe2\x80\x93528 (2003).  Indeed, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted \xe2\x80\x98direct review\xe2\x80\x99 in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) to encompass review of a state conviction by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 528, n.\xc2\xa03 (collecting cases).  By contrast, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) refers exclusively to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>State</em> post-conviction or other collateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d language not easily interpreted to include participation by a federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A) refers to the \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking\xe2\x80\x9d direct review, which includes review by this Court under <em>Clay</em>.  By parity of reasoning, the \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking\xe2\x80\x9d review of a state postconviction judgment arguably would include the period for filing a certiorari petition before this Court.  However, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) makes no reference to the \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking\xe2\x80\x9d review of a state postconviction court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  Instead, it seeks to know when an application for \xe2\x80\x9cState \xe2\x80\xa6 review\xe2\x80\x9d is pending.  The linguistic difference is not insignificant: When the state courts have issued a final judgment on a state application, it is no longer pending even if a prisoner has additional time for seeking review of that judgment through a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A more analogous statutory provision is \xc2\xa72263(b)(2), which is part of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9copt-in\xe2\x80\x9d provisions for States that comply with specific requirements relating to the provision of postconviction counsel.  Under \xc2\xa72263, the limitations period is tolled \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72263(b)(2).  Lawrence concedes that under this language there would be no tolling for certiorari petitions seeking review of state postconviction applications.  And although he correctly notes that the language in \xc2\xa72263 differs from the language of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), it is clear that the language used in both sections provides that tolling hinges on the pendency of state review.  See \xc2\xa72263(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cuntil the final State court disposition of such petition\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review \xe2\x80\xa6 is pending\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear intent in \xc2\xa72263 to provide tolling for certiorari petitions on direct review but not for certiorari petitions following state postconviction review, it is not surprising that Congress would make the same distinction in \xc2\xa72244.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawrence also argues that our interpretation would result in awkward situations in which state prisoners have to file federal habeas applications while they have certiorari petitions from state postconviction proceedings pending before this Court.  But these situations will also arise under the express terms of \xc2\xa72263, and Lawrence admits that Congress intended that provision to preclude tolling for certiorari petitions.  Brief for Petitioner 22.  Because Congress was not concerned by this potential for awkwardness in \xc2\xa72263, there is no reason for us to construe the statute to avoid it in \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, our interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) results in few practical problems.  As Justice Stevens has noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court rarely grants review at this stage of the litigation even when the application for state collateral relief is supported by arguably meritorious federal constitutional claims,\xe2\x80\x9d choosing instead to wait for \xe2\x80\x9cfederal habeas proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/931/index.html">498 U. S. 931</a>, 932 (1990) (opinion concurring in denial of stay of execution).  Thus, the likelihood that the District Court will duplicate work or analysis that might be done by this Court if we granted certiorari to review the state postconviction proceeding is quite small.  And in any event, a district court concerned about duplicative work can stay the habeas application until this Court resolves the case or, more likely, denies the petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawrence argues that even greater anomalies result from our interpretation when the state court grants relief to a prisoner and the state petitions for certiorari.  In that hypothetical, Lawrence maintains that the prisoner would arguably lack standing to file a federal habeas application immediately after the state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment (because the state court granted him relief) but would later be time barred from filing a federal habeas application if we granted certiorari and the State prevailed.  Again, this particular procedural posture is extremely rare.  Even so, equitable tolling may be available, in light of the arguably extraordinary circumstances and the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s diligence.  See <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U. S. 408</a>, 418, and n.\xc2\xa08 (2005).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We cannot base our interpretation of the statute on an exceedingly rare inequity that Congress almost certainly was not contemplating and that may well be cured by equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the hypothetical problems identified by Lawrence, allowing the statute of limitations to be tolled by certiorari petitions would provide incentives for state prisoners to file certiorari petitions as a delay tactic.  By filing a petition for certiorari, the prisoner would push back \xc2\xa72254\xe2\x80\x99s deadline while we resolved the petition for certiorari.  This tolling rule would provide an incentive for prisoners to file certiorari petitions\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the merit of the claims asserted\xe2\x80\x94so that they receive additional time to file their habeas applications.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawrence also argues that equitable tolling applies to his otherwise untimely claims.  We have not decided whether \xc2\xa72244(d) allows for equitable tolling.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Because the parties agree that equitable tolling is available, we assume without deciding that it is.  To be entitled to equitable tolling, Lawrence must show \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\xe2\x80\x9d and prevented timely filing.  <em>Id.</em>, at 418.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lawrence makes several arguments in support of his contention that equitable tolling applies to his case.  First, he argues that legal confusion about whether AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is tolled by certiorari petitions justifies equitable tolling.  But at the time the limitations period expired in Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Eleventh Circuit and every other Circuit to address the issue agreed that the limitations period was not tolled by certiorari petitions.  See<em>, e.g., Coates</em>, 211 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 1227.  The settled state of\nthe law at the relevant time belies any claim to legal confusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Lawrence argues that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s mistake in miscalculating the limitations period entitles him to equitable tolling.  If credited, this argument would essentially equitably toll limitations periods for every person whose attorney missed a deadline.  Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel.  <em>E.g., Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 756\xe2\x80\x93757 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Third, Lawrence argues that his case presents special circumstances because the state courts appointed and supervised his counsel.  But a State\xe2\x80\x99s effort to assist prisoners in postconviction proceedings does not make the State accountable for a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s delay.  Lawrence has not alleged that the State prevented him from hiring his own attorney or from representing himself.  It would be perverse indeed if providing prisoners with postconviction counsel deprived States of the benefit of the AEDPA statute of limitations.  See, <em>e.g., Duncan</em>, 533 U. S., at 179 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe 1-year limitation period of \xc2\xa72244(d)(1) quite plainly serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, Lawrence argues that his mental incapacity justifies his reliance upon counsel and entitles him to equitable tolling.  Even assuming this argument could be legally credited, Lawrence has made no factual showing of mental incapacity.  In sum, Lawrence has fallen far short of showing \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to support equitable tolling.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals correctly determined that the filing of a petition for certiorari before this Court does not toll the statute of limitations under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  It also correctly declined to equitably toll the limitations period in the factual circumstances of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s case.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Lawrence contends that delays in Florida\xe2\x80\x99s program for appointing postconviction counsel and other issues outside of his control caused 298 days to pass before Florida appointed an attorney who took an active role in his postconviction case.  These facts have little relevance to our analysis.  Lawrence did not seek certiorari on the question whether these facts entitle him to equitable tolling.  Indeed, Lawrence was able to file his state postconviction petition on time in spite of these delays.  And before this Court, he argues that his attorney mistakenly missed the federal habeas deadline, not that he lacked adequate time to file a federal habeas application.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We have previously held that the word \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d modifies both the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpost-conviction\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

When we are asked to review a state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of habeas relief, we consider an application for that relief\xe2\x80\x94not an application for federal habeas relief.  Until we have disposed of the petition for certiorari, the application remains live as one for state postconviction relief; it is not transformed into a federal application simply because the state-court applicant petitions for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore hold that 28 U.

That provision can and should be read to continue statutory tolling until this Court has either decided or denied a petition for certiorari addressed to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of an application for postconviction relief.

The majority\xe2\x80\x99s contrary reading of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) cuts short the tolling period before this Court has had an opportunity to consider an application for state postconviction relief.

The first of these, \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), tells us when AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations begins to run; it states that the trigger is the \xe2\x80\x9cthe date on which the judgment [of conviction] became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress thus explicitly ordered that the clock starts, following a state conviction, when the time to file a petition for certiorari expires or, if a petition is filed, when it is decided or denied.

In fact, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) refers to an \xe2\x80\x9c<em>application</em> for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  And it tolls the limitation period while the application is \xe2\x80\x9cpending,\xe2\x80\x9d not while it is \xe2\x80\x9cpending <em>in State court</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Just as a judgment of conviction is not \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d until we have declined review or decided the case on the merits, see <em>Clay</em>, 537 U. S., at 527\xe2\x80\x93530 (interpreting \xc2\xa72255),<em> </em>so an application for state habeas relief is sensibly understood to remain \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d until we have disposed of the case.  It is a fundamental characteristic of our federal system that this Court has appellate jurisdiction over state-court decisions implicating federal law or the Constitution.  Until we have exercised that jurisdiction or declined to do so the case is not finally decided.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1, and n.\xc2\xa01.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its opposing view, the majority emphasizes that \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) does not include the words \xe2\x80\x9ctime for seeking \xe2\x80\xa6 review,\xe2\x80\x9d words included in \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  This difference in phrasing, the majority reasons, indicates that Congress intended to cut off tolling as soon as the highest state court renders its judgment, well before a petition for review is filed in this Court.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]<font b="1">  But the wording of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), I am persuaded, is more appropriately contrasted with \xc2\xa72263(b)(2), which prescribes a parallel tolling rule for \xe2\x80\x9copt-in\xe2\x80\x9d capital cases.  Section 2263(b)(2), unlike the provision at issue here, leaves no doubt that Congress intended to exclude from the tolling period the time for filing a petition for certiorari.  It provides that the statute of limitations tolls \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed <em>until the final State court disposition of such petition</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Section 2263(b)(2) thus demonstrates that when Congress wanted to cut off tolling immediately upon the final state court decision\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, to exclude this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review from the tolling period\xe2\x80\x94it simply said so.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One can understand why Congress might have chosen an uncommon rule for the special capital cases covered by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72261\xe2\x80\x932263, a separate chapter of the statute.  By terminating tolling upon final state-court disposition, rather than extending the period during the pendency of a certiorari petition, Congress eliminated one source of delay in implementing the death penalty.  But Congress provided that the shortened tolling period would apply only to petitions brought by prisoners in States that have established a mechanism for providing counsel in postconviction proceedings.  See \xc2\xa72261.  An attorney, of course, is better equipped than a <em>pro se </em>petitioner to clear procedural hurdles, including shortened timelines.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Given the exceptional character of the opt-in category, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) is more appropriately<font b="1"> aligned with \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), the provision immediately preceding it, than with \xc2\xa72263(b)(2).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority maintains that if an application for state postconviction review were considered to be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d while a certiorari petition remained before this Court, then a state prisoner could not exhaust state postconviction remedies without filing a petition for certiorari.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But exhaustion and tolling serve discrete functions and need not be synchronized.  The former is a prerequisite to filing for habeas relief in federal court.  Exhaustion promotes principles of comity and federalism by giving state courts the first opportunity to adjudicate claims of state prisoners; that doctrine, however, does not necessitate this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  See <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/index.html">526 U. S. 838</a>, 844 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9cComity \xe2\x80\xa6 dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a state court conviction violates federal law, the state courts should have the first opportunity to review this claim and provide any necessary relief.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Tolling, in contrast, concerns the time within which a procedural move must be made, not the issues that must be raised before a particular tribunal.  And while one purpose of tolling is to allow adequate time for exhaustion, that is not the sole objective.  Tolling in the context here involved also protects a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pursue his or her federal claims in a federal forum and avoids simultaneous litigation in more than one court\xe2\x80\x94objectives undercut by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  See <em>infra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a> (2001), does not suggest a different result.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 4.  In <em>Duncan</em>,<em> </em>we held that a <em>federal</em> habeas petition does not toll \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period because \xe2\x80\x9can application for federal habeas corpus review is not an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review within the meaning of 28 U.

A petitioner denied relief by a State\xe2\x80\x99s highest court will now have to file, contemporaneously, a petition for certiorari in this Court and a habeas petition in federal district court.  Only by expeditiously filing for federal habeas relief will a prisoner ensure that the limitation period does not run before we have disposed of his or her petition for certiorari.  Protective petitions will be essential, too, when we grant review of a state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on a state habeas petition, for many months can elapse between the date we agree to hear a case and the date we issue an opinion.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Consequently, the same claims will be pending in two courts at once, and the duplication will occasion administrative problems; for example, no decision, law, or rule tells us in which court the record in the case should be lodged.  See this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 12, \xc2\xb67 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe clerk of the court having possession of the record shall keep it until notified by the Clerk of this Court to certify and transmit it.\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no indication that Congress intended to burden the court system or litigants with such premature filings.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The anticipatory filing in a federal district court will be all the more anomalous when a habeas petitioner prevails in state court and the State petitions for certiorari.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it appears, the petitioner will be obliged to file a protective petition in federal court even though he gained relief from the state tribunal.  Lawrence questions whether the federal courts would even have jurisdiction over such a bizarre petition.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7. <em> </em>While I incline to the view that a prisoner in such a position would have standing, Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s concerns are at least plausible and raise the specter of a habeas petitioner prevailing in state court, yet losing the right to pursue constitutional claims in federal court altogether: By the time we have ruled on the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the statute of limitations likely would have run.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though recognizing this problem, the majority suggests that equitable tolling may provide a solution.  But in the next breath, the majority hastens to clarify that the Court does <em>not </em>hold that equitable tolling is available under AEDPA.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, and n.\xc2\xa03.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, no similar problems, practical or jurisdictional, would result from a determination that an application for state postconviction review remains \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d while a petition for certiorari from the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is before this Court.  Nor would such a determination create an untoward opportunity for abuse of the writ.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that prisoners would have an incentive to petition for certiorari as a delay tactic has no basis in reality in the mine run of cases.  Most prisoners want to be released from custody as soon as possible, not to prolong their incarceration.  They are therefore interested in the expeditious resolution of their claims.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As earlier indicated, see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, a petitioner could achieve the equivalent of tolling by filing a protective petition in federal court and seeking a stay while a certiorari petition is pending.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7; cf. <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/269/index.html">544 U.

In that event, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does nothing to promote the finality of state-court determinations or the expeditious resolution of claims.  Rather, it imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on federal district judges who must determine whether to grant a requested stay, and it sets a trap for those <em>pro se </em>litigants unaware of the need to file duplicative petitions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading is neither compelled by the text of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) nor practically sound.  By cutting off tolling before this Court has had an opportunity to consider a pending petition for certiorari, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will unnecessarily encumber the federal courts with anticipatory filings and deprive unwitting litigants of the opportunity to pursue their constitutional claims\xe2\x80\x94all without furthering the purposes of AEDPA.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, I would hold that petitioner Lawrence qualifies for statutory tolling under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), and would therefore reverse the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It is unclear just what the majority thinks we are considering when we address a state habeas petition on certiorari.

Under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s standard of review, a petitioner who has suffered a violation of a constitutional right will nonetheless fail on federal habeas unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  Even if rare, the importance of our review of state habeas proceedings is evident.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Deck</em>, 544 U. S., at 624 (granting review of state habeas petition and holding that the Constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during guilt and penalty phase unless justified by an essential state interest); <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 578 (2005) (granting review of state habeas petition and holding that execution of individuals under age of 18 is prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Satisfied that statutory tolling covers this case, I do not address petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument for equitable tolling.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Though capital petitioners may be aided by delay, they are a small minority of all petitioners.  In this case, moreover, there is no indication that Lawrence was intentionally dilatory.
