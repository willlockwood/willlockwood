S. 152</a></p><p> commenced this action in 1978 in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama as the assignee of its members\' claims.  Respondents are 15 pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama, and the Cooper Green Hospital Pharmacy.  The University operates a medical center, including hospitals, and a medical school.  Located in the University\'s medical center are two pharmacies.  Cooper Green Hospital is a county hospital, existing as a public corporation under Alabama law.</p>\n<p>The complaint seeks treble damages and injunctive relief under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 737, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 15 and 26, for alleged violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2(a) and (f) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (Act), 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13(a) and (f).  Petitioner contends that the respondent manufacturers violated \xc2\xa7 2(a) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] by selling their products to the University\'s two pharmacies and to Cooper Green Hospital Pharmacy at prices lower than those charged petitioner\'s members for like products.  Petitioner alleges that the respondent hospital pharmacies knowingly induced such lower prices in violation of \xc2\xa7 2(f) [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and sold the drugs to the general public in direct competition with privately owned pharmacies.  Petitioner </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 460 U. S. 153</a></p><p> also alleges that the price discrimination is not exempted from the proscriptions of the Act by 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13c. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that state purchases [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] are exempt as a matter of law from the sanctions of \xc2\xa7 2.  In granting respondents\' motions, the District Court expressly accepted as true the allegations that local retail pharmacies had been injured by the challenged price discrimination and that at least some of the state purchases were not exempt under \xc2\xa7 13c.  656 F.2d 92, 98 (CA5 1981) (reprinting District Court\'s opinion as Appendix).  The District Court held that</p>\n<p>"governmental purchases are, without regard to 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13c, beyond the intended reach of the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act, at least with respect to purchases for hospitals and other traditional governmental purposes."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 102.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in a divided per curiam decision, affirmed "on the basis of the district court\'s Memorandum of Opinion."  <em>Id.</em> at 93. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve this important question of federal law.  455 U.S. 999 (1982).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The issue here is narrow.  We are not concerned with sales to the Federal Government, nor with state purchases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="154">Page 460 U. S. 154</a></p><p> for <em>use</em> in traditional governmental functions. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Rather, the issue before us is limited to state purchases for the purpose of competing against private enterprise -- with the advantage of discriminatory prices -- in the retail market. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The courts below held, and respondents contend, that the Act exempts all state purchases.  Assuming, without deciding, that Congress did not intend the Act to apply to state purchases for consumption in traditional governmental functions, and that such purchases are therefore exempt, we conclude that the exemption does not apply where a State has chosen to compete in the private retail market.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Robinson-Patman Act, by its terms, does not exempt state purchases.  The only express exemption is that for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 460 U. S. 155</a></p><p> nonprofit institutions contained in 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13c. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Moreover, as the courts below conceded, "[t]he statutory language -- <em>persons\' and `purchasers\' -- is sufficiently broad to cover governmental bodies.  15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 12, 13(a, f)."  656 F.2d at 99. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  This concession was compelled by several of this Court\'s decisions. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html">435 U.

S. 395</a></span> (1978), for example, we stated without qualification that "the definition of `person\' or `persons\' embraces both cities and States.\'" [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 460 U. S. 156</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents would distinguish <em>City of Lafayette</em> from the case before us because it involved the Sherman Act, rather than the Robinson-Patman Act. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Such a distinction ignores the specific reference to the Robinson-Patman Act in our discussion of the all-inclusive nature of the term "person."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#397">435 U. S. 397</a></span>, n. 14.  We do not perceive any reason to construe the word "person" in that Act any differently than we have in the Clayton Act, which it amends, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and it is undisputed that the Clayton Act applies to States.  <em>See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html">405 U.

[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In sum, the plain language </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 460 U. S. 157</a></p><p> of the Act strongly suggests that there is no exemption for state purchases to compete with private enterprise.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The plain language of the Act is controlling unless a different legislative intent is apparent from the purpose and history of the Act.  An examination of the legislative purpose and history here reveals no such contrary intention.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Our cases have been explicit in stating the purposes of the antitrust laws, including the Robinson-Patman Act.  On numerous occasions, this Court has affirmed the comprehensive coverage of the antitrust laws, and has recognized that these laws represent</p>\n<p>"a carefully studied attempt to bring within [them] every person engaged in business whose activities might restrain or monopolize commercial intercourse among the states."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

Virginia State Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/773/case.html">421 U.

The Court emphasized the purposes and scope of the antitrust laws:</p>\n<p>"[T]he economic choices made by public corporations . . . designed as they are to assure maximum benefits for the community constituency, are not inherently more likely to comport with the broader interests of national economic wellbeing than are those of private corporations acting in furtherance of the interests of the organization and its shareholders."</p>\n<p>436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/371/case.html#403">436 U.

There is nothing whatever in the Senate or House Committee Reports, or in the floor debates, focusing on the issue. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Some Members of Congress were aware of the possibility that the Act would </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 460 U. S. 160</a></p><p> apply to governmental purchases.  Most Members, however, were concerned not with state purchases, but with possible limitations on the Federal Government.  The most relevant legislative history is the testimony of the Act\'s principal draftsman, H. B. Teegarden, before the House Judiciary Committee. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Although the testimony is ambiguous on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="161">Page 460 U. S. 161</a></p><p> application of the Act to state purchases for consumption, one conclusion is certain:  Teegarden expressly stated that the Act would apply to the purchases of municipal hospitals in at least some circumstances. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Thus, his comments directly contradict the exemption found by the courts below for all such purchasing. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  In the absence of any other relevant evidence, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="162">Page 460 U.

We turn therefore to these subsequent events. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 460 U. S. 164</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents cite the hearings on the Robinson-Patman Act held in the late 1960\'s. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Testimony before the House Subcommittee investigating practices in the pharmaceutical industry indicated that the Act did not cover price discrimination in favor of state hospitals, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Paul Dixon disclaimed any authority over transactions involving state health care programs. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  It </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 460 U.

[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Other statements expressed little more than informed, interested opinions on the issue presented, and are not entitled to the consideration appropriate for the constructions given contemporaneously with the Act\'s passage. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#159">460 U.

The Subcommittee found that the difference between drug prices for retailers and government customers "is extremely substantial," and</p>\n<p>"not always fully explainable by either cost justifiable quantity discounts, economies of scale, or other factors inherent in bulk distribution."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No.1983, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 77 (1968).  In the next conclusion, it stated that "[n]umerous acts and policies of individual manufacturers seem . . . violative of the Robinson-Patman </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 460 U. S. 166</a></p><p> Act. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, it is quite possible that the Subcommittee considered some state purchasing at discriminatory prices -- about which it had heard testimony -- to be unlawful.  The Subcommittee Report did include the awkwardly worded statement:</p>\n<p>"There is no basis apparent . . . why the mandate of the Robinson-Patman Act should not be applied to discriminatory drug sales favoring nongovernmental institutional purchasers, profit or nonprofit, to the extent there is prescription drug competition at the retail level with disfavored retail druggists."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 79.  This unexceptional opinion, however, simply says that <em>private</em> institutional purchases may not facilitate unfair retail competition through sales at discriminatory prices.  The Subcommittee said nothing expressly about the unfair competition at issue in this case. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents also argue that, without exception, courts considering the Act\'s coverage have concluded that it does not apply to government purchasers.  They insist that no court has imposed liability upon a seller or buyer, under either \xc2\xa7 2(a) or \xc2\xa7 2(f), when the discriminatory price involved a sale to a State, city, or county.  <em>See</em> Brief for Respondent Board of Trustees 31-32.  There are serious infirmities in these broad assertions:  (i) this Court has never held nor suggested that there is an exemption for state purchases; [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] (ii) the number of judicial decisions even <em>considering</em> the Act\'s application </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 460 U. S. 167</a></p><p> to purchases by state agencies is relatively small; [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] (iii) respondents cite no Court of Appeals decision that has expressly adopted their interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2 before the decision below; (iv) some of the District Court cases upon which respondents rely are simply inapposite; [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>] (V) it is not clear that any published District Court opinion has relied solely on a state purchase exemption to dismiss a Robinson-Patman Act claim alleging injury as a result of government competition in the private market; [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] and (vi) there are several cases that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 460 U. S. 168</a></p><p> suggest that the Robinson-Patman Act is applicable to state purchases for resale purposes. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  This judicial track record is in no sense comparable to the unbroken chain of judicial decisions upon which this Court previously has relied for ascertaining a construction of the antitrust laws that Congress, over a long period of time, has chosen to preserve.  <em>See</em> cases cited,  <a href="#F27" name="T27">n</a> 27, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Respondents also seek support in the interpretations of various commentators and executive officials.  But the most authoritative of these sources indicate that the question presented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 460 U.

[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]  Thus, Congress cannot be said to have left untouched a universally held interpretation of the Act. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, it is clear that post-enactment developments -- whether legislative, judicial, or in commentary -- rarely have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 460 U.

There is simply no unambiguous evidence of congressional intent to exempt purchases by a State for the purpose of competing in the private retail market with a price advantage. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Robinson-Patman Act has been widely criticized, both for its effects and for the policies that it seeks to promote.

There is no risk, however, of a constitutional issue arising from the application of the Act in this case:  the retail sale of pharmaceutical drugs is not "indisputably" an attribute of state sovereignty.  <em>See Hodel v.

If the Tenth Amendment protects certain state purchases from the Act\'s limitations, such as for consumption in traditional governmental functions, those purchases must be protected on a case-by-case basis.  <em>Cf.

Volume purchasing permits any large, relatively efficient, retail organization to pass on cost savings to consumers, and, to that extent, consumers benefit merely from economy of scale.  But to the extent that lower prices are attributable to lower overhead, resulting from federal grants, state subsidies, free public services, and freedom from taxation, state agencies merely redistribute the burden of costs from the actual consumers to the citizens at large.  An exemption from the Robinson-Patman Act could give state agencies a significant <em>additional</em> advantage in certain commercial markets, perhaps enough to eliminate marginal or small private competitors.  Consumers, as citizens, ultimately will pay for the full costs of the drugs sold by the state agencies involved in this case.  Because there is no reason to assume that such agencies will provide retail distribution more efficiently than private retail pharmacists, consumers will suffer to the extent that state retail activities eliminate more efficient, private retail distribution systems.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s dissenting opinion repeatedly emphasizes that Congress, in 1936, did not focus specifically on the issue presented here.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#180">460 U.

S. 171</a></span>.  He joins in JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s dissent, however, on the basis of a novel theory:  that state and local agencies may never be in "competition" with private parties within the meaning of the Act.  <em>See ibid.</em>  This is an economic fiction:  if in fact a State participates in the private retail pharmaceutical market, it competes with the private participants.  JUSTICE STEVENS relies on one statement by witness Teegarden in the 1935 House Hearings, but attaches no significance to a further statement by the same witness:</p>\n<p>"In the final analysis, it would depend upon <em>numerous questions of fact in a particular case.</em>  If the two hospitals are <em>in competition</em> with each other, I should say then that the fact that one is operated by the city does not save it from the bill."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 1935 Hearings at 209 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>Teegarden subsequently submitted a written brief to the House Committee.  He first rejected outright the desirability of <em>any</em> exemptions.  <em>See id.</em> at 249.  He then posed the question whether "the bill [would] prevent competitive bidding on Governmental purchases below trade price levels."  He stated that</p>\n<p>"[t]he answer is found in the principle of statutory construction that a statute will not be construed to limit or restrict in any way the rights, prerogatives, or privileges of the sovereign unless it so expressly provides -- a principle inherited by American jurisprudence from the common law. . . ."</p>\n<p>But he also noted that "requiring a showing of effect upon competition . . . will further preclude any possibility of the bill affecting the Government."  <em>Id.</em> at 250.</p>\n<p>All the cases Teegarden cited suggest that this sovereign exception rule of statutory construction simply means that a government, when <em>it</em> passes a law, gives up only what it expressly surrenders.  While the Robinson-Patman Act was pending before Congress, the Court stated that it could</p>\n<p>"perceive no reason for extending [the presumption against binding the sovereign by its own statute] so as to exempt a business carried on by a state from the otherwise applicable provisions of an act of Congress, all-embracing in scope and national in its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by state as by individual action."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html">297 U. S. 175</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/175/case.html#186">297 U. S. 186</a></span> (1936).  <em>See California v.

In the context of the Robinson-Patman Act, the rule of statutory construction on which Teegarden relied supports, at the most, an exemption for the <em>Federal</em> Government\'s purchases.  The existence of such an exemption is not before us.  <em>Cf. United States v. Cooper Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html">312 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html#604">312 U. S. 604</a></span>-605 (1941) (United States not a "person" under the Sherman Act for purposes of suing for treble damages).  Moreover, Teegarden clearly assumed that governmental purchasing would not compete with private purchasing.  That assumption, however, is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Six months after the Act was passed, the Attorney General of the United States responded to an inquiry from the Secretary of War regarding the Act\'s application "to government contracts for supplies."  38 Op.Atty.Gen. 539 (1936).  In ruling that such contracts are outside the Act, the Attorney General explained:</p>\n<p>"[S]tatutes regulating rates, charges, etc., in matters affecting commerce do not ordinarily apply to the Government unless it is expressly so provided; and it does not seem to have been the policy of the Congress to make such statutes applicable to the Government. . . ."</p>\n<p>"The [Robinson-Patman Act] merely amended the [Clayton Act] and, in so far as I am aware, the latter Act has not been regarded heretofore as applicable to Government contracts."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 540.  Later in the letter, the Attorney General clarified that his reference was to "the Federal Government," <em>ibid.,</em> and gave other reasons</p>\n<p>"for avoiding a construction that would make the statute applicable to the Government in violation of the apparent policy of the Congress in such matters,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 541.  The Attorney General expressly relied upon <em>Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/275/415/case.html">275 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/275/415/case.html#425">275 U. S. 425</a></span> (1928), in which the Court upheld the granting of favorable telegraph rates to a <em>federal</em> corporation that competed with private enterprise.</p>\n<p>The Attorney General\'s opinion says nothing about the Act\'s applicability to state agencies.  Indeed, in the following year, the Attorney General of California expressly concluded that state purchases were within the Act\'s proscriptions.  <em>See</em> 1932-1939 Trade Cases \xef\xbf\xbd 55, 156, pp. 415-416 (1937).  Two other early State Attorney General opinions simply do not consider whether the Act applies to state purchases for <em>retail</em> sales.  <em>See</em> Opinion of Attorney General of Minnesota, 1932-1939 Trade Cases \xef\xbf\xbd 55, 157, p. 416 (1937); 26 Wis. Op.Atty.Gen. 142 (1937).</p>\n<p>Representative Patman "presumed that the [United States] Attorney General\'s reasons may be also applied to municipal and public institutions."  W. Patman, The Robinson-Patman Act 168 (1938).  <em>See also</em> W. Patman, Complete Guide to the Robinson-Patman Act 30 (1963) (interpreting Attorney General\'s opinion as exempting all governmental purchases).  His interpretation is entitled to some weight, but he appears only to be interpreting -- or erroneously extending -- the Attorney General\'s opinion and reasoning.  Representative Patman\'s personal intentions probably are better reflected in his introduction in 1951 and 1953 of bills to amend the Act to define "purchaser" to include "the United States, any State or any political subdivision thereof."  H.R. 4452, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. (1951); H.R. 3377, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. (1953).  There is no legislative history on these bills, but it is arguable that he believed that the original intent needed to be stated expressly to negate his reading of the Attorney General\'s contrary construction of the Act.  In any case, Congress\' failure to pass these bills may be attributable to a reluctance to subject <em>federal</em> purchases to the Act.  For example, in 1955, 1957, 1959, and 1961, Representative Keogh also unsuccessfully introduced bills to extend the Act to federal purchases only <em>for resale.</em> <em>See</em> H.R. 430, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961); H.R. 155, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); H.R. 722, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957); H.R. 5213, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. (1955).</p>\n<p>It bears repeating, moreover, that none of these views -- including Representative Patman\'s -- focuses on the state purchases alleged here:  purchases to gain competitive advantage in the private market, rather than purchases for use in traditional governmental functions.  For the Department of Justice\'s most recent statements regarding an exemption or immunity for state enterprises, <em>see</em> <a href="#F37" name="T37">n</a> 37, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The most important relevant event in the Robinson-Patman Act\'s postenactment history is the amendment in 1938 excluding eleemosynary institutions, 52 Stat. 446, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13c.  Whether the existence of an exemption in \xc2\xa7 13c supports an exemption for certain state purchases depends upon whether \xc2\xa7 13c is interpreted to apply to state agencies that perform the functions listed.  That is a substantial issue in its own right.  <em>Compare</em> H.R.Rep.

It is more accurate to say that this was an unsettled question of federal law that demanded this Court\'s attention.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T39" name="F39">Footnote 39</a>]</p>\n<p>Under our interpretation, the Act\'s benefits would accrue, precisely as intended, to the benefit of small, private retailers.  <em>See</em> 1935 Hearings, at 261 (Teegarden recommending passage "for the protection of private rights").</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>While I join JUSTICE O\'CONNOR\'s dissenting opinion, I believe an additional comment on the text of the Robinson-Patman Act may help to explain my vote.  For purposes of interpreting that statute, I think that federal, state, and local agencies are "purchasers," but that such governmental agencies are not engaged in "competition" with private parties even when they resell purchased goods to consumers who might otherwise have patronized a private retailer.  Both before and after the 1936 statute amended \xc2\xa7 2 of the Clayton Act, the requirement of proving an adverse effect on "competition" played an important part in limiting the coverage of the statute.</p>\n<p>It is universally agreed that federal purchases are not covered by the Act.  Even though it has always been obvious that primary line competition might be injured by discriminatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 460 U. S. 172</a></p><p> prices on sales to the Federal Government, and also that goods sold to military post exchanges would normally be resold at a substantial discount, no one in the 1936 legislative deliberations questioned the inapplicability of the Act to these sales.  The explanation, in my opinion, does not rest on the sovereign status of the Federal Government, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html">*</a></span> but rather on the assumption embodied in the Act that federal agencies do not compete with nongovernmental entities.</p>\n<p>Mr. Teegarden, the lobbyist, made this assumption clear in his statement at the 1935 House hearings, quoted in part by the opinion of the Court.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#160">460 U. S. 160</a></span>-161, n.19:</p>\n<p>"Mr. LLOYD:  Would this bill, in your judgment, prevent the granting of discounts to the United States Government?"</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"For instance, the Government gets huge discounts.  Take that electric fan, for instance.  You go to the ordinary store and the list price is $35.  The Procurement Division procures them delivered, one at a time, for $13.18.  Now, would that discount be barred by this bill?"</p>\n<p>"Mr. TEEGARDEN:  I do not see why it should. . . . "</p>\n<p>"Aside from that, my answer would be this:  the Federal Government is not in competition with other buyers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="173">Page 460 U. S. 173</a></p><p> from these concerns.  Therefore a discrimination -- it is so applied universally in interstate commerce law, in the railroad law -- to have a discrimination, there must be a relative position between the parties to the discrimination which constitutes an injury to one as against the other.  I think the answer is to be found in that."</p>\n<p>"In other words, if seller A makes a price to a retailer in New York and a different price to a retailer in San Francisco, all other things aside, no case of discrimination could be predicated there, because the two are not in the same sphere at all."</p>\n<p>"The Federal Government is saved by the same distinction, not of location but of function.  They are not in competition with anyone else who would buy."</p>\n<p>Hearings on H.R. 8442 <em>et al.</em> before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 208-209 (1935).</p>\n<p>I would interpret the "distinction, not of location but of function" somewhat more broadly than does the majority.  It is not merely a question of whether government agencies do or do not resell the goods they have purchased.  Even when they resell items to the public, governmental entities do not engage in competition with private retailers in the same sense that chainstores compete with independent retailers.  Most importantly, their activities are seldom affected by a profitmaking motivation; rather, they are undertaken in connection with the provision of services to the public.  Further, their merchandising and price-setting decisions take a different set of factors into account.  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#158">460 U. S. 158</a></span>, n. 17, they need not include a profit component, their overhead may be subsidized, and they may be exempt from state or federal taxation.  In short, governmental agencies are in an entirely different category of market participants.</p>\n<p>I am convinced that the same analysis applies to purchases and resales by state and local agencies.  I do not believe that a municipal hospital that operates a pharmacy is any more engaged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="174">Page 460 U. S. 174</a></p><p> in competition with a retail druggist than a military post exchange is engaged in competition with a retail grocer or a retail clothing store.  To be sure, this analysis is not entirely consistent with the conclusion implied by Mr. Teegarden\'s somewhat equivocal answer to Congressman Hancock.  Although he did not say that purchases by a city hospital would be covered by the bill, he did state that, "<em>[i]f the two hospitals are in competition with each other,</em>" the fact that one was operated by the city would not save it from the bill.  But he went on to stress:  "<em>If they are not in competition with each other, then they are in a different sphere.</em>"  Hearings on H.R. 8442, <em>supra,</em> at 209 (emphasis added).  In my view, if not in Mr. Teegarden\'s, the differences between a city hospital and a private hospital justify the conclusion that, for purposes of construing this statute, they should not be considered in competition with each other.</p>\n<p>I therefore would hold as a matter of law that neither purchases nor sales by governmental agencies -- federal, state, or local -- constitute "competition" with private persons to which the statute has any application.  The Act has no impact on any governmental agency\'s ability to provide hospital and related services to its constituents.  For the reasons JUSTICE O\'CONNOR has set forth in greater detail, I believe such a holding more accurately reflects the understanding of the Congress that enacted the statute and the lawyers and businessmen who have lived with the statute on a day-to-day basis for almost half a century.</p>\n<p>* When Mr. Teegarden responded to specific written questions about the Act, he gave two reasons why the bill would not prevent competitive bidding on government purchases below trade price levels.  First, he stated that a statute would not be construed to restrict the rights, prerogatives, or privileges of the sovereign unless it expressly so provided.  This reason would apply only to the Federal Government, as the Court\'s opinion points out.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#159">460 U. S. 159</a></span>-161, nn. 18, 19.  In addition, however, Mr. Teegarden gave a reason that applies to governmental entities at state and local levels as well.</p>\n<p>"The further insertion of the clause proposed under topic 4 below, requiring a showing of effect upon competition, will further preclude any possibility of the bill\'s affecting the Government."</p>\n<p>Hearings on H.R. 8442 <em>et al.</em> before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 250 (1935).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The issue that confronts the Court is one of statutory construction:  whether the Robinson-Patman Act covers purchases of commodities by state and local governments for resale in competition with private retailers. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  The Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 460 U. S. 175</a></p><p> task, therefore, is to discern the intent of the 1936 Congress which enacted the Robinson-Patman Act.  I do not agree with the majority that this issue can be resolved by reference to cases under the Sherman Act or other statutes, or by reliance on the broad remedial purposes of the antitrust laws generally.  The 1936 Congress simply did not focus on this issue.  The business and legal communities have assumed for the past four decades that such purchases are not covered.  For these reasons, as explained more fully below, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority relies extensively on the interpretation this Court has given to the term "person" under the Sherman Act and other statutes as a guide to whether the terms "person" and "purchasers," as used in \xc2\xa7 2 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (Act), 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 13, include state and local governmental entities.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#155">460 U. S. 155</a></span>-156.  In my view, such reliance is misplaced.  The question of the Robinson-Patman Act\'s treatment of governmental purchases requires an independent examination of the legislative history of that Act to ascertain congressional intent. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Indeed, the cases cited by the majority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="176">Page 460 U. S. 176</a></p><p> emphasize that the key question regarding coverage or noncoverage of governmental entities is the intent of Congress <em>in enacting the statute in question.</em> [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Resolution of the statutory construction question cannot be made to depend upon the abstract assertion that the term "person" is broad enough to embrace States and municipalities. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  For these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="177">Page 460 U. S. 177</a></p><p> reasons, the mere fact that, in <em>City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html">435 U. S. 389</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/389/case.html#397">435 U. S. 397</a></span>, n. 14 (1978), a Sherman Act case, the Court referred to the Robinson-Patman Act in its discussion of the breadth of the term "person" cannot resolve the question now before us.</p>\n<p>Further, the majority opinion propounds a misleading syllogism when it (1) suggests that the term "person" in the Clayton and Robinson-Patman Acts should be construed similarly, (2) cites <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html">405 U. S. 251</a></span> (1972), for the proposition that the Clayton Act applies to States, and (3) then opines that the terms "person" and "purchasers" under \xc2\xa7 2 therefore should be construed to include state purchases.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#155">460 U. S. 155</a></span>-156.  Because, as the majority observes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#156">460 U. S. 156</a></span>, n. 13, the definitional section of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 12, was intended to apply to the Robinson-Patman Act, I do not dispute the first proposition.  However, <em>Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.</em> stated only that a State is a "person" for purposes of bringing a treble damages action under \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act.  405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/251/case.html#261">405 U. S. 261</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Conspicuously absent from the majority\'s discussion is any authority holding that States or local governments are persons for purposes of exposure to <em>liability</em> as purchasers under the provisions of the Clayton Act. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Although Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="178">Page 460 U. S. 178</a></p><p> might now decide that the purchasing activities of States and local governments <em>should</em> be subject to the limitations imposed by \xc2\xa7 2, that is a policy judgment appropriately left to legislative determination.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Nor do I find persuasive the majority\'s invocation of presumptions regarding the liberal construction and broad remedial purposes of the antitrust laws generally.  Without derogating the usefulness of those principles or suggesting that they should never play a role in the Robinson-Patman context, one may nevertheless candidly acknowledge that the Court also has identified a certain tension between the Robinson-Patman Act, on the one hand, and the Sherman Act and other antitrust statutes, on the other.  The Court frequently has recognized that strict enforcement of the anti-price-discrimination provisions of the former may lead to price rigidity and uniformity in direct conflict with the goals of the latter.  <em>See, e.g., Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/69/case.html">440 U. S. 69</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/69/case.html#80">440 U.

S. 179</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the very least, this recognition raises doubts that the Court should liberally construe the Robinson-Patman Act in favor of broader coverage.  Those doubts are enhanced by the fact that Congress\' principal aim in enacting the Robinson-Patman Act was to protect small retailers from the competitive injury suffered at the hands of large chain stores. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  It is consistent with that intent for Congress also to have displayed special solicitude for the well-established, below-trade price-buying practices of governmental institutions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As the majority documents, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#160">460 U. S. 160</a></span>, n.19, the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act clearly indicates that Congress envisioned <em>some</em> sort of immunity for governmental bodies. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  The question before the Court is the extent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 460 U. S. 180</a></p><p> of that immunity -- in particular, whether the purchase of goods by state and local governments for resale in competition with private retailers is within the intended scope of the Robinson-Patman Act.  As the majority acknowledges, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#159">460 U. S. 159</a></span>, the 1936 Congress that enacted the Robinson-Patman Act did not focus on the precise issue before the Court.  Notwithstanding this admission, the majority announces the surprising conclusion that "[t]o create an exemption here <em>clearly</em> would be contrary to the intent of Congress."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#171">460 U. S. 171</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority is correct in stating that it is not the business of this Court to engage in "<em>policymaking in the field of antitrust legislation\'" in order to fill gaps where Congress has not clearly expressed its intent.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#170">460 U. S. 170</a></span> (quoting <em>United States v. Cooper Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html">312 U. S. 600</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/600/case.html#606">312 U. S. 606</a></span> (1941)).  It is precisely because I concur in that admonition that I would refrain from attributing to Congress an intent to cover the state and local governmental purchases in question here. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 460 U. S. 181</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In attempting to supply the unexpressed intent of Congress, the majority fails to offer satisfactory guidelines for determining the scope of the Act\'s coverage of governmental agencies. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The majority assumes, "without deciding, that Congress did not intend the Act to apply to state purchases for consumption in traditional governmental functions," and suggests that state purchases of pharmaceuticals for the purpose of resale to indigent citizens may not expose the State to antitrust liability.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#154">460 U. S. 154</a></span>, and n. 7.</p>\n<p>The majority\'s assumption, however, is inconsistent with the principles of statutory construction upon which it purports to rely.  If, absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, the plain language of the statute controls, then, by the majority\'s own assertions, one would have to conclude that even purchases for the State\'s own use or for resale to indigents would fall within the Act\'s proscriptions.  For, as the majority remarks, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#155">460 U. S. 155</a></span>, the terms "person" and "purchasers" are broad enough to include governmental entities, and the legislative history is "ambiguous on the application of the Act to state purchases for consumption. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#160">460 U. S. 160</a></span>-161.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent the majority implies that a State\'s coverage or noncoverage under the Act turns on the distinction between purchases for resale and purchases for consumption, [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] that distinction is inconsistent with the competition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 460 U. S. 182</a></p><p> rationale elsewhere suggested, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#170">460 U. S. 170</a></span>, to underlie the prohibitions of \xc2\xa7 2(a).  For example, a state university hospital might limit the use of its pharmacy to its own faculty and staff, thereby falling within the "for their own use" exception. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Nevertheless, the university pharmacy may be inflicting competitive injury on private pharmacies that the university\'s faculty and staff might otherwise patronize. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  Thus, the majority\'s conflicting suggestions leave in doubt what principle -- the presence of functional competition or the consumption/resale dichotomy -- guides the determination whether a state or local government\'s purchases fall within the Act\'s proscriptions.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of a legislative history that even the majority concedes does not focus on the issue before us stands the general consensus in the legal and business communities that sales to governmental entities are not covered by the Robinson-Patman Act.  The majority devotes considerable effort to distinguishing or undercutting the authorities cited by the respondents.  In so doing, and in observing that these authorities cannot reveal Congress\' intent in 1936, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#165">460 U. S. 165</a></span>, n. 27, the majority misunderstands the significance of this evidence.  These authorities simply illustrate the virtually unanimous assumption over the past 47 years of noncoverage of governmental entities -- an assumption that has served as the basis of well-established governmental purchasing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 460 U. S. 183</a></p><p> practices and marketing relationships.  In the past, the Court has relied upon the widespread understanding of the provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act in limiting the scope of the Act\'s prohibitions. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  To do so here is no less appropriate.</p>\n<p>Despite its attempt to discount the significance of the judicial authorities cited by the respondents, the majority cannot dispute that no court has imposed liability upon a seller or buyer, under either \xc2\xa7 2(a) or \xc2\xa7 2(f), 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 13(a) and (f), in a case involving an alleged price discrimination in favor of a federal, state, or municipal governmental purchaser. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 460 U.

In 1967 and 1968, a congressional Subcommittee conducted public hearings on the problems of small businesses in the pharmaceutical industry.  The Subcommittee heard testimony from both representatives of pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacists regarding the industry-wide practice of price discrimination in sales of pharmaceuticals to governmental purchasers -- federal, state, county, and municipal. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Several witnesses also directly expressed their assumption that the Robinson-Patman Act does not apply to such sales.

However, Congress did not focus on the issue before us, and therefore did not provide a clear rationale governing coverage and noncoverage.  In an area in which bright lines are needed to guide state and local governments in their purchasing practices, the majority fails to identify any principle triggering inclusion or exclusion. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 460 U. S. 188</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Moreover, one cannot doubt that state, county, and municipal governments and manufacturers of commodities have structured their marketing relationships with each other on the longstanding assumption that the Robinson-Patman Act does not apply to those transactions.  That understanding finds substantial support among the courts and commentators.  State and local governments have developed programs for providing services to the public, including medical care to the indigent and the medically needy, [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>] based on the same assumption.  The majority\'s holding that sales of commodities to state and local governments for resale in competition with private enterprise are covered by the Act will engender significant disruption -- not only through government and industry reexamination and restructuring of marketing relationships, but also, unfortunately, through possible termination of services and supplies to needy citizens [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>] and through litigation associated with the process of reexamination. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  The Court rests its decision primarily on one statement in the legislative history, [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>] taken in isolation from other remarks designed to assure concerned House Members that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 460 U. S. 189</a></p><p> the Act would <em>not</em> force the abandonment of governmental below-market buying practices which the majority\'s holding now calls into question.  Given Congress\' failure to delineate the extent of the Robinson-Patman Act\'s coverage or noncoverage of state and local governments, I would allow Congress to speak on this issue, rather than disrupt longstanding practices and programs and judicially arm private litigants with a powerful treble damages action against these governments.  Therefore, I would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>This case does not require us to consider, as the cases cited by the majority suggest, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#157">460 U. S. 157</a></span>-158, whether compliance with other federal statutes necessitates an implied exemption from the provisions of the Act.  The question is simply one of congressional intent -- <em>i.e.,</em> what Congress intended when it enacted the Robinson-Patman Act with respect to coverage of governmental purchases for resale.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority cites <em>Pfizer Inc. v.

The Senator\'s observation reflects an affirmative response to Senator Vandenberg\'s concern that, although the bill was drafted with a view toward the problems of large chainstore buying power in the retail merchandising field, the Act would apply to <em>private</em> enterprise in the field of industrial production as well.  <em>See</em> 80 Cong.Rec. 6429-6430 (1936).\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Were Congress to consider the specific question of <em>liability</em> of governmental entities as purchasers under the Robinson-Patman Act, it seems reasonable to assume that it would approach that question with a different set of policy concerns than those bearing on the decision whether to extend the benefit of the Act\'s protections to those entities.  <em>Cf.

FTC,</em> 299 F. 733 (CA2), <em>cert. denied,</em> 266 U.S. 613 (1924).  Not until 1929 did this Court hold that \xc2\xa7 2 also protected against the type of injury alleged in the present case -- <em>i.e.,</em> secondary line injury, or injury to competition among buyers.  <em>See George Van Camp &amp; Sons Co. v.

In light of Representative Patman\'s agreement in his book, W.

("[T]he only special pricing we have ever engaged in are [<em>sic</em>] in bidding situations to [federal, state, or local government] agencies excluded from the Robinson-Patman Act"); <em>id.</em> at 1069 (C. Stetler, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association) ("There is nothing immoral or unlawful about incremental cost pricing in cases -- such as sales to the Government . . . -- where the Robinson-Patman Act does not apply").</p>\n<p>Even one Congressman on the Subcommittee expressed his understanding that the Act does not apply to governmental purchasers.  <em>See id.</em> at 1092 (Rep. Corman) ("[I]f there were no exemption under Robinson-Patman for the Government . . . what would be the situation as to their purchases?").  The colloquy that followed Representative Corman\'s question further evidences the assumption that governmental purchases are outside the scope of the Act, <em>even in the case of resales.</em></p>\n<p>"Mr. STETLER.  If there was no exemption under Robinson-Patman, I presume some of these practices would be illegal under Robinson-Patman."</p>\n<p>"Mr. CUTLER.  If I could try to answer that, [Representative] Corman. . . ."</p>\n<p>"[A]bsent the one case of these resales . . . , I suppose the lack of exemption would make no difference, because the Robinson-Patman Act would not apply for other reasons, because you are not discriminating between two people engaged in commerce and competing with one another."</p>\n<p>"Further, there is a real question as to whether the Robinson-Patman Act applies under any circumstances where you are bidding under a competitive bid.  So for both of these reasons, the answer to your question would be that the same pricing practices might still lawfully prevail under Robinson-Patman without <em>the exemption for the government. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/20" name="F2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>William McCamant, Director of Public Affairs for the National Association of Wholesalers, testified:</p>\n<p>"Over the years, the Robinson-Patman Act has not been extended to cover sales to the Government.  In the days when Government purchases constituted a relatively small volume in the marketplace, this exemption posed few problems.  But today, with the vast growth in Government purchases, Federal, State, and local, . . . the continued exemption creates many unfair competitive situations."</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"We believe that Congress must turn its attention to this problem."</p>\n<p>Small Business and the Robinson-Patman Act, Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on Small Business and the Robinson-Patman Act of the House Select Committee on Small Business, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 73-74 (1969-1970).  <em>See id.</em> at 76-77 (Everette MacIntyre, Acting Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission) (affirming that sales to the Federal Government, even in the resale context, are not subject to the Robinson-Patman Act).</p>\n<p>Harold Halfpenny, legal counsel for the Automotive Service Industry Association, focused most precisely on the problem of which petitioners complain -- <em>i.e.,</em> competitive injury to private industry when governmental entities receive more favorable prices on purchases of commodities for resale.</p>\n<p>"[W]hile the Act is silent on the subject, its legislative history and subsequent interpretation support the proposition that sales made to Federal or State governmental bodies are not subject to the provisions of the Act."</p>\n<p>"This may be injurious to competition in several ways. . . ."</p>\n<p>"[T]here are <em>\'second line\' situations where competition exists between the Government and private industry in the resale of commodities.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"The Federal Trade Commission has not recommended legislation to make the Robinson-Patman Act applicable to sales to governmental purchases.

More significantly, however, the uncertainty generated by the majority\'s failure to establish clear lines of demarcation for coverage and noncoverage and the fear of exposure to treble damages liability might well cause cautious legislators facing budgetary dilemmas to eliminate these programs.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/23" name="F2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]</p>\n<p>I note that the Court has not indicated that today\'s holding will have only prospective effect.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/24" name="F2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/150/case.html#161">460 U.
