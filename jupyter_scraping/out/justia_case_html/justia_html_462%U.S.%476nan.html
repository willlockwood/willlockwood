The sections relevant here include Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.025 (Supp.1982), requiring that abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy be performed in a hospital; [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] \xc2\xa7 188.047, requiring a pathology report for each abortion performed; [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] \xc2\xa7 188.030.3, requiring the presence of a second </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 462 U. S. 479</a></p><p> physician during abortions performed after viability; [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and \xc2\xa7 188.028, requiring minors to secure parental or judicial consent.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 462 U. S. 481</a></p><p> reversed the District Court\'s judgment with respect to \xc2\xa7 188.028, thereby upholding the requirement that a minor secure parental or judicial consent to an abortion.  It also held that the District Court erred in sustaining \xc2\xa7 188.047, the pathology requirement.  The District Court\'s judgment with respect to the second physician requirement was affirmed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings and findings relating to the second trimester hospitalization requirement.  655 F.2d 848, 872-873 (1981).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its holding that the second trimester hospitalization requirement was unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment.  664 F.2d 687, 691 (1981).  We granted certiorari.  456 U.S. 988 (1982).</p>\n<p>The Court today, in <em>City of Akron, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#426">462 U.

With these principles in mind, we turn to the statutes at issue.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>City of Akron,</em> we invalidated a city ordinance requiring physicians to perform all second trimester abortions at general or special hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) or by the American Osteopathic Association.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#431">462 U.

For the same reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals\' judgment that \xc2\xa7 188.025 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We turn now to the State\'s second physician requirement.  In <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html">410 U. S. 113</a></span> (1973), the Court recognized that the State has a compelling interest in the life of a viable fetus:</p>\n<p>"[T]he State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#164">410 U.

S. 379</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/case.html#386">439 U. S. 386</a></span>-387 (1979); <em>Beal v.

S. 445</a></span>-446 (1977).  Several of the Missouri statutes undertake such regulation.  Post-viability abortions are proscribed except when necessary to preserve the life or the health of the woman.  Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.030.1 (Supp.1982).  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 462 U. S. 483</a></p><p> State also forbids the use of abortion procedures fatal to the viable fetus unless alternative procedures pose a greater risk to the health of the woman.  \xc2\xa7 188.030.2.</p>\n<p>The statutory provision at issue in this case requires the attendance of a second physician at the abortion of a viable fetus.  \xc2\xa7 188.030.3.  This section requires that the second physician</p>\n<p>"take all reasonable steps in keeping with good medical practice . . . to preserve the life and health of the viable unborn child; provided that it does not pose an increased risk to the life or health of the woman."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  It also provides that the second physician "shall take control of and provide immediate medical care for a child born as a result of the abortion."</p>\n<p>The lower courts invalidated  188.030.3. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The plaintiffs, respondents here on this issue, urge affirmance on the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 462 U. S. 484</a></p><p> grounds that the second physician requirement distorts the traditional doctor-patient relationship, and is both impractical and costly.  They note that Missouri does not require two </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 462 U. S. 485</a></p><p> physicians in attendance for any other medical or surgical procedure, including childbirth or delivery of a premature infant.</p>\n<p>The first physician\'s primary concern will be the life and health of the woman.  Many third trimester abortions in Missouri will be emergency operations, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] as the State permits these late abortions only when they are necessary to preserve the life or the health of the woman.  It is not unreasonable for the State to assume that, during the operation, the first physician\'s attention and skills will be directed to preserving the woman\'s health, and not to protecting the actual life of those fetuses who survive the abortion procedure.  Viable fetuses will be in immediate and grave danger because of their premature birth.  A second physician, in situations where Missouri permits third trimester abortions, may be of assistance to the woman\'s physician in preserving the health and life of the child.</p>\n<p>By giving immediate medical attention to a fetus that is delivered alive, the second physician will assure that the State\'s interests are protected more fully than the first physician alone would be able to do.  And given the compelling interest that the State has in preserving life, we cannot say that the Missouri requirement of a second physician in those unusual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 462 U. S. 486</a></p><p> circumstances where Missouri permits a third trimester abortion is unconstitutional.  Preserving the life of a viable fetus that is aborted may not often be possible, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] but the State legitimately may choose to provide safeguards for the comparatively few instances of live birth that occur.  We believe the second physician requirement reasonably furthers the State\'s compelling interest in protecting the lives of viable fetuses, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals holding that \xc2\xa7 188.030.3 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In regulating hospital services within the State, Missouri requires that</p>\n<p>"[a]ll tissue surgically removed with the exception of such tissue as tonsils, adenoids, hernial sacs and prepuces, shall be examined by a pathologist, either on the premises or by arrangement outside of the hospital."</p>\n<p>13 Mo.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 50-20.030(3)(A)7 (1977).  With respect to abortions, whether performed in hospitals or in some other facility, \xc2\xa7 188.047 requires the pathologist to "file a copy of the tissue report with the state division of health. . . ."  <em>See</em> <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em>  The pathologist also is required to "provide a copy of the report to the abortion facility or hospital in which the abortion was performed or induced."  Thus, Missouri appears to require that tissue following abortions, as well as from almost all other surgery performed in hospitals, must be submitted to a pathologist, not merely examined by the performing doctor.  The narrow question before us is whether the State lawfully also may require the tissue removed following </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 462 U. S. 487</a></p><p> abortions performed in clinics as well as in hospitals to be submitted to a pathologist.</p>\n<p>On its face and in effect, \xc2\xa7 188.047 is reasonably related to generally accepted medical standards and "further[s] important health-related state concerns."  <em>City of Akron, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#430">462 U. S. 430</a></span>.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, pathology examinations are clearly "useful and even necessary in some cases," because "abnormalities in the tissue may warn of serious, possibly fatal disorders."  655 F.2d at 870. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  As a rule, it is accepted medical practice to submit all tissue to the examination of a pathologist. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  This is particularly important following abortion, because questions remain as to the long-range </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 462 U.

This argument disregards the fact that Missouri requires a pathologist -- not the performing physician -- to examine tissue after almost every type of surgery.  Although this requirement is in a provision relating to surgical procedures in hospitals, many of the same procedures included within the Missouri statute customarily are performed also in outpatient clinics.  No reason has been suggested why the prudence required in a hospital should not be equally appropriate in such a clinic.  Indeed, there may be good reason to impose stricter standards in this respect on clinics performing abortions than on hospitals.

In this case, for example, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a widely experienced abortion practitioner, testified that he requires a pathologist examination after each of the 60,000 abortions performed under his direction at the New York Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health.  He considers it</p>\n<p>"absolutely necessary to obtain a pathologist\'s report on each and every specimen of tissue removed from abortion, or for that matter from any other surgical procedure which involves the removal of tissue from the human body."</p>\n<p>App. 143-144.  <em>See also id.</em> at 146-147 (testimony of Dr. Keitges); 5 Record 798-799 (testimony of Dr. Schmidt).

The court then reached the logical conclusion that "findings and the ultimate denial of the petition must be supported by a showing of <em>good cause.\'"  655 F.2d at 858.  The Court of Appeals reasonably found that a court could not deny a petition "for good cause" unless it first found -- after having received the required evidence -- that the minor was not mature enough to make her own decision.  <em>See Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#643">443 U.

The petition for certiorari raises the issue whether an award of attorney\'s fees, made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 (1976 ed., Supp. V), should be proportioned to reflect the extent to which plaintiffs prevailed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Missouri does not define the term "hospital" in its statutory provisions regulating abortions.  We therefore must assume, as did the courts below, <em>see</em> 483 F.Supp. 679, 686, n. 10 (1980); 664 F.2d 687, 689-690, and nn. 3, 5, and 6 (1981), that the term has its common meaning of a general, acute care facility.  <em>Cf.</em> Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.015(2) (Supp.1982) (defining "abortion facility" as "a clinic, physician\'s office, or any other place or facility in which abortions are performed other than a hospital").  Section 197.020.2 (1978), part of Missouri\'s hospital licensing laws, reads:</p>\n<p>"\'Hospital\'\' means a place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment or care for not less than twenty-four hours in any week of three or more nonrelated individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury, deformity or other abnormal physical conditions; or a place devoted primarily to provide for not less than twenty-four hours in any week medical . . . care for three or more nonrelated individuals. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Cf.</em> Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 197.200(1) (1978) (defining "ambulatory surgical center" to include facilities "with an organized medical staff of physicians" and "with continuous physician services and registered professional nursing services whenever a patient is in the facility"); 13 Mo.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 50-30.010(1)(A) (1977) (same).

These are not unlike those set by JCAH.  <em>See City of Akron, ante,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#432">462 U. S. 432</a></span>, and n. 16.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The courts below found, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'s partial dissenting opinion agrees, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#499">462 U. S. 499</a></span>-500, that there is no possible justification for a second physician requirement whenever D&amp;E is used, because no viable fetus can survive a D&amp;E procedure.  483 F.Supp. at 694; 655 F.2d at 865.  Accordingly, for them, \xc2\xa7 188.030.3 is overbroad.  This reasoning rests on two assumptions.  First, a fetus cannot survive a D&amp;E abortion, and second, D&amp;E is the method of choice in the third trimester.  There is general agreement as to the first proposition, but not as to the second.  Indeed, almost all of the authorities disagree with JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'s critical assumption, and as the Court of Appeals noted, the choice of this procedure after viability is subject to the requirements of \xc2\xa7 188.030.2.  <em>See id.</em> at 865, and n. 28.  Nevertheless, the courts below, in conclusory language, found that D&amp;E is the "method of choice even after viability is possible."  <em>Id.</em> at 865.  No scholarly writing supporting this view is cited by those courts or by the partial dissent.  Reliance apparently is placed solely on the testimony of Dr. Robert Crist, a physician from Kansas, to whom the District Court referred in a footnote.  483 F.Supp. at 694, n. 25.  This testimony provides slim support for this holding.  Dr. Crist\'s testimony, if nothing else, is remarkable in its candor.  He is a member of the National Abortion Federation, "an organization of abortion providers and people interested in the pro-choice movement."  3 Record 415-416.  He supported the use of D&amp;E on 28-week pregnancies, well into the third trimester.  In some circumstances, he considered it a better procedure than other methods.  <em>See id.</em> at 427-428.  His disinterest in protecting fetal life is evidenced by his agreement "that the abortion patient has a right not only to be rid of the growth, called a fetus in her body, but also has a right to a dead fetus."  <em>Id.</em> at 431.  He also agreed that he "[n]ever ha[s] any intention of trying to protect the fetus, if it can be saved," <em>ibid.,</em> and finally that, "as a general principle," "[t]here should not be a live fetus," <em>id.</em> at 435.  Moreover, contrary to every other view, he thought a fetus could survive a D&amp;E abortion.  <em>Id.</em> at 433-434.  None of the other physicians who testified at the trial, those called both by the plaintiffs and defendants, considered that any use of D&amp;E after viability was indicated.  <em>See</em> 2 Record 21 (limiting use of D&amp;E to under 18 weeks); 3 Record 381, 410-413 (Dr. Robert Kretzschmar) (D&amp;E up to 17 weeks; would never perform D&amp;E after 26 weeks); 5 Record 787 (almost "inconceivable" to use D&amp;E after viability); 7 Record 52 (D&amp;E safest up to 18 weeks); <em>id.</em> at 110 (doctor not performing D&amp;E past 20 weeks); <em>id.</em> at 111 (risks of doing outpatient D&amp;E equivalent to childbirth at 24 weeks).  <em>See also</em> 8 Record 33, 78-81 (deposition of Dr. Willard Cates) (16 weeks latest D&amp;E performed).  Apparently Dr. Crist performed abortions only in Kansas, 3 Record 334, 368, 428, a State having no statutes comparable to \xc2\xa7 188.030.1 and \xc2\xa7 188.030.2.  It is not clear whether he was operating under or familiar with the limitations imposed by Missouri law.  Nor did he explain the circumstances when there were "contraindications" against the use of any of the procedures that could preserve viability, or whether his conclusory opinion was limited to emergency situations.  Indeed, there is no record evidence that D&amp;E ever will be the method that poses the least risk to the woman in those rare situations where there are compelling medical reasons for performing an abortion after viability.  If there were such instances, they hardly would justify invalidating \xc2\xa7 188.030.3.</p>\n<p>In addition to citing Dr. Crist in its footnote, the District Court cited -- with no elaboration -- Dr. Schmidt.  His testimony, reflecting no agreement with Dr. Crist, is enlightening.  Although he conceded that the attendance of a second physician for a D&amp;E abortion on a viable fetus was not necessary, he considered the point mostly theoretical, because he "simply [did] not believe that the question of viability comes up when D&amp;E is an elected method of abortion."  5 Record 836.  When reminded of Dr. Crist\'s earlier testimony, he conceded the remote possibility of third trimester D&amp;E abortions, but stated:  "I personally cannot conceive that as a significant practical point.  It may be important legally, but [not] from a medical standpoint. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Given that Dr. Crist\'s discordant testimony is wholly unsupported, the State\'s compelling interest in protecting a viable fetus justifies the second physician requirement even though there may be the rare case when a physician may think honestly that D&amp;E is required for the mother\'s health.  Legislation need not accommodate every conceivable contingency.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>There is no clearly expressed exception on the face of the statute for the performance of an abortion of a viable fetus without the second physician in attendance.  There may be emergency situations where, for example, the woman\'s health may be endangered by delay.  Section 188.030.3 is qualified, at least in part, by the phrase "provided that it does not pose an increased risk to the life or health of the woman."  This clause reasonably could be construed to apply to such a situation.  <em>Cf. H. L. v. Matheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html">450 U.

JUSTICE BLACMUN\'s partial dissent, however, relies on the recent modification of these Standards as they apply to abortions.  ACOG now provides an "exception to the practice" of mandatory examination by a pathologist and makes such examination for abortion tissue permissive.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Not surprisingly, this change in policy was controversial within the College.  <em>See</em> 5 Record 799-800.

The Sun-Times of Chicago, in a series of special reports, disclosed widespread questionable practices in abortion clinics in Chicago, including the failure to obtain proper pathology reports.  <em>See</em> The Abortion Profiteers, Chicago Sun-Times 25-26 (Special Reprint 1978).  It is clear, therefore, that a State reasonably could conclude that a pathology requirement is necessary in abortion clinics as well as in general hospitals.</p>\n<p>In suggesting that we make from a "comfortable perspective" the judgment that a State constitutionally can require the additional cost of a pathology examination, JUSTICE BLACKMUN\'s partial dissent suggests that we disregard the interests of the "woman on welfare or the unemployed teenager."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#498">462 U.

Immediately after the effective date of this statutory enactment, the District Court enjoined enforcement.  No unemancipated pregnant minor has been required to comply with this section.  Thus, to this point in time, there has been no need for the State Supreme Court to promulgate rules concerning appellate review.  There is no reason to believe that Missouri will not expedite any appeal consistent with the mandate in our prior opinions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf. H.

Plaintiffs did not, however, argue in the Court of Appeals that the court should abstain, and Missouri has no certification procedure whereby this Court can refer questions of state statutory construction to the State Supreme Court.  <em>See</em> 655 F.2d at 861, n. 20; 17 C.

Moreover, where, as here, a statute is susceptible to a fair construction that obviates the need to have the state courts render the saving construction, there is no reason for federal courts to abstain.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision today in <em>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html">462 U. S. 416</a></span>, invalidates the city of Akron\'s hospitalization requirement and a host of other provisions that infringe on a woman\'s decision to terminate her pregnancy through abortion.  I agree that Missouri\'s hospitalization requirement is invalid under the <em>Akron</em> analysis, and I join Parts  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#478">462 U. S. </a></span>S. 481|&gt;II of JUSTICE POWELL\'s opinion in the present cases.  I do not agree, however, that the remaining Missouri statutes challenged in these cases satisfy the constitutional standards set forth in <em>Akron</em> and the Court\'s prior decisions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Missouri law provides that, whenever an abortion is performed, a tissue sample must be submitted to a "board eligible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 462 U. S. 495</a></p><p> or certified pathologist" for a report.  Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.047 (Supp.1982).  This requirement applies to first trimester abortions as well as to those performed later in pregnancy.  Our past decisions establish that the performance of abortions during the first trimester must be left "<em>free of interference by the State.\'"  <em>Akron, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#430">462 U.

As we have noted in <em>Akron,</em> this does not mean that every regulation touching upon first trimester abortions is constitutionally impermissible.  But to pass constitutional muster, regulations affecting first trimester abortions must "have no significant impact on the woman\'s exercise of her right," and must be "justified by important state health objectives."  <em>Akron, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#430">462 U. S. 430</a></span>; <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#489">462 U. S. 489</a></span>-490.\n</em></p>\n<p>Missouri\'s requirement of a pathologist\'s report is not justified by important health objectives.  Although pathology examinations may be "useful and even necessary in some cases," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#487">462 U. S. 487</a></span>, Missouri requires more than a pathology examination and a pathology report; it demands that the examination be performed and the report prepared by a "board eligible or certified pathologist," rather than by the attending physician.  Contrary to JUSTICE POWELL\'s assertion, <em>ibid.,</em> this requirement of a report by a pathologist is not in accord with "generally accepted medical standards."  The routine and accepted medical practice is for the attending physician to perform a gross (visual) examination of any tissue removed during an abortion.  Only if the physician detects abnormalities is there a need to send a tissue sample to a pathologist.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) does not recommend an examination by a pathologist in every case:</p>\n<p>"In the situation of elective termination of pregnancy, the attending physician should record a description of the gross products.  Unless definite embryonic or fetal parts can be identified, the products of elective interruptions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 462 U. S. 496</a></p><p> of pregnancy must be submitted to a pathologist for gross and microscopic examination."</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>". . .  Aspirated tissue should be examined to ensure the presence of villi or fetal parts prior to the patient\'s release from the facility.  If villi or fetal parts are not identified with certainty, the tissue specimen must be sent for further pathologic examination. . . ."</p>\n<p>ACOG, Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 52, 54 (5th ed.1982). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor does the National Abortion Federation believe that such an examination is necessary:</p>\n<p>"All tissue must be examined grossly at the time of the abortion procedure by a physician or trained assistant and the results recorded in the chart.  In the absence of visible fetal parts or placenta upon gross examination, obtained tissue may be examined under a low power microscope for the detection of villi.  If this examination is inconclusive, the tissue should be sent to the nearest suitable pathology laboratory for microscopic examination."</p>\n<p>National Abortion Federation Standards 6 (1981) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals pointed out, there was expert testimony at trial that a nonpathologist physician is as capable of performing an adequate gross examination as is a pathologist, and that the "abnormalities which are of concern" are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 462 U. S. 497</a></p><p> readily detectable by a physician.  655 F.2d 848, 871, n. 37 (CA8 1981); <em>see</em> App. 135. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  While a pathologist may be better able to perform a microscopic examination, Missouri law does not require a microscopic examination unless "fetal parts or placenta are not identified."  13 Mo.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 50-151.030(1) (1981).  Thus, the effect of the Missouri statute is to require a pathologist to perform the initial gross examination, which is normally the responsibility of the attending physician and which will often make the pathologist\'s services unnecessary.</p>\n<p>On the record before us, I must conclude that the State has not "met its burden of demonstrating that [the pathologist requirement] further[s] important health-related State concerns."  <em>Akron, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#430">462 U. S. 430</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  There has been no showing that tissue examinations by a pathologist do more to protect health than examinations by a nonpathologist physician.  Missouri does not require pathologists\' reports for any other surgical procedures performed in clinics, or for minor surgery performed in hospitals.  13 Mo.Admin.Code \xc2\xa7 50-20.030(3)(A)(7) (1977).  Moreover, I cannot agree with JUSTICE POWELL that Missouri\'s pathologist requirement has "no significant impact" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#489">462 U. S. 489</a></span>, on a woman\'s exercise of her right to an abortion.  It is undisputed that this requirement may increase the cost of a first trimester abortion by as much as $40.  <em>See</em> 483 F.Supp. 679, 700, n. 48 (WD Mo.1980).  Although this increase may seem insignificant from the Court\'s comfortable perspective, I cannot say that it is equally insignificant to every woman seeking an abortion.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 462 U.

Today, in <em>Akron,</em> we have struck down restrictions on first trimester abortions that "may in some cases add to the cost of providing abortions."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#447">462 U.

Missouri\'s requirement of a pathologist\'s report unquestionably adds significantly to the cost of providing abortions, and Missouri has not shown that it serves any substantial health-related purpose.  Under these circumstances, I would hold that constitutional limits have been exceeded.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In Missouri, an abortion may be performed after viability only if necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.  Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.030.1 (Supp.1982).  When a post-viability abortion is performed, Missouri law provides that</p>\n<p>"there [must be] in attendance a [second] physician . . . who </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 462 U. S. 499</a></p><p> shall take control of and provide immediate medical care for a child born as a result of the abortion."</p>\n<p>Mo.Rev. Stat \xc2\xa7 188.030.3 (Supp.1982).  The Court recognized in <em>Roe v Wade,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#164">410 U. S. 164</a></span>-165, that a State\'s interests in preserving maternal health and protecting the potentiality of human life may justify regulation and even prohibition of post-viability abortions, except those necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother.  But regulations governing post-viability abortions, like those at any other stage of pregnancy, must be "tailored to the recognized state interests."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#165">410 U.

S. 486</a></span>.  While I agree that a second physician indeed may aid in preserving the life of a fetus born alive, this type of aid is possible only when the abortion method used is one that may result in a live birth.  Although Missouri ordinarily requires a physician performing a post-viability abortion to use the abortion method most likely to preserve fetal life, this restriction does not apply when this method "would present a greater risk to the life and health of the woman."  Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.030.2 (Supp.1982).</p>\n<p>The District Court found that the dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E) method of abortion entails no chance of fetal survival, and that it will nevertheless be the method of choice for some women who need post-viability abortions.  In some cases, in other words, maternal health considerations will preclude the use of procedures that might result in a live birth.  483 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 462 U. S. 500</a></p><p> F.Supp. at 694. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  When a D&amp;E abortion is performed, the second physician can do nothing to further the State\'s compelling interest in protecting potential life.  His presence is superfluous.  The second physician requirement thus is overbroad and "imposes a burden on women in cases where the burden is not justified by any possibility of survival of the fetus."  655 F.2d at 865-866.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL apparently believes that the State\'s interest in preserving potential life justifies the State in requiring a second physician at all post-viability abortions because some methods other than D&amp;E may result in live births.  But this fact cannot justify requiring a second physician to attend an abortion at which the chance of a live birth is nonexistent.  The choice of method presumably will be made in advance, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] and any need for a second physician disappears when </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 462 U. S. 501</a></p><p> the woman\'s health requires that the choice be D&amp;E.  Because the statute is not tailored to protect the State\'s legitimate interests, I would hold it invalid. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In addition, I would hold that the statute\'s failure to provide a clear exception for emergency situations renders it unconstitutional.  As JUSTICE POWELL recognizes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#485">462 U. S. 485</a></span>, n. 8, an emergency may arise in which delay could be dangerous to the life or health of the woman.  A second physician may not always be available in such a situation; yet the statute appears to require one.  It states, in unqualified terms, that a post-viability abortion "<em>shall</em> be performed . . . <em>only</em> when there is in attendance" a second physician who "<em>shall</em> take control of " any child born as a result of the abortion, and it imposes certain duties on "the physician <em>required</em> by this section to be in attendance."   Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.030.3 (Supp.1982) (emphasis added).  By requiring the attendance of a second physician even when the resulting delay may be harmful to the health of the pregnant woman, the statute impermissibly fails to make clear "that the woman\'s life and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 462 U. S. 502</a></p><p> health must always prevail over the fetus\' life and health when they conflict."  <em>Colautti v.

S. 400</a></span> (1979).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL attempts to cure this defect by asserting that the final clause of the statute, requiring the two physicians to</p>\n<p>"take all reasonable steps . . . to preserve the life and health of the viable unborn child; provided that it does not pose an increased risk to the life or health of the woman,"</p>\n<p>could be construed to permit emergency post-viability abortions without a second physician.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/476/case.html#485">462 U. S. 485</a></span>, n. 8.  This construction is contrary to the plain language of the statute; the clause upon which JUSTICE POWELL relies refers to the duties of both physicians during the performance of the abortion, but it in no way suggests that the second physician may be dispensed with.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since JUSTICE POWELL\'s proposed construction is not binding on the courts of Missouri, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] a physician performing an emergency post-viability abortion cannot rely on it with any degree of confidence.  The statute thus remains impermissibly vague; it fails to inform the physician whether he may proceed with a post-viability abortion in an emergency, or whether he must wait for a second physician even if the woman\'s life or health will be further imperiled by the delay.  This vagueness may well have a severe chilling effect on the physician who perceives the patient\'s need for a post-viability abortion.  In <em>Colautti v. Franklin,</em> we considered a statute that failed to specify whether it "require[d] the physician to make a <em>trade-off \' between the woman\'s health and additional percentage points of fetal survival."  439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/393/case.html#400">462 U.

As a practical matter, I would suppose that the need to commence judicial proceedings in order to obtain a legal abortion would impose a burden at least as great as, and probably greater than, that imposed on the minor child by the need to obtain the consent of the parent.  Moreover, once this burden is met, the only standard provided for the judge\'s decision is the best interest of the minor.  That standard provides little real guidance to the judge, and his decision must necessarily reflect personal and societal values and mores whose enforcement upon the minor -- particularly when contrary to her own informed and reasonable decision -- is fundamentally at odds with privacy interests underlying the constitutional protection afforded to her decision."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (footnote omitted).  Because Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 188.028 (Supp.1982) permits a parental or judicial veto of a minor\'s decision to obtain an abortion, I would hold it unconstitutional. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 462 U.

Doctor Crist testified that, in some instances, abortion methods other than D&amp;E would be "absolutely contraindicated" by the woman\'s health condition,  3 Record 438-439, giving the example of a recent patient with hemolytic anemia that would have been aggravated by the use of prostaglandins or other labor-inducing abortion methods, <em>id.</em> at 428.  Doctor Schmidt testified that "[t]here very well may be" situations in which D&amp;E would be used because other methods were contraindicated.  5 Record 836.  Although Doctor Schmidt previously had testified that a post-viability D&amp;E abortion was "almost inconceivable," this was in response to a question by the State\'s attorney regarding whether D&amp;E would be used "[a]bsent the possibility that there is extreme contraindication for the use of prostaglandins or saline, or of hysterotomy."  <em>Id.</em> at 787.  Any inconsistencies in Doctor Schmidt\'s testimony apparently were resolved by the District Court in the plaintiffs\' favor.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\'s factual finding that health reasons sometimes would require the use of D&amp;E for post-viability abortions.  655 F.2d at 865.

I note, however, that Missouri does not require attendance of a second physician at any other medical procedure, including a premature birth.  There was testimony at trial that a newborn infant, whether the product of a normal birth or an abortion, ordinarily remains the responsibility of the woman\'s physician until he turns its care over to another.  App. 133; <em>see</em> ACOG, Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 31 (5th ed., 1982) ("The individual who delivers the baby is responsible for the immediate post-delivery care of the newborn until another person assumes this duty").</p>\n<p>This allocation of responsibility makes sense.  Consultation and teamwork are fundamental in medical practice, but in an operating room, a patient\'s life or health may depend on split-second decisions by the physician.  If responsibility and control must be shared between two physicians with the lines of authority unclear, precious moments may be lost to the detriment of both woman and child.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>For reasons stated in my dissent in <em>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html">462 U. S. 416</a></span>, I believe that the second trimester hospitalization requirement imposed by \xc2\xa7 188.025 does not impose an undue burden on the limited right to undergo an abortion.  Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that the requirement was an undue burden, it would nevertheless "reasonably relat[e] to the preservation and protection of maternal health."  <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html">410 U. S. 113</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163">410 U.

I therefore dissent from the Court\'s judgment that the requirement is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>I agree that the second physician requirement contained in \xc2\xa7 188.030.3 is constitutional because the State possesses a compelling interest in protecting and preserving fetal life, but I believe that this state interest is extant throughout pregnancy.  I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>I agree that the pathology report requirement imposed by \xc2\xa7 188.047 is constitutional because it imposes no undue burden on the limited right to undergo an abortion.  Because I do not believe that the validity of this requirement is contingent in any way on the trimester of pregnancy in which it is imposed, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that the State cannot impose a parental veto on the decision of a minor to undergo an abortion, I agree that the parental consent provision contained in \xc2\xa7 188.028 is constitutional.  However, I believe that the provision is valid because it imposes no undue burden on any right that a minor may have to undergo an abortion.
