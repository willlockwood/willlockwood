In 2012 he told a same-sex couple that he would not create a cake for their wedding celebration because of his religious opposition to same-sex marriages\xe2\x80\x94marriages that Colorado did not then recognize\xe2\x80\x94but that he would sell them other baked goods, <i>e.g., </i>birthday cakes.  The couple filed a charge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) pursuant to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), which prohibits, as relevant here, discrimination based on sexual orientation in a<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cplace of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place offering services .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under CADA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative review system, the Colorado Civil Rights Division first found probable cause for a violation and referred the case to the Commission.  The Commission then referred the case for a formal hearing before a state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who ruled in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  In so doing, the ALJ rejected Phillips\xe2\x80\x99\n \nFirst Amendment claims: that requiring him to create a cake for a same-sex wedding would violate his right to free speech by compelling him to exercise his artistic talents to express a message with which he disagreed and would violate his right to the free exercise of religion.  Both the Commission and the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s actions in this case violated the Free Exercise Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect gay persons and gay couples in the exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.  See <i>Obergefell</i> v. <i>Hodges</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  While it is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring products and services on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.  To Phillips, his claim that using his artistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own voice and of his own creation, has a significant\n \nFirst Amendment speech component and implicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs.  His dilemma was understandable in 2012, which was before Colorado recognized the validity of gay marriages performed in the State and before this Court issued <i>United States</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 744, or <i>Obergefell</i>.  Given the State\xe2\x80\x99s position at the time, there is some force to Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 argument that he was not unreasonable in deeming his decision lawful.  State law at the time also afforded storekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages they considered offensive.  Indeed, while the instant enforcement proceedings were pending, the State Civil Rights Division concluded in at least three cases that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages.  Phillips too was entitled to a neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0That consideration was compromised, however, by the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case, which showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection.  As the record shows, some of the commissioners at the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s formal, public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 faith as despicable and characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust.  No commissioners objected to the comments.  Nor were they mentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the briefs filed here.  The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Another indication of hostility is the different treatment of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case and the cases of other bakers with objections to anti-gay messages who prevailed before the Commission.  The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the theory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker.  Yet the Division did not address this point in any of the cases involving requests for cakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism.  The Division also considered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to the prospective customers, but the Commission found Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to do the same irrelevant.  The State Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 brief discussion of this disparity of treatment does not answer Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 concern that the State\xe2\x80\x99s practice was to disfavor the religious basis of his objection.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case violated the State\xe2\x80\x99s duty under the\n \nFirst Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.  The government, consistent with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose regulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected citizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.  <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520.  Factors relevant to the assessment of governmental neutrality include \xe2\x80\x9cthe historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 540.  In view of these factors, the record here demonstrates that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case was neither tolerant nor respectful of his religious beliefs.  The Commission gave \xe2\x80\x9cevery appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 545, of adjudicating his religious objection based on a negative normative \xe2\x80\x9cevaluation of the particular justification\xe2\x80\x9d for his objection and the religious grounds for it, <i>id</i>., at 537, but government has no role in expressing or even suggesting whether the religious ground for Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate.  The inference here is thus that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious objection was not considered with the neutrality required by the Free Exercise Clause.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest could have been weighed against Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed.  But the official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners\xe2\x80\x99 comments were inconsistent with that requirement, and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s disparate consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case compared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.

The shop\xe2\x80\x99s owner told the couple that he would not create a cake for their wedding because of his religious opposition to same-sex marriages\xe2\x80\x94marriages the State of Colorado itself did not recognize at that time.  The couple filed a charge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commission determined that the shop\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated the Act and ruled in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Colorado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement order, and this Court now must decide whether the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The case presents difficult questions as to the proper reconciliation of at least two principles.  The first is the authority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the rights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married but who face discrimination when they seek goods or services.  The second is the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms under the\n \nFirst Amendment, as applied to the States through the\n \nFourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The freedoms asserted here are both the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion.  The free speech aspect of this case is difficult, for few persons who have seen a beautiful wedding cake might have thought of its creation as an exercise of protected speech.  This is an instructive example, however, of the proposition that the application of constitutional freedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One of the difficulties in this case is that the parties disagree as to the extent of the baker\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to provide service.  If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or images celebrating the marriage\xe2\x80\x94for instance, a cake showing words with religious meaning\xe2\x80\x94that might be different from a refusal to sell any cake at all.  In defining whether a baker\xe2\x80\x99s creation can be protected, these details might make a difference.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same difficulties arise in determining whether a baker has a valid free exercise claim.  A baker\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way, or a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the cake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the public generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on it are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but endless.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whatever the confluence of speech and free exercise principles might be in some cases, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of this case was inconsistent with the State\xe2\x80\x99s obligation of religious neutrality.  The reason and motive for the baker\xe2\x80\x99s refusal were based on his sincere religious beliefs and convictions.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws.  Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach.  That requirement, however, was not met here.  When the Colorado Civil Rights Commission considered this case, it did not do so with the religious neutrality that the Constitution requires.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given all these considerations, it is proper to hold that whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving facts similar to these, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s actions here violated the Free Exercise Clause; and its order must be set aside.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a bakery in Lakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.  The shop offers a variety of baked goods, ranging from everyday cookies and brownies to elaborate custom-designed cakes for birthday parties, weddings, and other events.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Jack Phillips is an expert baker who has owned and operated the shop for 24 years.  Phillips is a devout Christian.  He has explained that his \xe2\x80\x9cmain goal in life is to be obedient to\xe2\x80\x9d Jesus Christ and Christ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cteachings in all aspects of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 148.  And he seeks to \xe2\x80\x9chonor God through his work at Masterpiece Cakeshop.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>One of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs is that \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s intention for marriage from the beginning of history is that it is and should be the union of one man and one woman.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 149.  To Phillips, creating a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding would be equivalent to participating in a celebration that is contrary to his own most deeply held beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when they entered his shop in the summer of 2012.  Craig and Mullins were planning to marry.  At that time, Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed legally in Massachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family and friends in Denver.  To prepare for their celebration, Craig and Mullins visited the shop and told Phillips that they were interested in ordering a cake for \xe2\x80\x9cour wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 152 (emphasis de- leted).  They did not mention the design of the cake they envisioned.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips informed the couple that he does not \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d wedding cakes for same-sex weddings.  <i>Ibid.</i>  He explained, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t make cakes for same sex weddings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The couple left the shop without further discussion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The following day, Craig\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who had accompanied the couple to the cakeshop and been present for their interaction with Phillips, telephoned to ask Phillips why he had declined to serve her son.  Phillips explained that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious opposition to same-sex marriage, and also because Colorado (at that time) did not recognize same-sex marriages.  <i>Id.</i>, at 153.  He later explained his belief that \xe2\x80\x9cto create a wedding cake for an event that celebrates something that directly goes against the teachings of the Bible, would have been a personal endorsement and participation in the ceremony and relationship that they were entering into.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For most of its history, Colorado has prohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation.  In 1885, less than a decade after Colorado achieved statehood, the General Assembly passed \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to Protect All Citizens in Their Civil Rights,\xe2\x80\x9d which guaranteed \xe2\x80\x9cfull and equal enjoyment\xe2\x80\x9d of certain public facilities to \xe2\x80\x9call citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  1885 Colo. Sess. Laws pp. 132\xe2\x80\x93133.  A decade later, the General Assembly expanded the requirement to apply to \xe2\x80\x9call other places of public accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  1895 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, p. 139.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) carries forward the state\xe2\x80\x99s tradition of prohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation.  Amended in 2007 and 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in relevant part provides as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a discriminatory practice and unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or deny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Colo.

Complaints of discrimination in violation of CADA are addressed in the first instance by the Colorado Civil Rights Division.  The Division investigates each claim; and if it finds probable cause that CADA has been violated, it will refer the matter to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.  The Commission, in turn, decides whether to initiate a formal hearing before a state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who will hear evidence and argument before issuing a written decision.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x80\x93306, 24\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93105(14).  The decision of the ALJ may be appealed to the full Commission, a seven-member appointed body.  The Commission holds a public hearing and deliberative session before voting on the case.  If the Commission determines that the evidence proves a CADA violation, it may impose remedial measures as provided by statute.  See \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x80\x93306(9).  Available remedies include, among other things, orders to cease-and-desist a discriminatory policy, to file regular compliance reports with the Commission, and \xe2\x80\x9cto take affirmative action, including the posting of notices setting forth the substantive rights of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x80\x93605.

App. 31.  The complaint alleged that Craig and Mullins had been denied \xe2\x80\x9cfull and equal service\xe2\x80\x9d at the bakery because of their sexual orientation, <i>id.</i>, at 35, 48, and that it was Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cstandard business practice\xe2\x80\x9d not to provide cakes for same-sex weddings, <i>id.</i>, at 43.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Civil Rights Division opened an investigation.  The investigator found that \xe2\x80\x9con multiple occasions,\xe2\x80\x9d Phillips \xe2\x80\x9cturned away potential customers on the basis of their sexual orientation, stating that he could not create a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony or reception\xe2\x80\x9d because his religious beliefs prohibited it and because the potential customers \xe2\x80\x9cwere doing something illegal\xe2\x80\x9d at that time.  <i>Id.</i>, at 76.  The investigation found that Phillips had declined to sell custom wedding cakes to about six other same-sex couples on this basis.  <i>Id.</i>, at 72.  The investigator also recounted that, according to affidavits submitted by Craig and Mullins, Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 shop had refused to sell cupcakes to a lesbian couple for their commitment celebration because the shop \xe2\x80\x9chad a policy of not selling baked goods to same-sex couples for this type of event.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 73.  Based on these findings, the Division found probable cause that Phillips violated CADA and referred the case to the Civil Rights Commission.  <i>Id.</i>, at 69.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commission found it proper to conduct a formal hearing, and it sent the case to a State ALJ.  Finding no dispute as to material facts, the ALJ entertained cross-motions for summary judgment and ruled in the couple\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The ALJ first rejected Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 argument that declining to make or create a wedding cake for Craig and Mullins did not violate Colorado law.  It was undisputed that the shop is subject to state public accommodations laws.  And the ALJ determined that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 actions constituted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex- ual orientation, not simply opposition to same-sex marriage as Phillips contended.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a\xe2\x80\x9372a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips raised two constitutional claims before the ALJ.  He first asserted that applying CADA in a way that would require him to create a cake for a same-sex wedding would violate his\n \nFirst Amendment right to free speech by compelling him to exercise his artistic talents to express a message with which he disagreed.  The ALJ rejected the contention that preparing a wedding cake is a form of protected speech and did not agree that creating Craig and Mullins\xe2\x80\x99 cake would force Phillips to adhere to \xe2\x80\x9can ideological point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 75a.  Applying CADA to the facts at hand, in the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s view, did not interfere with Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of speech.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips also contended that requiring him to create cakes for same-sex weddings would violate his right to the free exercise of religion, also protected by the First Amendment.  Citing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent in <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. </i>v.<i> Smith</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872 (1990), the ALJ determined that CADA is a \xe2\x80\x9cvalid and neutral law of general applicability\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore that applying it to Phillips in this case did not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  <i>Id</i>., at 879; App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a\xe2\x80\x9383a.  The ALJ thus ruled against Phillips and the cakeshop and in favor of Craig and Mullins on both constitutional claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commission affirmed the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision in full.  <i>Id.</i>, at 57a.  The Commission ordered Phillips to \xe2\x80\x9ccease and desist from discriminating against . . . same-sex couples by refusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [they] would sell to heterosexual couples.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  It also ordered additional remedial measures, including \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive staff training on the Public Accommodations section\xe2\x80\x9d of CADA \xe2\x80\x9cand changes to any and all company policies to comply with . .\xc2\xa0. this Order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 58a.  The Commission additionally required Phillips to prepare \xe2\x80\x9cquarterly compliance reports\xe2\x80\x9d for a period of two years documenting \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of patrons denied service\xe2\x80\x9d and why, along with \xe2\x80\x9ca statement describing the remedial actions taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s legal determinations and remedial order.  The court rejected the argument that the \xe2\x80\x9cCommission\xe2\x80\x99s order unconstitutionally compels\xe2\x80\x9d Phillips and the shop \xe2\x80\x9cto convey a celebratory message about same sex marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc.</i>, 370 P.\xc2\xa03d 272, 283 (2015).  The court also rejected the argument that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order violated the Free Exercise Clause.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent in <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 879, the court stated that the Free Exercise Clause \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that following the law would interfere with religious practice or belief.  370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 289.  The court concluded that requiring Phillips to comply with the statute did not violate his free exercise rights.  The Colorado Supreme Court declined to hear the case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips sought review here, and this Court granted certiorari.  582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).  He now renews his claims under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the\n \nFirst Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.  For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights.  The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.  At the same time, the religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.  As this Court observed in <i>Obergefell</i> v. <i>Hodges</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFirst Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 27).  Nevertheless, while those religious and philosophical objections are protected, it is a general rule that such objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.  See <i>Newman</i> v. <i>Piggy Park Enterprises, Inc.</i>,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 402, n. 5 (1968) (<i>per curiam</i>); see also <i>Hurley</i> v. <i>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 572 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cProvisions like these are well within the State\xe2\x80\x99s usual power to enact when a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the target of discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the First or\n \nFourteenth Amendments\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion.  This refusal would be well understood in our constitutional order as an exercise of religion, an exercise that gay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment to their own dignity and worth.  Yet if that exception were not confined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and services for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay persons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure equal access to goods, services, and public accommodations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.  And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Petitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings, that would be a different matter and the State would have a strong case under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that went beyond any protected rights of a baker who offers goods and services to the general public and is subject to a neutrally applied and generally applicable public accommodations law.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x937, 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue is presented.  He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own voice and of his own creation.  As Phillips would see the case, this contention has a significant\n \nFirst Amendment speech component and implicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs.  In this context the baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the customers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to goods and services became a demand for him to exercise the right of his own personal expression for their message, a message he could not express in a way consistent with his religious beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 dilemma was particularly understandable given the background of legal principles and administration of the law in Colorado at that time.  His decision and his actions leading to the refusal of service all occurred in the year 2012.  At that point, Colorado did not recognize the validity of gay marriages performed in its own State.  See Colo. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa731 (2012); 370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 277.  At the time of the events in question, this Court had not issued its decisions either in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 744 (2013), or <i>Obergefell</i>.  Since the State itself did not allow those marriages to be performed in Colorado, there is some force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in deeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood to be an expression of support for their validity when that expression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at least insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and express a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to take place in another State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the time, state law also afforded storekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages the storekeeper considered offensive.  Indeed, while enforcement proceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado Civil Rights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving other bakers\xe2\x80\x99 creation of cakes, concluding on at least three occasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages.  See <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Gateaux, Ltd.</i>, Charge No. P20140071X (Mar. 24, 2015); <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Le Bakery Sensual, Inc.</i>, Charge No. P20140070X (Mar. 24, 2015); <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Azucar Bakery</i>, Charge No. P20140069X (Mar. 24, 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There were, to be sure, responses to these arguments that the State could make when it contended for a different result in seeking the enforcement of its generally applicable state regulations of businesses that serve the public.  And any decision in favor of the baker would have to be sufficiently constrained, lest all purveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons in effect be allowed to put up signs saying \xe2\x80\x9cno goods or services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages,\xe2\x80\x9d something that would impose a serious stigma on gay persons.  But, nonetheless, Phillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The neutral and respectful consideration to which Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however.  The Civil Rights Commission\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That hostility surfaced at the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s formal, public hearings, as shown by the record.  On May 30, 2014, the seven-member Commission convened publicly to consider Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case.  At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s business community.  One commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe \xe2\x80\x9cwhat he wants to believe,\xe2\x80\x9d but cannot act on his religious beliefs \xe2\x80\x9cif he decides to do business in the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 23.  A few moments later, the commissioner restated the same position: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a businessman wants to do business in the state and he\xe2\x80\x99s got an issue with the\xe2\x80\x94the law\xe2\x80\x99s impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 30.  Standing alone, these statements are susceptible of different interpretations.  On the one hand, they might mean simply that a business cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual orientation, regardless of the proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s personal views.  On the other hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive comments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 free exercise rights and the dilemma he faced.  In view of the comments that followed, the latter seems the more likely.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again.  This meeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record.  On this occasion another commissioner made specific reference to the previous meeting\xe2\x80\x99s discussion but said far more to disparage Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs.  The commissioner stated:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cI would also like to reiterate what we said in the hearing or the last meeting.  Freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust, whether it be\xe2\x80\x94I mean, we\xe2\x80\x94we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination.  And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to\xe2\x80\x94to use their religion to hurt others.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 11\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To describe a man\xe2\x80\x99s faith as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use\xe2\x80\x9d is to disparage his religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical\xe2\x80\x94something insubstantial and even insincere.  The commissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust.  This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination law\xe2\x80\x94a law that protects discrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual orientation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record shows no objection to these comments from other commissioners.  And the later state-court ruling reviewing the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s decision did not mention those comments, much less express concern with their content.  Nor were the comments by the commissioners disavowed in the briefs filed in this Court.  For these reasons, the Court cannot avoid the conclusion that these statements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case.  Members of the Court have disagreed on the question whether statements made by lawmakers may properly be taken into account in determining whether a law intentionally discriminates on the basis of religion.  See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520, 540\xe2\x80\x93542 (1993); <i>id.,</i> at 558 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In this case, however, the remarks were made in a very different context\xe2\x80\x94by an adjudicatory body deciding a particular case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another indication of hostility is the difference in treatment between Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case and the cases of other bakers who objected to a requested cake on the basis of conscience and prevailed before the Commission.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As noted above, on at least three other occasions the Civil Rights Division considered the refusal of bakers to create cakes with images that conveyed disapproval of same-sex marriage, along with religious text.  Each time, the Division found that the baker acted lawfully in refusing service.  It made these determinations because, in the words of the Division, the requested cake included \xe2\x80\x9cwording and images [the baker] deemed derogatory,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Gateaux, Ltd.</i>, Charge No. P20140071X, at 4; featured \xe2\x80\x9clanguage and images [the baker] deemed hateful,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Le Bakery Sensual, Inc.</i>, Charge No. P20140070X, at 4;  or displayed a message the baker \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed as discriminatory,  <i>Jack</i> v. <i>Azucar Bakery</i>, Charge No. P20140069X, at 4.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The treatment of the conscience-based objections at issue in these three cases contrasts with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 objection.  The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the theory that any message the requested wedding cake would carry would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker.  Yet the Division did not address this point in any of the other cases with respect to the cakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism.  Additionally, the Division found no violation of CADA in the other cases in part because each bakery was willing to sell other products, including those depicting Christian themes, to the prospective customers.  But the Commission dismissed Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to sell \xe2\x80\x9cbirthday cakes, shower cakes, [and] cookies and brownies,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 152, to gay and lesbian customers as irrelevant.  The treatment of the other cases and Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case could reasonably be interpreted as being inconsistent as to the question of whether speech is involved, quite apart from whether the cases should ultimately be distinguished.  In short, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious objection did not accord with its treatment of these other objections.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before the Colorado Court of Appeals, Phillips protested that this disparity in treatment reflected hostility on the part of the Commission toward his beliefs.  He argued that the Commission had treated the other bakers\xe2\x80\x99 conscience-based objections as legitimate, but treated his as illegitimate\xe2\x80\x94thus sitting in judgment of his religious beliefs themselves.  The Court of Appeals addressed the disparity only in passing and relegated its complete analysis of the issue to a footnote.  There, the court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his case is distinguishable from the Colorado Civil Rights Division\xe2\x80\x99s recent findings that [the other bakeries] in Denver did not discriminate against a Christian patron on the basis of his creed\xe2\x80\x9d when they refused to create the requested cakes.  370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 282, n.\xc2\xa08.  In those cases, the court continued, there was no impermissible discrimination because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Division found that the bakeries .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. refuse[d] the patron\xe2\x80\x99s request .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of the offensive nature of the requested message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A principled rationale for the difference in treatment of these two instances cannot be based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s own assessment of offensiveness.  Just as \xe2\x80\x9cno official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette</i>,\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 642 (1943), it is not, as the Court has repeatedly held, the role of the State or its officials to prescribe what shall be offensive.  See <i>Matal</i> v. <i>Tam</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2017) (opinion of Alito, J.) (slip op., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323).  The Colorado court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to account for the difference in treatment elevates one view of what is offensive over another and itself sends a signal of official disapproval of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s footnote does not, therefore, answer the baker\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the State\xe2\x80\x99s practice was to disfavor the religious basis of his objection.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons just described, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case violated the State\xe2\x80\x99s duty under the\n \nFirst Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, supra</i>, the Court made clear that the government, if it is to respect the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose regulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected citizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.  The Free Exercise Clause bars even \xe2\x80\x9csubtle departures from neutrality\xe2\x80\x9d on matters of religion.  <i>Id.</i>, at 534.  Here, that means the Commission was obliged under the Free Exercise Clause to proceed in a manner neutral toward and tolerant of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs.  The Constitution \xe2\x80\x9ccommits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 547.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Factors relevant to the assessment of governmental neutrality include \xe2\x80\x9cthe historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 540.  In view of these factors the record here demonstrates that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case was neither tolerant nor respectful of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs.  The Commission gave \xe2\x80\x9cevery appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 545, of adjudicating Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious objection based on a negative normative \xe2\x80\x9cevaluation of the particular justification\xe2\x80\x9d for his objection and the religious grounds for it.  <i>Id</i>., at 537.  It hardly requires restating that government has no role in deciding or even suggesting whether the religious ground for Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate.  On these facts, the Court must draw the inference that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious objection was not considered with the neutrality that the Free Exercise Clause requires.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While the issues here are difficult to resolve, it must be concluded that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest could have been weighed against Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed.  The official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners\xe2\x80\x99 comments\xe2\x80\x94comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by the State at any point in the proceedings that led to affirmance of the order\xe2\x80\x94were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s disparate consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case compared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.  For these reasons, the order must be set aside.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s hostility was inconsistent with the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.  Phillips was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who would give full and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of the circumstances in which this case was presented, considered, and decided.  In this case the adjudication concerned a context that may well be different going forward in the respects noted above.  However later cases raising these or similar concerns are resolved in the future, for these reasons the rulings of the Commission and of the state court that enforced the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order must be invalidated.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3910080">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p><p>_________________</p><p>No. 16\xe2\x80\x93111</p><p>_________________</p><p>MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, et\xc2\xa0al.</p><p>on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of colorado</p><p>[June 4, 2018]</p><p></p><p>Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p><p>I agree that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) violated Jack Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 right to freely exercise his religion.  As Justice Gorsuch explains, the Commission treated Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case differently from a similar case involving three other bakers, for reasons that can only be explained by hostility toward Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religion.  See <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x937 (concurring opinion).  The Court agrees that the Commission treated Phillips differently, and it points out that some of the Commissioners made comments disparaging Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religion.  See <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9316.  Although the Commissioners\xe2\x80\x99 comments are certainly disturbing, the discriminatory application of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law is enough on its own to violate Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 rights.  To the extent the Court agrees, I join its opinion.</p><p>While Phillips rightly prevails on his free-exercise claim, I write separately to address his free-speech claim.  The Court does not address this claim because it has some uncertainties about the record.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2.  Specifically, the parties dispute whether Phillips refused to create a <i>custom</i> wedding cake for the individual respondents, or whether he refused to sell them <i>any</i> wedding cake (including a premade one).  But the Colorado Court of Appeals resolved this factual dispute in Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 favor.  The court described his conduct as a refusal to \xe2\x80\x9cdesign and create a cake to celebrate [a] same-sex wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Craig </i>v. <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc.</i>, 370 P. 3d 272, 276 (2015); see also <i>id.,</i> at 286 (\xe2\x80\x9cdesigning and selling a wedding cake\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 283 (\xe2\x80\x9crefusing to create a wedding cake\xe2\x80\x9d).  And it noted that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order required Phillips to sell \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>any</i> product [he] would sell to heterosexual couples,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d including custom wedding cakes.  <i>Id.,</i> at 286 (emphasis added).</p><p>Even after describing his conduct this way, the Court of Appeals concluded that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was not expressive and was not protected speech.  It reasoned that an outside observer would think that Phillips was merely complying with Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law, not expressing a message, and that Phillips could post a disclaimer to that effect.  This reasoning flouts bedrock principles of our free-speech jurisprudence and would justify virtually any law that compels individuals to speak.  It should not pass without comment.</p><p>I</p><p>The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits state laws that abridge the \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  When interpreting this command, this Court has distinguished between regulations of speech and regulations of conduct.  The latter generally do not abridge the freedom of speech, even if they impose \xe2\x80\x9cincidental burdens\xe2\x80\x9d on expression.  <i>Sorrell</i> v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>,564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552, 567 (2011).  As the Court explains today, public-accommodations laws usually regulate conduct.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (citing <i>Hurley</i> v. <i>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 572 (1995)).  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general matter,\xe2\x80\x9d public-accommodations laws do not \xe2\x80\x9ctarget speech\xe2\x80\x9d but instead prohibit \xe2\x80\x9cthe <i>act</i> of discriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 572 (emphasis added).</p><p>Although public-accommodations laws generally regulate conduct, particular applications of them can burden protected speech.  When a public-accommodations law \xe2\x80\x9cha[s] the effect of declaring .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. speech itself to be the public accommodation,\xe2\x80\x9d the First Amendment applies with full force.  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 573; accord, <i>Boy Scouts of America </i>v. <i>Dale</i>,530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 640, 657\xe2\x80\x93659 (2000).

When this law required the sponsor of a St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day parade to include a parade unit of gay, lesbian, and bisexual Irish-Americans, the Court unanimously held that the law violated the sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s right to free speech.  Parades are \xe2\x80\x9ca form of expression,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court explained, and the application of the public-accommodations law \xe2\x80\x9calter[ed] the expressive content\xe2\x80\x9d of the parade by forcing the sponsor to add a new unit.  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568, 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  The addition of that unit compelled the organizer to \xe2\x80\x9cbear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9csuggest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that people of their sexual orientation have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexuals\xe2\x80\x9d; and imply that their participation \xe2\x80\x9cmerits celebration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 574.  While this Court acknowledged that the unit\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion might have been \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided, or even hurtful,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, it rejected the notion that governments can mandate \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts and statements acceptable to some groups or, indeed, all people\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cantithesis\xe2\x80\x9d of free speech, <i>id.,</i> at 579; accord, <i>Dale</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 660\xe2\x80\x93661.</p><p>The parade in <i>Hurley</i> was an example of what this Court has termed \xe2\x80\x9cexpressive conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 568\xe2\x80\x93569.  This Court has long held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution looks beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 569, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette</i>,319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 632 (1943).  Thus, a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconduct may be \xe2\x80\x98sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Texas</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 397, 404 (1989).  Applying this principle, the Court has recognized a wide array of conduct that can qualify as expressive, including nude dancing, burning the American flag, flying an upside-down American flag with a taped-on peace sign, wearing a military uniform, wearing a black armband, conducting a silent sit-in, refusing to salute the American flag, and flying a plain red flag.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>Of course, conduct does not qualify as protected speech simply because \xe2\x80\x9cthe person engaging in [it] intends thereby to express an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i>,391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367, 376 (1968).  To determine whether conduct is sufficiently expressive, the Court asks whether it was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to be communicative\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cin context, would reasona- bly be understood by the viewer to be communicative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Community for Creative Non-Violence</i>,468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288, 294 (1984).  But a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98particularized message\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is not required, or else the freedom of speech \xe2\x80\x9cwould never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Sch\xc3\xb6enberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hurley</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 569.</p><p>Once a court concludes that conduct is expressive, the Constitution limits the government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to restrict or compel it.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide \xe2\x80\x98what not to say\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctailor\xe2\x80\x9d the content of his message as he sees fit.  <i>Id.,</i> at 573 (quoting <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

Phillips considers himself an artist.  The logo for Masterpiece Cakeshop is an artist\xe2\x80\x99s paint palate with a paintbrush and baker\xe2\x80\x99s whisk.  Behind the counter Phillips has a picture that depicts him as an artist painting on a canvas.  Phillips takes exceptional care with each cake that he creates\xe2\x80\x94sketching the design out on paper, choosing the color scheme, creating the frosting and decorations, baking and sculpting the cake, decorating it, and delivering it to the wedding.  Examples of his creations can be seen on Masterpiece\xe2\x80\x99s website.  See http://masterpiececakes.com/wedding-cakes (as last visited June 1, 2018).</p><p>Phillips is an active participant in the wedding celebration.  He sits down with each couple for a consultation before he creates their custom wedding cake.  He discusses their preferences, their personalities, and the details of their wedding to ensure that each cake reflects the couple who ordered it.  In addition to creating and delivering the cake\xe2\x80\x94a focal point of the wedding celebration\xe2\x80\x94Phillips sometimes stays and interacts with the guests at the wedding.  And the guests often recognize his creations and seek his bakery out afterward.  Phillips also sees the inherent symbolism in wedding cakes.  To him, a wedding cake inherently communicates that \xe2\x80\x9ca wedding has occurred, a marriage has begun, and the couple should be celebrated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 162.</p><p>Wedding cakes do, in fact, communicate this message.  A tradition from Victorian England that made its way to America after the Civil War, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]edding cakes are so packed with symbolism that it is hard to know where to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Krondl, Sweet Invention: A History of Dessert 321 (2011) (Krondl); see also <i>ibid. </i>(explaining the symbolism behind the color, texture, flavor, and cutting of the cake).  If an average person walked into a room and saw a white, multi-tiered cake, he would immediately know that he had stumbled upon a wedding.  The cake is \xe2\x80\x9cso standardised and inevitable a part of getting married that few ever think to question it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Charsley, Interpretation and Custom: The Case of the Wedding Cake, 22 Man 93, 95 (1987).  Almost no wedding, no matter how spartan, is missing the cake.  See <i>id.,</i> at 98.  \xe2\x80\x9cA whole series of events expected in the context of a wedding would be impossible without it: an essential photograph, the cutting, the toast, and the distribution of both cake and favours at the wedding and afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Although the cake is eventually eaten, that is not its primary purpose.  See <i>id.,</i> at 95 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not unusual to hear people declaring that they do not like wedding cake, meaning that they do not like to eat it.  This includes people who are, without question, having such cakes for their weddings\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 97 (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is made of the eating itself\xe2\x80\x9d); Krondl 320\xe2\x80\x93321 (explaining that wedding cakes have long been described as \xe2\x80\x9cinedible\xe2\x80\x9d).  The cake\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to mark the beginning of a new marriage and to celebrate the couple.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>Accordingly, Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 creation of custom wedding cakes is expressive.  The use of his artistic talents to create a well-recognized symbol that celebrates the beginning of a marriage clearly communicates a message\xe2\x80\x94certainly more so than nude dancing,<i> Barnes</i> v. <i>Glen Theatre, Inc.</i>,501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 560, 565\xe2\x80\x93566 (1991), or flying a plain red flag, <i>Stromberg</i> v. <i>California</i>,283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 359, 369 (1931).[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  By forcing Phillips to create custom wedding cakes for same-sex weddings, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law \xe2\x80\x9calter[s] the expressive content\xe2\x80\x9d of his message.  <i>Hurley</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572.  The meaning of expressive conduct, this Court has explained, depends on \xe2\x80\x9cthe context in which it occur[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 405.  Forcing Phillips to make custom wedding cakes for same-sex marriages requires him to, at the very least, acknowledge that same-sex weddings are \xe2\x80\x9cweddings\xe2\x80\x9d and suggest that they should be celebrated\xe2\x80\x94the precise message he believes his faith forbids.  The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from requiring Phillips to \xe2\x80\x9cbear witness to [these] fact[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Hurley</i>, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 574, or to \xe2\x80\x9caffir[m] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a belief with which [he] disagrees,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 573.</p><p>B</p><p>The Colorado Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cnot sufficiently expressive\xe2\x80\x9d to be protected from state compulsion.  370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 283.  It noted that a reasonable observer would not view Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct as \xe2\x80\x9can endorsement of same-sex marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather as mere \xe2\x80\x9ccompliance\xe2\x80\x9d with Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 286\xe2\x80\x93287 (citing <i>Rumsfeld</i> v. <i>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47, 64\xe2\x80\x9365 (2006) (<i>FAIR</i>); <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819, 841\xe2\x80\x93842 (1995); <i>PruneYard Shopping Center</i> v. <i>Robins</i>,447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 74, 76\xe2\x80\x9378 (1980)).  It also emphasized that Masterpiece could \xe2\x80\x9cdisassociat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d itself from same-sex marriage by posting a \xe2\x80\x9cdisclaimer\xe2\x80\x9d stating that Colorado law \xe2\x80\x9crequires it not to discriminate\xe2\x80\x9d or that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision of its services does not constitute an endorsement.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 288.  This reasoning is badly misguided.</p><p>1</p><p>The Colorado Court of Appeals was wrong to conclude that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was not expressive because a reasonable observer would think he is merely complying with Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law.  This argument would justify any law that compelled protected speech.  And, this Court has never accepted it.  From the beginning, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s compelled-speech precedents have rejected arguments that \xe2\x80\x9cwould resolve every issue of power in favor of those in authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnette</i>, 319 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  <i>Hurley</i>, for example, held that the application of Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 public-accommodations law \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ed] [the organizers] to alter the expressive content of their parade.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.  It did not hold that reasonable observers would view the organizers as merely complying with Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 public-accommodations law.</p><p>The decisions that the Colorado Court of Appeals cited for this proposition are far afield.  It cited three decisions where groups objected to being forced to provide a forum for a third party\xe2\x80\x99s speech.  See <i>FAIR</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 51 (law school refused to allow military recruiters on campus); <i>Rosenberger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 822\xe2\x80\x93823 (public university refused to provide funds to a religious student paper); <i>PruneYard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 77 (shopping center refused to allow individuals to collect signatures on its property).  In those decisions, this Court rejected the argument that requiring the groups to provide a forum for third-party speech also required them to endorse that speech.  See <i>FAIR</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 63\xe2\x80\x9365; <i>Rosenberger</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 841\xe2\x80\x93842; <i>PruneYard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 85\xe2\x80\x9388.  But these decisions do not suggest that the government can force speakers to alter their <i>own</i> message.  See <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.</i>, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12 (\xe2\x80\x9cNotably absent from <i>PruneYard</i> was any concern that access .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might affect the shopping center owner\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of his own right to speak\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Hurley</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 580 (similar).</p><p>The Colorado Court of Appeals also noted that Masterpiece is a \xe2\x80\x9cfor-profit bakery\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9ccharges its customers.\xe2\x80\x9d  370 P. 3d, at 287.  But this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that a speaker\xe2\x80\x99s profit motive gives the government a freer hand in compelling speech.  See <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 8, 16 (collecting cases); <i>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</i> v. <i>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</i>,425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 748, 761 (1976) (deeming it \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond serious dispute\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peech .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is protected even though it is carried in a form that is \xe2\x80\x98sold\xe2\x80\x99 for profit\xe2\x80\x9d).  Further, even assuming that most for-profit companies prioritize maximizing profits over communicating a message, that is not true for Masterpiece Cakeshop.  Phillips routinely sacri- fices profits to ensure that Masterpiece operates in a way that represents his Christian faith.  He is not open on Sundays, he pays his employees a higher-than-average wage, and he loans them money in times of need.  Phillips also refuses to bake cakes containing alcohol, cakes with racist or homophobic messages, cakes criticizing God, and cakes celebrating Halloween\xe2\x80\x94even though Halloween is one of the most lucrative seasons for bakeries.  These efforts to exercise control over the messages that Masterpiece sends are still more evidence that Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct is expressive.  See <i>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>Tornillo</i>,418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 241, 256\xe2\x80\x93258 (1974); <i>Walker</i> v. <i>Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 15).</p><p>2</p><p>The Colorado Court of Appeals also erred by suggesting that Phillips could simply post a disclaimer, disassociating Masterpiece from any support for same-sex marriage.  Again, this argument would justify any law compelling speech.  And again, this Court has rejected it.  We have described similar arguments as \xe2\x80\x9cbeg[ging] the core question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Tornillo</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 256.  Because the government cannot compel speech, it also cannot \xe2\x80\x9crequire speakers to affirm in one breath that which they deny in the next.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.</i>, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 16; see also <i>id.,</i> at 15, n.\xc2\xa011 (citing <i>PruneYard</i>, 447 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 99 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).  States cannot put individuals to the choice of \xe2\x80\x9cbe[ing] compelled to affirm someone else\xe2\x80\x99s belief\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbe[ing] forced to speak when [they] would prefer to remain silent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 99.</p><p>III</p><p>Because Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 conduct (as described by the Colorado Court of Appeals) was expressive, Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s public-accommodations law cannot penalize it unless the law withstands strict scrutiny.  Although this Court sometimes reviews regulations of expressive conduct under the more lenient test articulated in <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i>,[<a href="#F4">4</a>] that test does not apply unless the government would have punished the conduct regardless of its expressive component.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Barnes</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 566\xe2\x80\x93572 (applying <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i> to evaluate the application of a general nudity ban to nude dancing); <i>Clark</i>, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 293 (applying <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien </i>to evaluate the application of a general camping ban to a demonstration in the park).  Here, however, Colorado would not be punishing Phillips if he refused to create any custom wedding cakes; it is punishing him because he refuses to create custom wedding cakes that express approval of same-sex marriage.  In cases like this one, our precedents demand \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the most exacting scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 412; accord, <i>Holder</i> v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 28 (2010).</p><p>The Court of Appeals did not address whether Colo- rado\xe2\x80\x99s law survives strict scrutiny, and I will not do so in the first instance.  There is an obvious flaw, however, with one of the asserted justifications for Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s law.  According to the individual respondents, Colorado can compel Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 speech to prevent him from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98denigrat[ing] the dignity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of same-sex couples, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assert[ing] [their] inferior- ity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and subjecting them to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98humiliation, frustration, and embarrassment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents Craig et\xc2\xa0al. 39 (quoting <i>J.

These justifications are completely foreign to our free-speech jurisprudence.</p><p>States cannot punish protected speech because some group finds it offensive, hurtful, stigmatic, unreasonable, or undignified.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 414.

It is hard to see how this statement stigmatizes gays and lesbians more than blocking them from marching in a city parade, dismissing them from the Boy Scouts, or subjecting them to signs that say \xe2\x80\x9cGod Hates Fags\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all of which this Court has deemed protected by the First Amendment.

Moreover, it is also hard to see how Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 statement is worse than the racist, demeaning, and even threatening speech toward blacks that this Court has tolerated in previous decisions.  Concerns about \xe2\x80\x9cdignity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstigma\xe2\x80\x9d did not carry the day when this Court affirmed the right of white supremacists to burn a 25-foot cross, <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>Black</i>,538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 343 (2003); conduct a rally on Martin Luther King Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, <i>Forsyth County</i> v. <i>Nationalist Movement</i>,505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123 (1992); or circulate a film featuring hooded Klan members who were brandishing weapons and threatening to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Bury the niggers,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Brandenburg</i> v. <i>Ohio</i>,395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 444, 446, n. 1 (1969) (<i>per curiam</i>).</p><p>Nor does the fact that this Court has now decided <i>Obergefell</i> v. <i>Hodges</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), somehow diminish Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 right to free speech.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is one thing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to conclude that the Constitution protects a right to same-sex marriage; it is something else to portray everyone who does not share [that view] as bigoted\xe2\x80\x9d and unentitled to express a different view.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 29).  This Court is not an authority on matters of conscience, and its decisions can (and often should) be criticized.

See Charsley, Interpretation and Custom: The Case of the Wedding Cake, 22 Man 93, 96 (1987).

But we know this with certainty: when the government fails to act neutrally toward the free exercise of religion, it tends to run into trouble.

As the Court explains, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission failed to act neutrally toward Jack Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s religious faith.  Maybe most notably, the Commission allowed three other bakers to refuse a customer\xe2\x80\x99s request that would have required them to violate their secular commitments.  Yet it denied the same accommodation to Mr. Phillips when he refused a customer\xe2\x80\x99s request that would have required him to violate his religious beliefs.  <i>Ante, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  As the Court also explains, the only reason the Commission seemed to supply for its discrimination was that it found Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs \xe2\x80\x9coffensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That kind of judgmental dismissal of a sincerely held religious belief is, of course, antithetical to the\n \nFirst Amendment and cannot begin to satisfy strict scrutiny.  The Constitution protects not just popular religious exercises from the condemnation of civil authorities.  It protects them all.  Because the Court documents each of these points carefully and thoroughly, I am pleased to join its opinion in full.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only wrinkle is this.  In the face of so much evidence suggesting hostility toward Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s sincerely held religious beliefs, two of our colleagues have written separately to suggest that the Commission acted neutrally toward his faith when it treated him differently from the other bakers\xe2\x80\x94or that it could have easily done so consistent with the\n \nFirst Amendment.  See <i>post, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and n.\xc2\xa04 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n. (Kagan, J., concurring).  But, respectfully, I do not see how we might rescue the Commission from its error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A full view of the facts helps point the way to the problem.  Start with William Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case.  He approached three bakers and asked them to prepare cakes with messages disapproving same-sex marriage on religious grounds.  App. 233, 243, 252.  All three bakers refused Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s request, stating that they found his request offensive to their secular convictions.  <i>Id.</i>, at 231, 241, 250.  Mr. Jack responded by filing complaints with the Colorado Civil Rights Division.  <i>Id.</i>, at 230, 240, 249.  He pointed to Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination against customers in public accommodations because of religious creed, sexual orientation, or certain other traits.  See <i>ibid.</i>; Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x80\x93601(2)(a) (2017).  Mr. Jack argued that the cakes he sought reflected his religious beliefs and that the bakers could not refuse to make them just because they happened to disagree with his beliefs.  App. 231, 241, 250.  But the Division declined to find a violation, reasoning that the bakers didn\xe2\x80\x99t deny Mr. Jack service because of his religious faith but because the cakes he sought were offensive to their own moral convictions.  <i>Id.</i>, at 237, 247, 255\xe2\x80\x93256.  As proof, the Division pointed to the fact that the bakers said they treated Mr. Jack as they would have anyone who requested a cake with similar messages, regardless of their religion.  <i>Id.</i>, at 230\xe2\x80\x93231, 240, 249<i>.  </i>The Division pointed, as well, to the fact that the bakers said they were happy to provide religious persons with other cakes expressing other ideas.  <i>Id.</i>, at 237, 247, 257.  Mr. Jack appealed to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, but the Commission summarily denied relief.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 326a\xe2\x80\x93331a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Next, take the undisputed facts of Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins approached Mr. Phillips about creating a cake to celebrate their wedding.  App. 168.  Mr. Phillips explained that he could not prepare a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding consistent with his religious faith.  <i>Id., </i>at 168\xe2\x80\x93169<i>.</i>  But Mr. Phillips offered to make other baked goods for the couple, including cakes celebrating other occasions.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Later, Mr. Phillips testified without contradiction that he would have refused to create a cake celebrating a same-sex marriage for any customer, regardless of his or her sexual orientation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 166\xe2\x80\x93167 (\xe2\x80\x9cI will not design and create wedding cakes for a same-sex wedding regardless of the sexual orientation of the customer\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the record reveals that Mr. Phillips apparently refused just such a request from Mr. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s mother.  <i>Id.,</i> at 38\xe2\x80\x9340, 169.  (Any suggestion that Mr. Phillips was willing to make a cake celebrating a same-sex marriage for a heterosexual customer or was not willing to sell other products to a homosexual customer, then, would simply mistake the undisputed factual record.  See <i>post,</i> at 4, n.\xc2\xa02 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n. (Kagan, J., concurring)).  Nonetheless, the Commission held that Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated the Colorado public accommodations law.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a\xe2\x80\x9358a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The facts show that the two cases share all legally sa- lient features.  In both cases, the effect on the customer was the same: bakers refused service to persons who bore a statutorily protected trait (religious faith or sexual orientation).  But in both cases the bakers refused service intending only to honor a personal conviction.  To be sure, the bakers <i>knew</i> their conduct promised the effect of leaving a customer in a protected class unserved.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication the bakers actually <i>intended</i> to refuse service <i>because of</i> a customer\xe2\x80\x99s protected characteristic.  We know this because all of the bakers explained without contradiction that they would not sell the requested cakes to anyone, while they would sell other cakes to members of the protected class (as well as to anyone else).  So, for example, the bakers in the first case would have refused to sell a cake denigrating same-sex marriage to an atheist customer, just as the baker in the second case would have refused to sell a cake celebrating same-sex marriage to a heterosexual customer.  And the bakers in the first case were generally happy to sell to persons of faith, just as the baker in the second case was generally happy to sell to gay persons.  In both cases, it was the kind of cake, not the kind of customer, that mattered to the bakers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The distinction between intended and knowingly accepted effects is familiar in life and law.  Often the purposeful pursuit of worthy commitments requires us to accept unwanted but entirely foreseeable side effects: so, for example, choosing to spend time with family means the foreseeable loss of time for charitable work, just as opting for more time in the office means knowingly forgoing time at home with loved ones.  The law, too, sometimes distinguishes between intended and foreseeable effects.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71.13, 2.02(2)(a)(i) (1985); 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa75.2(b), pp. 460\xe2\x80\x93463 (3d ed. 2018).  Other times, of course, the law proceeds differently, either conflating intent and knowledge or presuming intent as a matter of law from a showing of knowledge.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa78A (1965); <i>Radio Officers</i> v. <i>NLRB</i>,\n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 17, 45 (1954).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The problem here is that the Commission failed to act neutrally by applying a consistent legal rule.  In Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Commission chose to distinguish carefully between intended and knowingly accepted effects.  Even though the bakers knowingly denied service to someone in a protected class, the Commission found no violation because the bakers only intended to distance themselves from \xe2\x80\x9cthe offensive nature of the requested message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc.</i>, 370 P.\xc2\xa03d 272, 282, n.\xc2\xa08 (Colo. App. 2015); App. 237, 247, 256; App. to Pet. for Cert. 326a\xe2\x80\x93331a; see also Brief for Respondent Colorado Civil Rights Commission 52 (\xe2\x80\x9cBusinesses are entitled to reject orders for any number of reasons, including because they deem a particular product requested by a customer to be \xe2\x80\x98offensive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet, in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Commission dismissed this very same argument as resting on a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinction without a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a.  It concluded instead that an \xe2\x80\x9cintent to disfavor\xe2\x80\x9d a protected class of persons should be \xe2\x80\x9creadily .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. presumed\xe2\x80\x9d from the knowing failure to serve someone who belongs to that class.  <i>Id.,</i> at 70a.  In its judgment, Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s intentions were \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably tied to the sexual orientation of the parties involved\xe2\x80\x9d and essentially \xe2\x80\x9cirrational.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s opinions suggests any neutral principle to reconcile these holdings.  If Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s objection is \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably tied\xe2\x80\x9d to a protected class, then the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 objection in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case must be \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably tied\xe2\x80\x9d to one as well.  For just as cakes celebrating same-sex weddings are (usually) requested by persons of a particular sexual orientation, so too are cakes expressing religious opposition to same-sex weddings (usually) requested by persons of particular religious faiths.  In both cases the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 objection would (usually) result in turning down customers who bear a protected characteristic.  In the end, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s decisions simply reduce to this: it <i>presumed</i> that Mr. Phillip harbored an intent to discriminate against a protected class in light of the foreseeable effects of his conduct, but it declined to presume the same intent in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case even though the effects of the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct were just as foreseeable.  Underscoring the double standard, a state appellate court said that \xe2\x80\x9cno such showing\xe2\x80\x9d of actual \xe2\x80\x9canimus\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or intent to discriminate against persons in a protected class\xe2\x80\x94was even required in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case.  370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 282.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Commission cannot have it both ways.  The Commission cannot slide up and down the <i>mens rea</i> scale, picking a mental state standard to suit its tastes depending on its sympathies.  Either actual proof of intent to discriminate on the basis of membership in a protected class is required (as the Commission held in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case), or it is sufficient to \xe2\x80\x9cpresume\xe2\x80\x9d such intent from the knowing failure to serve someone in a protected class (as the Commission held in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case).  Perhaps the Commission could have chosen either course as an initial matter.  But the one thing it can\xe2\x80\x99t do is apply a more generous legal test to secular objections than religious ones.  See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,</i> 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 543\xe2\x80\x93544.  That is anything but the neutral treatment of religion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The real explanation for the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination soon comes clear, too\xe2\x80\x94and it does anything but help its cause.  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a case where the Commission self-consciously announced a change in its legal rule in all public accommodation cases.  Nor is this a case where the Commission offered some persuasive reason for its discrimination that might survive strict scrutiny.  Instead, as the Court explains, it appears the Commission wished to condemn Mr. Phillips for expressing just the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cirrational\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coffensive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. message\xe2\x80\x9d that the bakers in the first case refused to endorse.  <i>Ante, </i>at 16.  Many may agree with the Commission and consider Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs irrational or offensive.  Some may believe he misinterprets the teachings of his faith.  And, to be sure, this Court has held same-sex marriage a matter of constitutional right and various States have enacted laws that preclude discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  But it is also true that no bureaucratic judgment condemning a sincerely held religious belief as \xe2\x80\x9cirrational\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coffensive\xe2\x80\x9d will ever survive strict scrutiny under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  In this country, the place of secular officials isn\xe2\x80\x99t to sit in judgment of religious beliefs, but only to protect their free exercise.  Just as it is the \xe2\x80\x9cproudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence\xe2\x80\x9d that we protect speech that we hate, it must be the proudest boast of our free exercise jurisprudence that we protect religious beliefs that we find offensive.  See <i>Matal</i> v. <i>Tam</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 25) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Schwimmer</i>,\n\n279 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).  Popular religious views are easy enough to defend.  It is in protecting unpopular religious beliefs that we prove this country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to serving as a refuge for religious freedom.  See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, supra</i>, at 547; <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 707, 715\xe2\x80\x93716 (1981); <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder</i>,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205, 223\xe2\x80\x93224 (1972); <i>Cantwell</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i>,\n\n310 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, 308\xe2\x80\x93310 (1940).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor can any amount of after-the-fact maneuvering by our colleagues save the Commission.  It is no answer, for example, to observe that Mr. Jack requested a cake with text on it while Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins sought a cake celebrating their wedding without discussing its decoration, and then suggest this distinction makes all the difference.  See <i>post, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and n.\xc2\xa04 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  It is no answer either simply to slide up a level of generality to redescribe Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case as involving only a wedding cake like any other, so the fact that Mr. Phillips would make one for some means he must make them for all.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933, and n. (Kagan, J., concurring).  These arguments, too, fail to afford Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s faith neutral respect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take the first suggestion first.  To suggest that cakes with words convey a message but cakes without words do not\xe2\x80\x94all in order to excuse the bakers in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case while penalizing Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x94is irrational.  Not even the Commission or court of appeals purported to rely on that distinction.  Imagine Mr. Jack asked only for a cake with a symbolic expression against same-sex marriage rather than a cake bearing words conveying the same idea.  Surely the Commission would have approved the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 intentional wish to avoid participating in that message too.  Nor can anyone reasonably doubt that a wedding cake without words conveys a message.  Words or not and whatever the exact design, it celebrates a wedding, and if the wedding cake is made for a same-sex couple it celebrates a same-sex wedding.  See 370 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 276 (stating that Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins \xe2\x80\x9crequested that Phillips design and create a <i>cake</i> <i>to celebrate their same-sex wedding</i>\xe2\x80\x9d) (emphasis added).  Like \xe2\x80\x9can emblem or flag,\xe2\x80\x9d a cake for a same-sex wedding is a symbol that serves as \xe2\x80\x9ca short cut from mind to mind,\xe2\x80\x9d signifying approval of a specific \xe2\x80\x9csystem, idea, [or] institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette</i>,\n\n319 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624, 632 (1943).  It is precisely that approval that Mr. Phillips intended to withhold in keeping with his religious faith.  The Commission denied Mr. Phillips that choice, even as it afforded the bakers in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case the choice to refuse to advance a message they deemed offensive to their secular commitments.  That is not neutral.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor would it be proper for this or any court to suggest that a person must be forced to write words rather than create a symbol before his religious faith is implicated.  Civil authorities, whether \xe2\x80\x9chigh or petty,\xe2\x80\x9d bear no license to declare what is or should be \xe2\x80\x9corthodox\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to religious beliefs, <i>id.,</i> at 642, or whether an adherent has \xe2\x80\x9ccorrectly perceived\xe2\x80\x9d the commands of his religion, <i>Thomas, supra,</i> at 716.  Instead, it is our job to look beyond the formality of written words and afford legal protection to any sincere act of faith.  See generally<i> Hurley</i> v. <i>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 569 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution looks beyond written or spoken words as mediums of ex- pression,\xe2\x80\x9d which are \xe2\x80\x9cnot a condition of constitutional protection\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second suggestion fares no better.  Suggesting that this case is only about \xe2\x80\x9cwedding cakes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and not a wedding cake celebrating a same-sex wedding\xe2\x80\x94actually points up the problem.  At its most general level, the cake at issue in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case was just a mixture of flour and eggs; at its most specific level, it was a cake celebrating the same-sex wedding of Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins.  We are told here, however, to apply a sort of Goldilocks rule: describing the cake by its ingredients is <i>too general</i>; understanding it as celebrating a same-sex wedding is <i>too specific</i>; but regarding it as a generic wedding cake is <i>just right</i>.  The problem is, the Commission didn\xe2\x80\x99t play with the level of generality in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case in this way.  It didn\xe2\x80\x99t declare, for example, that because the cakes Mr. Jack requested were just cakes about weddings generally, and all such cakes were the same, the bakers had to produce them.  Instead, the Commission accepted the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 view that the specific cakes Mr. Jack requested conveyed a message offensive to their convictions and allowed them to refuse service.  Having done that there, it must do the same here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any other conclusion would invite civil authorities to gerrymander their inquiries based on the parties they prefer.  Why calibrate the level of generality in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case at \xe2\x80\x9cwedding cakes\xe2\x80\x9d exactly\xe2\x80\x94and not at, say, \xe2\x80\x9ccakes\xe2\x80\x9d more generally or \xe2\x80\x9ccakes that convey a message regarding same-sex marriage\xe2\x80\x9d more specifically?  If \xe2\x80\x9ccakes\xe2\x80\x9d were the relevant level of generality, the Commission would have to order the bakers to make Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s requested cakes just as it ordered Mr. Phillips to make the requested cake in his case.  Conversely, if \xe2\x80\x9ccakes that convey a message regarding same-sex marriage\xe2\x80\x9d were the relevant level of generality, the Commission would have to respect Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to make the requested cake just as it respected the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to make the cakes Mr. Jack requested.  In short, when the same level of generality is applied to both cases, it is no surprise that the bakers have to be treated the same.  Only by adjusting the dials <i>just right</i>\xe2\x80\x94fine-tuning the level of generality up or down for each case based solely on the identity of the parties and the substance of their views\xe2\x80\x94can you engineer the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, handing a win to Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s bakers but delivering a loss to Mr. Phillips.  Such results-driven reasoning is improper.  Neither the Commission nor this Court may apply a more specific level of generality in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case (a cake that conveys a message regarding same-sex marriage) while applying a higher level of generality in Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s case (a cake that  conveys no message regarding same-sex marriage).  Of course, under <i>Smith</i> a vendor cannot escape a public accommodations law just because his religion frowns on it.  But for any law to comply with the\n \nFirst Amendment and <i>Smith</i>, it must be applied in a manner that treats religion with neutral respect.  That means the government must apply the <i>same </i>level of generality across cases\xe2\x80\x94and that did not happen here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is another problem with sliding up the generality scale: it risks denying constitutional protection to religious beliefs that draw distinctions more specific than the government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred level of description.  To some, all wedding cakes may appear indistinguishable.  But <i>to Mr. Phillips</i> that is not the case\xe2\x80\x94his faith teaches him otherwise.  And his religious beliefs are entitled to no less respectful treatment than the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 secular beliefs in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case.  This Court has explained these same points \xe2\x80\x9c[r]epeatedly and in many different contexts\xe2\x80\x9d over many years.  <i>Smith</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 887.  For example, in <i>Thomas</i> a faithful Jehovah\xe2\x80\x99s Witness and steel mill worker agreed to help manufacture sheet steel he knew might find its way into armaments, but he was unwilling to work on a fabrication line producing tank turrets.  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 711.  Of course, the line Mr. Thomas drew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same many others would draw and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even the same line many other members of the same faith would draw.  Even so, the Court didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to suggest that making steel is just making steel.  Or that to offend his religion the steel needed to be of a particular kind or shape.  Instead, it recognized that Mr. Thomas alone was entitled to define the nature of his religious commitments\xe2\x80\x94and that those commitments, as defined by the faithful adherent, not a bureaucrat or judge, are entitled to protection under the\n \nFirst Amendment.  <i>Id.,</i> at 714\xe2\x80\x93716; see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lee</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252, 254\xe2\x80\x93255 (1982); <i>Smith</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 887 (collecting authorities).  It is no more appropriate for the United States Supreme Court to tell Mr. Phillips that a wedding cake is just like any other\xe2\x80\x94without regard to the religious significance his faith may attach to it\xe2\x80\x94than it would be for the Court to suggest that for all persons sacramental bread is <i>just</i> bread or a kippah is <i>just </i>a cap. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Only one way forward now remains.  Having failed to afford Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s religious objections neutral consideration and without any compelling reason for its failure, the Commission must afford him the same result it afforded the bakers in Mr. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The Court recognizes this by reversing the judgment below and holding that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order \xe2\x80\x9cmust be set aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 18.  Maybe in some future rulemaking or case the Commission could adopt a new \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d standard for all refusals of service and offer neutral reasons for doing so.  But, as the Court observes, \xe2\x80\x9c[h]owever later cases raising these or similar concerns are resolved in the future, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the rulings of the Commission and of the state court that enforced the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>this</i> case \xe2\x80\x9cmust be invalidated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Mr. Phillips has conclusively proven a\n \nFirst Amendment violation and, after almost six years facing unlawful civil charges, he is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3910078">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x93111</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of colorado</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 4, 2018]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a general rule that [religious and philosophical] objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 9.  But in upholding that principle, state actors cannot show hostility to religious views; rather, they must give those views \xe2\x80\x9cneutral and respectful consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 12.  I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full because I believe the Colorado Civil Rights Commission did not satisfy that obligation.  I write separately to elaborate on one of the bases for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court partly relies on the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate consideration of Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case compared to the cases of [three] other bakers\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cobjected to a requested cake on the basis of conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 14, 18.  In the latter cases, a customer named William Jack sought \xe2\x80\x9ccakes with images that conveyed disapproval of same-sex marriage, along with religious text\xe2\x80\x9d; the bakers whom he approached refused to make them.  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 15; see <i>post</i>, at 3 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (further describing the requested cakes).<b> </b> Those bakers prevailed before the Colorado Civil Rights Division and Commission, while Phillips\xe2\x80\x94who objected for religious reasons to baking a wedding cake for a same-sex couple\xe2\x80\x94did not.  The Court finds that the legal reasoning of the state agencies differed in significant ways as between the Jack cases and the Phillips case.  See <i>ante,</i> at 15.  And the Court takes especial note of the suggestion made by the Colorado Court of Appeals, in comparing those cases, that the state agencies found the message Jack requested \xe2\x80\x9coffensive [in] nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As the Court states, a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled rationale for the difference in treatment\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the government\xe2\x80\x99s own assessment of offensiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What makes the state agencies\xe2\x80\x99 consideration yet more disquieting is that a proper basis for distinguishing the cases was available\xe2\x80\x94in fact, was obvious.  The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) makes it unlawful for a place of public accommodation to deny \xe2\x80\x9cthe full and equal enjoyment\xe2\x80\x9d of goods and services to individuals based on certain characteristics, including sexual orientation and creed.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x80\x93601(2)(a) (2017).  The three bakers in the Jack cases did not violate that law.  Jack requested them to make a cake (one denigrating gay people and same-sex marriage) that they would not have made for any customer.  In refusing that request, the bakers did not single out Jack because of his religion, but instead treated him in the same way they would have treated anyone else\xe2\x80\x94just as CADA requires.  By contrast, the same-sex couple in this case requested a wedding cake that Phillips would have made for an opposite-sex couple.  In refusing that request, Phillips contravened CADA\xe2\x80\x99s demand that customers receive \xe2\x80\x9cthe full and equal enjoyment\xe2\x80\x9d of public accommodations irrespective of their sexual orientation.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The different outcomes in the Jack cases and the Phillips case could thus have been justified by a plain reading and neutral application of Colorado law\xe2\x80\x94untainted by any bias against a religious belief.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as fully consistent with that view.  The Court limits its analysis to the <i>reasoning</i> of the state agencies (and Court of Appeals)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cquite apart from whether the [Phillips and Jack] cases should ultimately be distinguished.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 15.  And the Court itself recognizes the principle that would properly account for a difference in <i>result</i> between those cases.  Colorado law, the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9ccan protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  For that reason, Colorado can treat a baker who discriminates based on sexual orientation differently from a baker who does not discriminate on that or any other prohibited ground.  But only, as the Court rightly says, if the State\xe2\x80\x99s decisions are not infected by religious hostility or bias.  I accordingly concur.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">*\xc2\xa0Justice Gorsuch disagrees.  In his view, the Jack cases and the Phillips case must be treated the same because the bakers in all those cases \xe2\x80\x9cwould not sell the requested cakes to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 4.  That description perfectly fits the Jack cases\xe2\x80\x94and explains why the bakers there did not engage in unlawful discrimination.  But it is a surprising characterization of the Phillips case, given that Phillips routinely sells wedding cakes to opposite-sex couples.  Justice Gorsuch can make the claim only because he does not think a \xe2\x80\x9cwedding cake\xe2\x80\x9d is the relevant product.  As Justice Gorsuch sees it, the product that Phillips refused to sell here\xe2\x80\x94and would refuse to sell to anyone\xe2\x80\x94was a \xe2\x80\x9ccake celebrating same-sex marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>post</i>, at 3, 6, 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But that is wrong.  The cake requested was not a special \xe2\x80\x9ccake celebrating same-sex marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was simply a wedding cake\xe2\x80\x94one that (like other standard wedding cakes) is suitable for use at same-sex and opposite-sex weddings alike.  See <i>ante</i>, at 4 (majority opinion) (recounting that Phillips did not so much as discuss the cake\xe2\x80\x99s design before he refused to make it).  And contrary to Justice Gorsuch\xe2\x80\x99s view, a wedding cake does not become something different whenever a vendor like Phillips invests its sale to particular customers with \xe2\x80\x9creligious significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 11.  As this Court has long held, and reaffirms today, a vendor cannot escape a public accommodations law because his religion disapproves selling a product to a group of customers, whether defined by sexual orientation, race, sex, or other protected trait.  See <i>Newman</i> v. <i>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.</i>,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400, 402, n.\xc2\xa05 (1968) (<i>per curiam</i>) (holding that a barbeque vendor must serve black customers even if he perceives such service as vindicating racial equality, in violation of his religious beliefs); <i>ante</i>, at 9.  A vendor can choose the products he sells, but not the customers he serves\xe2\x80\x94no matter the reason.  Phillips sells wedding cakes.  As to that product, he unlawfully discriminates: He sells it to opposite-sex but not to same-sex couples.  And on that basis\xe2\x80\x94which has nothing to do with Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs\xe2\x80\x94Colorado could have distinguished Phillips from the bakers in the Jack cases, who did not engage in any prohibited discrimination. </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3910081">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 16\xe2\x80\x93111</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of colorado</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 4, 2018]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is much in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion with which I agree.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a general rule that [religious and philosophical] objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  \xe2\x80\x9cColorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]urveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons [may not] put up signs saying \xe2\x80\x98no goods or services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.

In this regard, the Division observed that the bakeries regularly produced cakes and other baked goods with Christian symbols and had denied other customer requests for designs demeaning people whose dignity the Colorado Antidiscrimination Act (CADA) protects.  See <i>id.</i>, at 305a, 314a, 324a.  The Commission summarily affirmed the Division\xe2\x80\x99s no-probable-cause finding.

See also <i>ante, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x937 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  But the cases the Court aligns are hardly comparable.  The bakers would have refused to make a cake with Jack\xe2\x80\x99s requested message for any customer, regardless of his or her religion.  And the bakers visited by Jack would have sold him any baked goods they would have sold anyone else.  The bakeries\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to make Jack cakes of a kind they would not make for any customer scarcely resembles Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to serve Craig and Mullins: Phillips would <i>not</i> sell to Craig and Mullins, for no reason other than their sexual orientation, a cake of the kind he regularly sold to others.  When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding cake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating <i>their</i> wedding\xe2\x80\x94not a cake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings\xe2\x80\x94and that is the service Craig and Mullins were denied.  Cf. <i>ante, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Colorado, the Court does not gainsay, prohibits precisely the discrimination Craig and Mullins encountered.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1.  Jack, on the other hand, suffered no service refusal on the basis of his religion or any other protected characteristic.  He was treated as any other customer would have been treated\xe2\x80\x94no better, no worse.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The fact that Phillips might sell other cakes and cookies to gay and lesbian customers[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] was irrelevant to the issue Craig and Mullins\xe2\x80\x99 case presented.  What matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple.  In contrast, the other bakeries\xe2\x80\x99 sale of other goods to Christian customers was relevant: It shows that there were no goods the bakeries would sell to a non-Christian customer that they would refuse to sell to a Christian customer.  Cf. <i>ante, </i>at 15.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor was the Colorado Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdifference in treatment of these two instances .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. based on the government\xe2\x80\x99s own assessment of offensiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 16.  Phillips declined to make a cake he found offensive where the offensiveness of the product was determined solely by the identity of the customer requesting it.  The three other bakeries declined to make cakes where their objection to the product was due to the demeaning message the requested product would literally display.  As the Court recognizes, a refusal \xe2\x80\x9cto design a special cake with words or images .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might be different from a refusal to sell any cake at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 2.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The Colorado Court of Appeals did not distinguish Phillips and the other three bakeries based simply on its or the Division\xe2\x80\x99s finding that messages in the cakes Jack requested were offensive while any message in a cake for Craig and Mullins was not.  The Colorado court distinguished the cases on the ground that Craig and Mullins were denied service based on an aspect of their identity that the State chose to grant vigorous protection from discrimination.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a, n.\xc2\xa08 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Division found that the bakeries did not refuse [Jack\xe2\x80\x99s] request because of his creed, but rather because of the offensive nature of the requested message.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

I do not read the Court to suggest that the Colorado Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to include certain protected characteristics in CADA is an impermissible government prescription of what is and is not offensive.  Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  To repeat, the Court affirms that \xe2\x80\x9cColorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Statements made at the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s public hearings on Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case provide no firmer support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today.  Whatever one may think of the statements in historical context, I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins.  The proceedings involved several layers of independent decisionmaking, of which the Commission was but one.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a\xe2\x80\x936a.  First, the Division had to find probable cause that Phillips violated CADA.  Second, the ALJ entertained the parties\xe2\x80\x99 cross-motions for summary judgment.  Third, the Commission heard Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 appeal.  Fourth, after the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the Colorado Court of Appeals considered the case <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>.  What prejudice infected the determinations of the adjudicators in the case before and after the Commission?  The Court does not say.  Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 case is thus far removed from the only precedent upon which the Court relies, <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. </i>v.<i> Hialeah</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520 (1993), where the government action that violated a principle of religious neutrality implicated a sole decisionmaking body, the city council, see <i>id.,</i> at 526\xe2\x80\x93528.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, sensible application of CADA to a refusal to sell any wedding cake to a gay couple should occasion affirmance of the Colorado Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.

See <i>ante,</i> at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Nor could it, consistent with our\n \nFirst Amendment precedents.  Justice Thomas acknowledges that for conduct to constitute protected expression, the conduct must be reasonably understood by an observer to be communicative.  <i>Ante,</i> at 4 (citing <i>Clark </i>v. <i>Community for Creative Non-Violence</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288, 294 (1984)).  The record in this case is replete with Jack Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 own views on the messages he believes his cakes convey.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (describing how Phillips<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cconsiders\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csees\xe2\x80\x9d his work).  But Phillips submitted no evidence showing that an objective observer understands a wedding cake to convey a message, much less that the observer understands the message to be the baker\xe2\x80\x99s, rather than the marrying couple\xe2\x80\x99s.  Indeed, some in the wedding industry could not explain what message, or whose, a wedding cake conveys.  See Charsley, Interpretation and Custom: The Case of the Wedding Cake, 22 Man 93, 100\xe2\x80\x93101 (1987) (no explanation of wedding cakes\xe2\x80\x99 symbolism was forthcoming \xe2\x80\x9ceven amongst those who might be expected to be the experts\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 104\xe2\x80\x93105 (the cake cutting tradition might signify \xe2\x80\x9cthe bride and groom . . . as appropriating the cake\xe2\x80\x9d from the bride\xe2\x80\x99s parents).  And Phillips points to no case in which this Court has suggested the provision of a baked good might be expressive conduct.  Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 7, n.\xc2\xa02 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>Hurley </i>v. <i>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557, 568\xe2\x80\x93579 (1995) (citing previous cases recognizing parades to be expressive); <i>Barnes </i>v. <i>Glen Theatre, Inc.</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 560, 565 (1991) (noting precedents suggesting nude dancing is expressive conduct); <i>Spence </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405, 410 (1974) (observing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decades-long recognition of the symbolism of flags). </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The record provides no ideological explanation for the bakeries\xe2\x80\x99 refusals.

But what criticallydifferentiates them is the role the customer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily protected trait,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, played in the denial of service.  Change Craig and Mullins\xe2\x80\x99 sexual orientation (or sex), and Phillips would have provided the cake.  Change Jack\xe2\x80\x99s religion, and the bakers would have been no more willing to comply with his request.  The bakers\xe2\x80\x99 objections to Jack\xe2\x80\x99s cakes had nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x9creligious opposition to same-sex weddings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 6 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Instead, the bakers simply refused to make cakes bearing statements demeaning to people protected by CADA.

See <i>supra,</i> at 3.  Phillips did, therefore, discriminate <i>because of</i> sexual orientation; the other bakers did not discriminate <i>because of</i> religious belief; and the Commission properly found discrimination in one case but not the other.

But recall that, while Jack requested cakes with particular text inscribed, Craig and Mullins were refused the sale of any wedding cake at all.  They were turned away before any specific cake design could be discussed.  (It appears that Phillips rarely, if ever, produces wedding cakes with words on them\xe2\x80\x94or at least does not advertise such cakes.  See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Wedding, http://www.masterpiececakes.com/ wedding-cakes (as last visited June 1, 2018) (gallery with 31 wedding cake images, none of which exhibits words).)  The Division and the Court of Appeals could rationally and lawfully distinguish between a case involving disparaging text and images and a case involving a wedding cake of unspecified design.  The distinction is not between a cake with text and one without, see <i>ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Gorsuch, J., concurring); it is between a cake with a particular design and one whose form was never even discussed. </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
