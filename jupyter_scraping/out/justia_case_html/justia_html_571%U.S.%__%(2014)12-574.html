In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 funds were returned.  Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in Federal District Court in Nevada.  The District Court dismissed the suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada.

No part of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with that forum.  The Ninth Circuit reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical focus from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum to his contacts with respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself.  Respondents emphasize that they suffered the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d caused by the delayed return of their funds while residing in Nevada, but Calder made clear that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.  The proper question is whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claimed injury does not evince such a connection.  The injury occurred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to be when they desired to use the seized funds.

Because the defendant had no other contacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s con-tacts with the forum State cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive in determining whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights are violated,\xe2\x80\x9d Rush v. Savchuk,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n332 (1980)\n, we hold that the court in Nevada may not exercise personal jurisdiction under these circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner Anthony Walden serves as a police officer for the city of Covington, Georgia.  In August 2006, petitioner was working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as a deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  As part of a task force, petitioner conducted investigative stops and other law enforcement functions in support of the DEA\xe2\x80\x99s airport drug interdiction program.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Administration agents searched respondents Gina Fiore and Keith Gipson and their carry-on bags at the San Juan airport in Puerto Rico.  They found almost $97,000 in cash.  Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she and Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the El San Juan, and that they had residences in both California and Nevada (though they provided only California identification).  After respondents were cleared for departure, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport notified petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s task force in Atlanta that respondents had boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to catch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and another DEA agent approached them at the departure gate for their flight to Las Vegas.  In response to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were professional gamblers.  Respondents maintained that the cash they were carrying was their gambling \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bank\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and winnings.  App. 15, 24.  After using a drug-sniffing dog to perform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Petitioner advised respondents that their funds would be returned if they later proved a legitimate source for the cash.  Respondents then boarded their plane.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash to a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA headquarters.  The next day, petitioner received a phone call from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 attorney in Nevada seeking return of the funds.  On two occasions over the next month, petitioner also received documentation from the attorney regarding the legitimacy of the funds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped draft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of the funds and forwarded that affidavit to a United States Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Georgia.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  According to respondents, the affidavit was false and misleading because petitioner misrepresented the encounter at the airport and omitted exculpatory information regarding the lack of drug evidence and the legitimate source of the funds.  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned the funds to respondents in March 2007.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking money damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388 (1971)\n.  Respondents alleged that petitioner violated their\n \nFourth Amendment rights by (1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping the money after concluding it did not come from drug-related activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable cause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while knowing the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully seeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory informa-tion; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information from the United States Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The District Court granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Calder v. Jones,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 783 (1984)\n, the court determined that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in Georgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada.  The court concluded that even if petitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while knowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not confer jurisdiction.  Because the court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, it did not determine whether venue was proper.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals assumed the District Court had correctly determined that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s search and seizure in Georgia could not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada.  The court held, however, that the District Court could properly exercise jurisdiction over \xe2\x80\x9cthe false probable cause affidavit aspect of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  688 F.\xc2\xa03d 558, 577 (2011).  According to the Court of Appeals, petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly aimed\xe2\x80\x9d his submission of the allegedly false affidavit at Nevada by submitting the affidavit with knowledge that it would affect persons with a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant connection\xe2\x80\x9d to Nevada.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Id., at 581.  After determining that the delay in returning the funds to respondents caused them \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeable harm\xe2\x80\x9d in Nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over petitioner was otherwise reasonable, the court found the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of personal jurisdiction to be proper.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Id., at 582, 585.  The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with eight judges, in two separate opinions, dissenting.  Id., at 562, 568.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We granted certiorari to decide whether due process permits a Nevada court to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner.  568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  We hold that it does not and therefore reverse.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9cFederal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6).  This is because a federal district court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to assert personal jurisdiction in most cases is linked to service of process on a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwho is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed.

Here, Nevada has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction over persons \xe2\x80\x9con any basis not inconsistent with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the Constitution of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nev. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa714.065 (2011).  Thus, in order to determine whetherthe Federal District Court in this case was authorized to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner, we ask whether the exercise of jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9ccomports with the limits imposed by federal due process\xe2\x80\x9d on the State of Nevada.

World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 286,\n291 (1980)\n.  Although a nonresident\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is not required, the nonresident generally must have \xe2\x80\x9ccertain minimum contacts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  International Shoe Co. v.

Hustler Magazine, Inc.,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 770,\n775 (1984)\n (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner,\n\n433 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186,\n204 (1977)\n).  For a State to exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s suit-related conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.  Two related aspects of this necessary relationship are relevant in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant himself\xe2\x80\x9d creates with the forum State.  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462,\n475 (1985)\n.  Due process limits on the State\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicative authority principally protect the liberty of the nonresident defendant\xe2\x80\x94not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties.  See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 291\xe2\x80\x93292.  We have consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-focused \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry by demonstrating contacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the forum State.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\xc2\xa0A. v. Hall,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408,\n417 (1984)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[The] unilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an assertion of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have thus rejected a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a Florida court could exercise per-sonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on the contacts of the trust\xe2\x80\x99s settlor, who was domiciled in Florida and had executed powers of appointment there.  Hanson v. Denckla,\n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235\n\xe2\x80\x93254 (1958).  We have likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exercise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor that supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut dealers based only on an automobile purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s act of driving it on Oklahoma highways.  World-Wide Volks-wagen Corp., supra, at 298.  Put simply, however sig-nificant the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum may be, those contacts cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive in determining whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights are violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rush, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 332.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, our \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d analysis looks to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum State itself, not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with persons who reside there.  See, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations\xe2\x80\x9d); Hanson, supra, at 251 (\xe2\x80\x9cHowever minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the \xe2\x80\x98minimal contacts\xe2\x80\x99 with that State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants who have purposefully \xe2\x80\x9creach[ed] out beyond\xe2\x80\x9d their State and into another by, for example, entering a contractual relationship that \xe2\x80\x9cenvisioned continuing and wide-reaching contacts\xe2\x80\x9d in the forum State, Burger King, supra, at 479\xe2\x80\x93480, or by circulating magazines to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately exploi[t]\xe2\x80\x9d a market in the forum State, Keeton, supra, at 781.  And although physical presence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction, Burger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State\xe2\x80\x94either by the defendant in person or through an agent, goods, mail, or some other means\xe2\x80\x94is certainly a relevant contact.  See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773\xe2\x80\x93774.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum.  Rather, it is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct that must form the necessary connection with the forum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.  See Burger King, supra, at 478 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the question is whether an individual\xe2\x80\x99s contract with an out-of-state party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party\xe2\x80\x99s home forum, we believe the answer clearly is that it cannot\xe2\x80\x9d); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal., City and County of San Francisco,\n\n436 U.\xc2\xa0S. 84,\n93 (1978)\n (declining to \xe2\x80\x9cfind personal jurisdiction in a State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. merely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was residing there\xe2\x80\x9d).  To be sure, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum State may be intertwined with his transactions or interactions with the plaintiff or other parties.  But a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.  See Rush, supra, at 332 (\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with each other may be significant in evaluating their ties to the forum.  The requirements of International Shoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  Due process requires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum State based on his own affiliation with the State, not based on the \xe2\x80\x9crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\xe2\x80\x9d contacts he makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with the State.  Burger King, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 475 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        These same principles apply when intentional torts are involved.  In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts\xe2\x80\x9d or on the \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral activity\xe2\x80\x9d of a plaintiff.  Ibid. (same).  A forum State\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction over an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on intentional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary contacts with the forum.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Calder v. Jones,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 783\n, illustrates the application of these principles.  In Calder, a California actress brought a libel suit in California state court against a reporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the National Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s libel claims were based on an article written and edited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the National Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a California circulation of roughly 600,000.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We held that California\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of jurisdiction over the defendants was consistent with due process.  Although we recognized that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 activities \xe2\x80\x9cfocus[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d on the plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cfocuse[d] on \xe2\x80\x98the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 204).  Specifically, we examined the various contacts the defendants had created with California (and not just with the plaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defendants relied on phone calls to \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia sources\xe2\x80\x9d for the information in their article; they wrote the story about the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s activities in California; they caused reputa-tional injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous article that was widely circulated in the State; and the \xe2\x80\x9cbrunt\xe2\x80\x9d of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that State.  465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 788\xe2\x80\x93789.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn sum, California [wa]s the focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 789.  Jurisdiction over the defendants was \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore proper in California based on the \xe2\x80\x98effects\xe2\x80\x99 of their Florida conduct in California.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d of the alleged libel connected the defendants to California, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that connection was largely a function of the nature of the libel tort.  However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it can lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to (and read and understood by) third persons.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7577, Comment b (1976); see also ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eputation is the estimation in which one\xe2\x80\x99s character is held by his neighbors or associates\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the reputational injury caused by the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 story would not have occurred but for the fact that the defendants wrote an article for publication in California that was read by a large number of California citizens.  Indeed, because publication to third persons is a necessary element of libel, see id., \xc2\xa7558, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 intentional tort actually occurred in California.  Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the offending material is circulated\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this way, the \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d caused by the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 article\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the injury to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the estimation of the California public\xe2\x80\x94connected the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct to California, not just to a plaintiff who lived there.  That connection, combined with the various facts that gave the article a California focus, sufficed to authorize the California court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Applying the foregoing principles, we conclude that petitioner lacks the \xe2\x80\x9cminimal contacts\xe2\x80\x9d with Nevada that are a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him.  Hanson, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251.  It is undisputed that no part of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s course of conduct occurred in Nevada.  Petitioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents, and seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport.  It is alleged that petitioner later helped draft a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse probable cause affidavit\xe2\x80\x9d in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to a United States Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Georgia to support a potential action for forfeiture of the seized funds.   688 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 563.  Petitioner never traveled to, conducted activities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or anyone to Nevada.  In short, when viewed through the proper lens\xe2\x80\x94whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions connect him to the forum\xe2\x80\x94petitioner formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with Nevada.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by shifting the analytical focus from petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum to his contacts with respondents.  See Rush, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 332.  Rather than assessing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own contacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cstrong forum connections.\xe2\x80\x9d  688 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 577\xe2\x80\x93579, 581.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that respondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satisfied the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Id., at 582.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This approach to the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d analysis impermissibly allows a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the defendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient contacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed his conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections.  Such reasoning improperly attributes a plain-tiff\xe2\x80\x99s forum connections to the defendant and makes those connections \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive\xe2\x80\x9d in the jurisdictional analysis.  See Rush, supra, at 332.  It also obscures the reality that none of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they suffered the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury\xe2\x80\x9d caused by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly tortious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling funds) while they were residing in the forum.  Brief for Respondents 14.  This emphasis is likewise misplaced.  As previously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.  Regardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is jurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the defendant has formed a contact with the forum State.  The proper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a particular injury or effect but whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claimed injury does not evince a connection between petitioner and Nevada.  Even if we consider the continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct injury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada in any meaningful way.  Respondents (and only respondents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because anything independently occurred there, but because Nevada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they desired to use the funds seized by petitioner.  Respondents would have experienced this same lack of access in California, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have traveled and found themselves wanting more money than they had.  Unlike the broad publication of the forum-focused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s con-duct on respondents are not connected to the forum State in a way that makes those effects a proper basis forjurisdiction.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts with Nevada, each ultimately unavailing.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that is precisely the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral activity\xe2\x80\x9d of a third party that \xe2\x80\x9ccannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hanson, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253.  Respondents allege that some of the cash seized in Georgia \xe2\x80\x9coriginated\xe2\x80\x9d in Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created by petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada, when petitioner seized it.  Finally, the funds were eventually returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had nothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that it was respondents\xe2\x80\x99 unilateral decision to have their funds sent to Nevada).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are sufficient to decide this case.  The proper focus of the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum contacts\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry in intentional-tort cases is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Calder, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 788.  And it is the defendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must create contacts with the forum State.  In this case, the application of those principles is clear: Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s relevant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere fact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connectionsto the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdiction.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Respondents allege that the sniff test was \xe2\x80\x9cat best, inconclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d and there is no indication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue were ever found on or with the cash.
