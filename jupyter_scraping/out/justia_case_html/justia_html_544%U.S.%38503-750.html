He served five years in prison and then returned to the United States, where he bought a gun.  Federal authorities subsequently charged Small under 18 U.

Small pleaded guilty while reserving the right to challenge his conviction on the ground that his earlier conviction, being foreign, fell outside \xc2\xa7922(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The Federal District Court and the Third Circuit rejected this argument.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> Section 922(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses only domestic, not foreign, convictions.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x939.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In considering the scope of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d it is appropriate to assume that Congress had domestic concerns in mind.  This assumption is similar to the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application, see, <em>e.g., Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d describes one necessary portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cgun possession\xe2\x80\x9d activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.  Moreover, because foreign convictions may include convictions for conduct that domestic laws would permit, <em>e.g.,</em> for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage, convictions from a legal system that are inconsistent with American understanding of fairness, and convictions for conduct that domestic law punishes far less severely, the key statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d somewhat less reliably identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue.  In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.  To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations.  These considerations provide a convincing basis for applying the ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here.  Thus, the Court assumes a congressional intent that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d applies domestically, not extraterritorially, unless the statutory language, context, history, or purpose shows the contrary.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0There is no convincing indication to the contrary here.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language suggests no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language creates anomalies.  For example, in creating an exception allowing gun possession despite a conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime, \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)(A) speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State\xe2\x80\x9d antitrust or regulatory offenses.  If the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d generally refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.  But if the phrase includes foreign convictions, the words \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State\xe2\x80\x9d prevent the exception from applying where a <em>foreign</em> antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.  Such illustrative examples suggest that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d applies to foreign convictions.  Moreover, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history indicates no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  Although the statutory purpose of keeping guns from those likely to become a threat to society <em>does </em>offer some support for reading \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions, the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter is reinforced by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have fewer than a dozen instances in which such a foreign conviction has served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.

We hold that the phrase encompasses only domestic, not foreign, convictions.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1994 petitioner, Gary Small, was convicted in a Japanese court of having tried to smuggle several pistols, a rifle, and ammunition into Japan.  Small was sentenced to five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  183 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 755, 757, n. 3 (WD Pa. 2002).  After his release, Small returned to the United States, where he bought a gun from a Pennsylvania gun dealer.  Federal authorities subsequently charged Small under the \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful gun possession\xe2\x80\x9d statute here at issue.  333 F.\xc2\xa03d 425, 426 (CA3 2003).  Small pleaded guilty while reserving the right to challenge his conviction on the ground that his earlier conviction, being a foreign conviction, fell outside the scope of the illegal gun possession statute.  The Federal District Court rejected Small\xe2\x80\x99s argument, as did the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  183 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 759; 333 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 427, n.\xc2\xa02.  Because the Circuits disagree about the matter, we granted certiorari.  Compare <em>United States</em> v. <em>Atkins</em>, 872 F.\xc2\xa02d 94, 96 (CA4 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d includes foreign convictions); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Winson</em>, 793 F.\xc2\xa02d 754, 757\xe2\x80\x93759 (CA6 1986) (same), with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gayle</em>, 342 F.\xc2\xa03d 89, 95 (CA2 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d does not include foreign convictions); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Concha</em>, 233 F.\xc2\xa03d 1249, 1256 (CA10 2000) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether the statutory reference \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in <em>any </em>court\xe2\x80\x9d includes a conviction entered in a <em>foreign </em>court.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d considered alone cannot answer this question.

Thus, even though the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d demands a broad interpretation, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1997), we must look beyond that word itself.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining the scope of the statutory phrase we find help in the \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/197/index.html">507 U. S. 197</a>, 204, n.\xc2\xa05 (1993).  This notion has led the Court to adopt the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application.  See <em>Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285 (1949); see also<em> Palmer, supra</em>, at 631 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe words \xe2\x80\x98any person or persons,\xe2\x80\x99 are broad enough to comprehend every human being\xe2\x80\x9d but are \xe2\x80\x9climited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 249\xe2\x80\x93251 (1991).  That presumption would apply, for example, were we to consider whether this statute prohibits unlawful gun possession abroad as well as domestically.  And, although the presumption against extraterritorial application does not apply directly to this case, we believe a similar assumption is appropriate when we consider the scope of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, the phrase describes one necessary portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cgun possession\xe2\x80\x9d activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.  For another, considered as a group, foreign convictions differ from domestic convictions in important ways.  Past foreign convictions for crimes punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment may include a conviction for conduct that domestic laws would permit, for example, for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Art. 153 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, in<em> </em>Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure 171 (H. Berman &amp; J. Spindler transls. 2d ed. 1972) (criminalizing \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate Entrepreneurial Activity\xe2\x80\x9d); Art. 153,<em> id.,</em> at 172 (criminalizing \xe2\x80\x9cSpeculation,\xe2\x80\x9d which is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe buying up and reselling of goods or any other articles for the purpose of making a profit\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>e.g.</em>, Gaceta Oficial de la Republica de Cuba, ch. II, Art. 103, p. 68 (Dec. 30, 1987) (forbidding propaganda that incites against the social order, international solidarity, or the Communist State).  They would include a conviction from a legal system that is inconsistent with an American understanding of fairness.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, U. S. Dept. of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2003, Submitted to the House Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 702\xe2\x80\x93705, 1853, 2023 (Joint Comm. Print 2004) (describing failures of \xe2\x80\x9cdue process\xe2\x80\x9d and citing examples in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe testimony of one man equals that of two women\xe2\x80\x9d).  And they would include a conviction for conduct that domestic law punishes far less severely.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Singapore Vandalism Act, ch. 108, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72, 3, III Statutes of Republic of Singapore p. 258 (imprisonment for up to three years for an act of vandalism).  Thus, the key statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d somewhat less reliably identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.  To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations.  Cf.  1 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa74A1.2(h) (Nov. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]entences resulting from foreign convictions are not counted\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cprior sentence\xe2\x80\x9d for criminal history purposes).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations, suggesting significant differences between foreign and domestic convictions, do not dictate our ultimate conclusion.  Nor do they create a \xe2\x80\x9cclear statement\xe2\x80\x9d rule, imposing upon Congress a special burden of specificity.  See <em>post</em>, at 5 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  They simply convince us that we should apply an ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here\xe2\x80\x94an assumption that helps us determine Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent where Congress likely did not consider the matter and where other indicia of intent are in approximate balance.  Cf. <em>ibid.  </em>We consequently assume a congressional intent that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d applies domestically, not extraterritorially.  But, at the same time, we stand ready to revise this assumption should statutory language, context, history, or purpose show the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have found no convincing indication to the contrary here.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s language does not suggest any intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  Neither does it mention foreign convictions nor is its subject matter special, say, immigration or terrorism, where one could argue that foreign convictions would seem especially relevant.  To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language creates anomalies.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the statute creates an exception that allows gun possession despite a prior conviction for\nan antitrust or business regulatory crime.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(20)(A).  In doing so, the exception speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State\xe2\x80\x9d antitrust or regulatory offenses.  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d generally refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.  But if \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d includes foreign convictions, the words \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State\xe2\x80\x9d prevent the exception from applying where a <em>foreign</em> antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.  An individual convicted of, say, a Canadian antitrust offense could not lawfully possess a gun, Combines Investigation Act, 2 R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. 1985, ch. C\xe2\x80\x9334, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa761(6), (9) (1985), but a similar individual convicted of, say, a New York antitrust offense, could lawfully possess a gun.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the statute specifies that predicate crimes include \xe2\x80\x9ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(9).  Again, the language specifies that these predicate crimes include only crimes that are \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor[s] under Federal or State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A).  If \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem.  If the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates an apparently senseless distinction between (covered) domestic relations misdemeanors committed within the United States and (uncovered) domestic relations misdemeanors committed abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the statute provides an enhanced penalty where unlawful gun possession rests upon three predicate convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II).  Again the statute defines the relevant\ndrug crimes through reference to specific federal\ncrimes and with the words \xe2\x80\x9coffense under State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii) (2000).  If \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem.  But if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates an apparently senseless distinction between drug offenses committed within the United States (potentially producing enhanced punishments) and similar offenses committed abroad (not producing enhanced punishments).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the statute provides that offenses that are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to two years, and characterized under state law as misdemeanors, are not predicate crimes.  \xc2\xa7921(20).  This exception is presumably based on the determination that such state crimes are not sufficiently serious or dangerous so as to preclude an individual from possessing a firearm.  If \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem.  But if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates another apparently senseless distinction between less serious crimes (misdemeanors punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment) committed within the United States (not predicate crimes) and similar offenses committed abroad (predicate crimes).  These illustrative examples taken together suggest that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d applies to domestic as well as foreign convictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy legislative history confirms the fact that Congress did not consider whether foreign convictions should or should not serve as a predicate to liability under the provision here at issue.  Congress did consider a Senate bill containing language that would have restricted predicate offenses to domestic offenses.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 31 (1968) (defining predicate crimes in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal\xe2\x80\x9d crimes \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d and crimes \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined by the laws of the State to be a felony\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Conference Committee ultimately rejected this version in favor of language that speaks of those \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court, of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (1968).  But the history does not suggest that this language change reflected a congressional view on the matter before us. Rather, the enacted version is simpler and it avoids potential difficulties arising out of the fact that States may define the term \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d differently. And as far as the legislative history is concerned, these latter virtues of the new language fully explain the change.  Thus, those who use legislative history to help discern congressional intent will see the history here as silent, hence a neutral factor, that simply confirms the obvious, namely, that Congress did not consider the issue.  Others will not be tempted to use or to discuss the history at all.  But cf. <em>post</em>, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose <em>does </em>offer some support for a reading of the phrase that includes foreign convictions.  As the Government points out, Congress sought to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98keep guns out of the hands of those who have demonstrated that they may not be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a threat to society.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 16 (quoting <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>New Banner Institute, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/103/index.html">460 U.

See <em>supra,</em> at 4.  The statute itself and its history offer only congressional silence.  Given the reasons for disfavoring an inference of extraterritorial coverage from a statute\xe2\x80\x99s total silence and our initial assumption against such coverage, see <em>supra,</em> at 5, we conclude that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to domestic courts, not to foreign courts.  Congress, of course, remains free to change this conclusion through statutory amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961809">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSMALL V.

Yet the majority decides that Small\xe2\x80\x99s gun possession did not violate the statute, because his prior convictions occurred in a Japanese court rather than an American court.  In concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d means not what it says, but rather \xe2\x80\x9ca subset of any,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court distorts the plain meaning of the statute and departs from established principles of statutory construction.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 1992, Small shipped a 19-gallon electric water heater from the United States to Okinawa, Japan, ostensibly as a present for someone in Okinawa.

Small had sent two other water heaters to Japan that same year.  <em>Id.,</em> at 523a\xe2\x80\x93527a.  Thinking it unusual for a person to ship a water tank from overseas as a present, <em>id.,</em> at 599a, Japanese customs officials searched the heater and discovered 2 rifles, 8 semiautomatic pistols, and 410 rounds of ammunition.  <em>Id.,</em> at 603a\xe2\x80\x93604a; <em>id.,</em> at 262a, 267a, 277a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Japanese Government indicted Small on multiple counts of violating Japan\xe2\x80\x99s weapons-control and customs laws.  <em>Id.,</em> at 261a\xe2\x80\x93262a.

The broad phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany court\xe2\x80\x9d unambiguously includes all judicial bodies[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] with jurisdiction to impose the requisite conviction\xe2\x80\x94a conviction for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than a year.  Indisputably, Small was convicted in a Japanese court of crimes punishable by a prison term exceeding one year.  The clear terms of the statute prohibit him from possessing a gun in the United States.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany court,\xe2\x80\x9d like all other statutory language, must be read in context.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Deal</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/129/index.html">508 U. S. 129</a>, 132 (1993).  The context of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), however, suggests that there is no geographic limit on the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cany court.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  By contrast to other parts of the firearms-control law that expressly mention only state or federal law, \xe2\x80\x9cany court\xe2\x80\x9d is not qualified by jurisdiction.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7921(a)(20) (excluding certain \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State offenses\xe2\x80\x9d from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa7921(a)(33)(A)(i) (defining a \xe2\x80\x9cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to \xe2\x80\x9cFederal or State law\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 explicit use of \xe2\x80\x9cFederal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d in other provisions shows that it specifies such restrictions when it wants to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Counting foreign convictions, moreover, implicates no special federalism concerns or other clear statement rules that have justified construing \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d narrowly in the past.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And it is eminently practical to put foreign convictions to the same use as domestic ones; foreign convictions indicate dangerousness just as reliably as domestic convictions.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.  The expansive phrase \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any court\xe2\x80\x9d straightforwardly encompasses Small\xe2\x80\x99s Japanese convictions.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with the inescapably broad text, the Court narrows the statute by assuming that the text applies only to domestic convictions,<em> ante</em>, at 5; criticizing the accuracy of foreign convictions as a proxy for dangerousness, <em>ante,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x935; finding that the broad, natural reading of the statute \xe2\x80\x9ccreates anomalies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 5; and suggesting that Congress did not consider whether foreign convictions counted, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  None of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first invents a canon of statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x94what it terms \xe2\x80\x9can ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x94to cabin the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  This new \xe2\x80\x9cassumption\xe2\x80\x9d imposes a clear statement rule on Congress: Absent a clear statement, a statute refers to nothing outside the United States.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial that it has created a clear statement rule is implausible.  <em>Ibid.</em>  After today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the only way for Congress to ensure that courts will construe a law to refer to foreign facts or entities is to describe those facts or entities specifically as foreign.  If this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial burden of specificity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, I am not sure what is.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s innovation is baseless.  The Court derives its assumption from the entirely different, and well-recognized, canon against extraterritorial application of federal statutes: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 248 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the majority rightly concedes that the canon against extraterritoriality itself \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not apply directly to this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  Though foreign as well as domestic convictions trigger \xc2\xa7922(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition, the statute criminalizes gun possession in this country, not abroad.  In prosecuting Small, the Government is enforcing a domestic criminal statute to punish domestic criminal conduct.  <em>Pasquantino </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (federal wire fraud statute covers a domestic scheme aimed at defrauding a foreign government of tax revenue).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The extraterritoriality cases cited by the Court, <em>ante</em>, at 3, do not support its new assumption.  They restrict federal statutes from applying outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/197/index.html">507 U. S. 197</a>, 203\xe2\x80\x93204 (1993) (Federal Tort Claims Act does not apply to claims arising in Antarctica); <em>Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 249\xe2\x80\x93251 (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not regulate the employment practices of American firms employing American citizens abroad); <em>Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285\xe2\x80\x93286 (1949) (federal labor statute does not apply to a contract between the United States and a private contractor for construction work done in a foreign country); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Palmer,</em> 3 Wheat. 610, 630\xe2\x80\x93634 (1818) (statute punishing piracy on the high seas does not apply to robbery committed on the high seas by a noncitizen on board a ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state).  These straightforward applications of the extraterritoriality canon, restricting federal statutes from reaching conduct <em>beyond U. S. borders</em>, lend no support to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented rule restricting a federal statute from reaching conduct <em>within U. S. borders</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have, it is true, recognized that the presumption against extraterritorial application of federal statutes is rooted in part in the \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 204, n. 5.  But my reading of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) is entirely true to that notion: Gun possession in this country is surely a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic concern.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have also consistently grounded the canon in the risk that extraterritorially applicable U. S. laws could conflict with foreign laws, for example, by subjecting individuals to conflicting obligations.  <em>Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 248.  That risk is completely absent in applying \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) to Small\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  Quite the opposite, \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) takes foreign law as it finds it.  Aside from the extraterritoriality canon, which the Court properly concedes does not apply, I know of no principle of statutory construction justifying the result the Court reaches.  Its concession that the canon is inapposite should therefore end this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than stopping there, the Court introduces its new \xe2\x80\x9cassumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes\xe2\x80\x9d <em>sU. S.onte</em>, without briefing or argument on the point,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and without providing guidance on what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestically oriented statut[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  The majority suggests that it means all statutes except those dealing with subjects like \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration or terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, apparently reversing our previous rule that the extraterritoriality canon \xe2\x80\x9chas special force\xe2\x80\x9d in statutes \xe2\x80\x9cthat may involve foreign and military affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sale</em> v. <em>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/155/index.html">509 U. S. 155</a>, 188 (1993) (provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply extraterritorially); cf. <em>Palmer</em>, <em>supra</em> (statute criminalizing piracy on the high seas does not apply to robbery by noncitizen on ship belonging to foreign subjects).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s creation threatens to wreak havoc with the established rules for applying the canon against extraterritoriality.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of its narrow reading of the statute, the majority opines that the natural reading has inappropriate results.  It points to differences between foreign and domestic convictions, primarily attacking the reliability of foreign convictions as a proxy for identifying dangerous individuals.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935.  Citing various foreign laws, the Court observes that, if interpreted to include foreign convictions, \xc2\xa7922(g) would include convictions for business and speech activities \xe2\x80\x9cthat [United States] laws would permit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 3; convictions \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a legal system that is inconsistent with an American understanding of fairness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 4; and convictions \xe2\x80\x9cfor conduct that [United States] law punishes far less severely,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  The Court therefore concludes that foreign convictions cannot trigger \xc2\xa7922(g)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on firearm possession.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that foreign convictions punishable by imprisonment for more than a year \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat less reliably identif[y] dangerous individuals\xe2\x80\x9d than domestic convictions, <em>ibid.</em>, is untenable.  In compiling examples of foreign convictions that might trigger \xc2\xa7922(g)(1), <em>ibid.</em>, the Court constructs a parade of horribles.  Citing laws of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, Cuba, and Singapore, it cherry-picks a few egregious examples of convictions unlikely to correlate with dangerousness, inconsistent with American intuitions of fairness, or punishable more severely than in this country.  <em>Ibid.</em>  This ignores countless other foreign convictions punishable by more than a year that serve as excellent proxies for dangerousness and culpability.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Surely a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable human being\xe2\x80\x9d drafting this language would have considered whether foreign convictions are, on average and as a whole, accurate at gauging dangerousness and culpability, not whether the worst-of-the-worst are.  Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S.\xc2\xa0Cal. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 845, 854 (1992).  The Court also ignores the facts of this very case: A week after completing his sentence for shipping two rifles, eight semiautomatic pistols, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition into Japan, Small bought a gun in this country.  It was eminently reasonable for Congress to use convictions punishable by imprisonment for more than a year\xe2\x80\x94foreign no less than domestic\xe2\x80\x94as a proxy for dangerousness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, it makes sense to bar people convicted overseas from possessing guns in the United States.  The Court casually dismisses this point with the observation that only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9810 to a dozen\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d prosecutions under the statute have involved foreign convictions as predicate convictions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 32).  The rarity of such prosecutions, however, only refutes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous claim,<em> ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935, that a parade of horribles will result if foreign convictions count.  Moreover, the Court does not claim that any of these few prosecutions has been based on a foreign conviction inconsistent with American law.  As far as anyone is aware, the handful of prosecutions thus far rested on foreign convictions perfectly consonant with American law, like Small\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for international gunrunning.  The Court has no answer for why including foreign convictions is unwise, let alone irrational.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority worries that reading \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions \xe2\x80\x9ccreates anomalies\xe2\x80\x9d under other firearms control provisions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  It is true, as the majority notes, that the natural reading of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) affords domestic offenders more lenient treatment than foreign ones in some respects: A domestic antitrust or business regulatory offender could possess a gun, while a similar foreign offender could not; the perpetrator of a state misdemeanor punishable by two years or less in prison could possess a gun, while an analogous foreign offender could not.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In other respects, domestic offenders would receive harsher treatment than their foreign counterparts: One who committed a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in the United States could not possess a gun, while a similar foreign offender could; and a domestic drug offender could receive a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for unlawful gun possession, while a foreign drug offender could not.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These outcomes cause the Court undue concern.  They certainly present no occasion to employ, nor does the Court invoke, the canon against absurdities.  We should employ that canon only \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the result of applying the plain language would be, in a genuine sense, absurd, <em>i.e.</em>, where it is quite impossible that Congress could have intended the result . . . and where the alleged absurdity is so clear as to be obvious to most anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Public Citizen</em> v. <em>Department of Justice,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/440/index.html">491 U.

S. 125</a>, 141 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cavoidance of unhappy consequences\xe2\x80\x9d is inadequate basis for interpreting a text); cf. <em>Sturges</em> v. <em>Crowninshield,</em> 4 Wheat. 122, 203 (1819) (before disregarding the plain meaning of a constitutional provision, the case \xe2\x80\x9cmust be one in which the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case, would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the \xe2\x80\x9canomalies\xe2\x80\x9d to which the Court points are not absurd.  They are, at most, odd; they may even be rational.  For example, it is not senseless to bar a Canadian antitrust offender from possessing a gun in this country, while exempting a domestic antitrust offender from the ban.  Congress might have decided to proceed incrementally and exempt only antitrust offenses with which it was familiar, namely, domestic ones.  In any event, the majority abandons the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning based on results that are at most incongruous and certainly not absurd.  As with the extraterritoriality canon, the Court applies a mutant version of a recognized canon when the recognized canon is itself inapposite.  Whatever the utility of canons as guides to congressional intent, they are useless when modified in ways that Congress could never have imagined in enacting \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming that my reading of the statute generates anomalies, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading creates ones even more dangerous.  As explained above, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation permits those convicted overseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnaping, terrorism, and other dangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the United States.  <em>Supra</em>, at 9, and n. 7.  Meanwhile, a person convicted domestically of tampering with a vehicle identification number, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7511(a)(1), is barred from possessing firearms.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s concern with anomalies provides no principled basis for choosing its interpretation of the statute over mine.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court hypothesizes \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase \xe2\x80\x98convicted in any court\xe2\x80\x99 applies to domestic as well as foreign convictions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, and takes that as license to restrict the clear breadth of the text.  Whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s empirical assumption is correct is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  Regardless, we have properly rejected this method of guesswork-as-interpretation.  In <em>Beecham</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/368/index.html">511 U. S. 368</a> (1994), we interpreted other provisions of the federal firearms laws to mean that a person convicted of a federal crime is not relieved of the firearms disability unless his civil rights have been restored under federal (as opposed to state) law.  We acknowledged the possibility \xe2\x80\x9cthat the phrases on which our reading of the statute turns . . . were accidents of statutory drafting,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 374; and we observed that some legislators might have read the phrases differently from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, \xe2\x80\x9cor, more likely, . . . never considered the matter at all,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  We nonetheless adhered to the unambiguous meaning of the statute.  <em>Ibid.;</em> cf. <em>National Organization for Women, Inc.</em> v. <em>Scheidler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/249/index.html">510 U. S. 249</a>, 262 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that [the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.  It demonstrates breadth\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).  Here, as in <em>Beecham</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cour task is not the hopeless one of ascertaining what the legislators who passed the law would have decided had they reconvened to consider [this] particular cas[e],\xe2\x80\x9d 511 U. S., at 374, but the eminently more manageable one of following the ordinary meaning of the text they enacted.  That meaning includes foreign convictions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the absence of any discussion of foreign convictions in the legislative history is equally unconvincing.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Reliance on explicit statements in the history, if they existed, would be problematic enough.  Reliance on silence in the history is a new and even more dangerous phenomenon.  <em>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</em> v. <em>Nigh</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 5) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel \xe2\x80\x9cCanon of Canine Silence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not even agree, moreover, that the legislative history is silent.  As the Court describes, the Senate bill that formed the basis for this legislation was amended in Conference, to change the predicate offenses from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Federal\xe2\x80\x99 crimes\xe2\x80\x9d punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment and \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes \xe2\x80\x98determined by the laws of a State to be a felony\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to conviction \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in any court, of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  The Court seeks to explain this change by saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe enacted version is simpler and . . . avoids potential difficulties arising out of the fact that States may define the term \xe2\x80\x98felony\xe2\x80\x99 differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  But that does not explain why all limiting reference to \xe2\x80\x9cFederal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x9d was eliminated.  The revised provision would have been just as simple, and would just as well have avoided the potential difficulties, if it read \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted in any Federal or State court of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Surely that would have been the natural change if expansion beyond federal and state convictions were not intended.  The elimination of the limiting references suggests that not <em>only</em> federal and state convictions were meant to be covered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some, of course, do not believe that any statement or text that has not been approved by both Houses of Congress and the President (if he signed the bill) is an appropriate source of statutory interpretation.  But for those who do, this committee change ought to be strong confirmation of the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d means not \xe2\x80\x9cany Federal or State,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply \xe2\x80\x9cany.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court never convincingly explains its departure from the natural meaning of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  Instead, it institutes the troubling rule that \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d does not really mean \xe2\x80\x9cany,\xe2\x80\x9d but may mean \xe2\x80\x9csome subset of \xe2\x80\x98any,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d even if nothing in the context so indicates; it distorts the established canons against extraterritoriality and absurdity; it faults without reason Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of foreign convictions to gauge dangerousness and culpability; and it employs discredited methods of determining congressional intent.
