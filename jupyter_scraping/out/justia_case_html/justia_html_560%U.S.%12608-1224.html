S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74248.  The Government instituted civil-commitment proceedings under \xc2\xa74248 against respondents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, <em>inter alia,</em> that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18.  Agreeing, the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed on the legislative-power ground.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority sufficient to enact \xc2\xa74248.  Taken together, five considerations compel this conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in furtherance of its constitutionally enumerated powers.  It makes clear that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied by broad power to enact laws that are \xe2\x80\x9cconvenient, or useful\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconducive\xe2\x80\x9d to the enumerated power\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g., McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 418, and that Congress can \xe2\x80\x9clegislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved in the constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 421.  In determining whether the Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be \xe2\x80\x9cmeans-ends rationality\xe2\x80\x9d between the enacted statute and the source of federal power.  <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 605.  The Constitution \xe2\x80\x9caddresse[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cchoice of means\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily \xe2\x80\xa6 to the judgment of Congress.  If it can be seen that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burroughs</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/290/534/index.html">290 U. S. 534</a>, 547\xe2\x80\x93548.  Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifically enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority to do each of those things under the Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.<em> </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil commitment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74241\xe2\x80\x934247.  A longstanding history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U. S. 664</a>, 678, but can be \xe2\x80\x9chelpful in reviewing the substance of a congressional statutory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Raich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/1/index.html">545 U. S. 1</a>, 21, and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the new statute and pre-existing federal interests.  Section 4248 differs from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.  Many of these individuals, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under \xc2\xa74246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise).  The similarities between \xc2\xa74246 and \xc2\xa74248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9314.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0There are sound reasons for \xc2\xa74248\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  The Federal Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose.  Moreover, \xc2\xa74248 is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably adapted\xe2\x80\x9d to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to act as a responsible federal custodian.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Darby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/index.html">312 U. S. 100</a>, 121.  Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them to \xe2\x80\x9chave serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74247(a)(6), would pose an especially high danger to the public if released.  And Congress could also have reasonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals would likely not<em> </em>be detained by the States if released from federal custody.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 desire to address these specific challenges, taken together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa74248 satisfies \xe2\x80\x9creview for means-end rationality,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sabri, supra,</em> at 605.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that \xc2\xa74248 violates the Tenth Amendment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area typically left to state control is rejected.  That Amendment does not \xe2\x80\x9creserve to the States\xe2\x80\x9d those powers that are \xe2\x80\x9cdelegated to the United States by the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d including the powers delegated by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  See, <em>e.g., New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a>, 159.  And \xc2\xa74248 does not \xe2\x80\x9cinvade\xe2\x80\x9d state sovereignty, but rather requires <em>accommodation</em> of state interests: Among other things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the federal prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cis domiciled or was tried\xe2\x80\x9d of his detention, \xc2\xa74248(d), and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the individual, which will prompt the individual\xe2\x80\x99s immediate transfer to State custody, \xc2\xa74248(d)(1).  In <em>Greenwood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html">350 U. S. 366</a>, 375\xe2\x80\x93376, the Court rejected a similar challenge to \xc2\xa74248\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above.  Because the version of the statute at issue in <em>Greenwood</em> was <em>less</em> protective of state interests than \xc2\xa74248, <em>a fortiori</em>, the current statute does not invade state interests.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(5)\xc2\xa0Section 4248 is narrow in scope.  The Court rejects respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority can be no more than one step removed from a specifically enumerated power.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McCulloch, supra</em>, at 417.  Nor will the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today confer on Congress a general \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a>, 618.  Section \xc2\xa74248 has been applied to only a small fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals already \xe2\x80\x9cin the custody of the\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Government, \xc2\xa74248(a).  Thus, far from a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral police power,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74248 is a reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison system.  See <em>New York, supra,</em> at 157.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due process, or any other constitutional rights.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74248.  We have previously examined similar statutes enacted under state law to determine whether they violate the Due Process Clause.  See <em>Kansas</em> v. <em>Hendricks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/346/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/346/index.html">521 U. S. 346</a>, 356\xe2\x80\x93358 (1997); <em>Kansas</em> v. <em>Crane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/407/index.html">534 U. S. 407</a> (2002).  But this case presents a different question.  Here we ask whether the Federal Government has the authority under Article I of the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment program or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a government \xe2\x80\x9cof enumerated powers.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  We conclude that the Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact \xc2\xa74248 as \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d the powers \xe2\x80\x9cvested by\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution in the Government of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa018.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal statute before us allows a district court to order the civil commitment of an individual who is currently \xe2\x80\x9cin the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74248, if that individual (1) has previously \xe2\x80\x9cengaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) currently \xe2\x80\x9csuffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cas a result of\xe2\x80\x9d that mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous to others,\xe2\x80\x9d in that \xe2\x80\x9che would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(a)(5)\xe2\x80\x93(6).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to detain such a person, the Government (acting through the Department of Justice) must certify to a federal district judge that the prisoner meets the conditions just described, <em>i.e.</em>, that he has engaged in sexually violent activity or child molestation in the past and that he suffers from a mental illness that makes him correspondingly dangerous to others.  \xc2\xa74248(a).  When such a certification is filed, the statute automatically stays the individual\xe2\x80\x99s release from prison, <em>ibid.</em>, thereby giving the Government an opportunity to prove its claims at a hearing through psychiatric (or other) evidence, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c), 4248(b).  The statute provides that the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cshall be represented by counsel\xe2\x80\x9d and shall have \xe2\x80\x9can opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d at the hearing \xe2\x80\x9cto testify, to present evidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross-examine\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(d), 4248(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Government proves its claims by \xe2\x80\x9cclear and convincing evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d the court will order the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment in \xe2\x80\x9cthe custody of the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x9d who must \xe2\x80\x9cmake all reasonable efforts to cause\xe2\x80\x9d the State where that person was tried, or the State where he is domiciled, to \xe2\x80\x9cassume responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74248(d); cf. <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, 944 F.\xc2\xa02d 334, 337 (CA7 1991).  If either State is willing to assume that responsibility, the Attorney General \xe2\x80\x9cshall release\xe2\x80\x9d the individual \xe2\x80\x9cto the appropriate official\xe2\x80\x9d of that State.  \xc2\xa74248(d).  But if, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding such efforts, neither such State will assume such responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General shall place the person for treatment in a suitable [federal] facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.; </em>cf. \xc2\xa74247(i)(A).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Confinement in the federal facility will last until either (1) the person\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition improves to the point where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appropriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be released; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be transferred to the custody of that State.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74248(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  The statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric and judicial review of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s case, including judicial hearings at the request of the confined person at six-month intervals.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(e)(1)(B), (h).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November and December 2006, the Government instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case.  Three of the five had previously pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography, see 507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n.\xc2\xa02 (2007); \xc2\xa72252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Vigil</em>, No. 1:99CR00509\xe2\x80\x93001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71153, 2243(a).  With respect to each of them, the Government claimed that the respondent was about to be released from federal prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to others.  App. 38\xe2\x80\x9340, 44\xe2\x80\x9352.  During that same time period, the Government instituted similar proceedings against the fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.  See <em>id., </em>at 41\xe2\x80\x9343; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Catron</em>, No. 04\xe2\x80\x93778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27, 2006); \xc2\xa74241(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil-commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds.  They claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause, and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments.  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 528.  They claimed that the statute denies them substantive due process and equal protection of the laws.  <em>Ibid.</em>  They claimed that it violates their procedural due process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerousness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And, finally, they claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, \xc2\xa78 of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.  507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, accepting two of the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims, granted their motion to dismiss.  It agreed with respondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id.,</em> at 551\xe2\x80\x93559 (citing <em>In re Winship</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/index.html">397 U. S. 358</a> (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers, 507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 530\xe2\x80\x93551.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on this latter, legislative-power ground.  551 F.\xc2\xa03d 274, 278\xe2\x80\x93284 (2009).  It did not decide the standard-of-proof question, nor did it address any of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 other constitutional challenges.  <em>Id.,</em> at 276, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its request, limited to the question of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78 of the Constitution.  Pet. for Cert. i.  Since then, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that same question, each deciding it in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor, thereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Volungus</em>, 595 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (CA1 2010); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Tom</em>, 565 F.\xc2\xa03d 497 (CA8 2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented is whether the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18, grants Congress authority sufficient to enact the statute before us.  In resolving that question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other provisions of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94such as the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x94do not prohibit civil commitment in these circumstances.  Cf. <em>Hendricks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/346/index.html"></a><a href="/us/521/346/index.html">521 U. S. 346</a>; <em>Addington</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/index.html">441 U. S. 418</a> (1979).  In other words, we assume for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated powers, may enact such a statute as well.  On that assumption, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress legislative power sufficient to enact \xc2\xa74248.  We base this conclusion on five considerations, taken together.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>First</em>, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress broad authority to enact federal legislation.  Nearly 200 years ago, this Court stated that the Federal \xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCulloch</em>, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of\xe2\x80\x9d those powers, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U.

We recognize that even a longstanding history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html">397 U.

In 1855 it established Saint Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital in the District of Columbia to provide treatment to \xe2\x80\x9cthe insane of the army and navy . . . and of the District of Columbia.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309.  In 1857 it provided for confinement at Saint Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s of any person within the District of Columbia who had been \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with [a] crime\xe2\x80\x9d and who was \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d or later became \xe2\x80\x9cinsane during the continuance of his or her sentence in the United States penitentiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x936, 11 Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1881).  In 1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes, Congress provided for civil commitment in federal facilities (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> persons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in <em>any</em> court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and who are or \xe2\x80\x9cshall become\xe2\x80\x9d insane \xe2\x80\x9cduring the term of their imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis added).  And in 1882 Congress provided for similar commitment of those \xe2\x80\x9c<em>charged</em>\xe2\x80\x9d with federal offenses who become \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d while in the \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States.  Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis added).  Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress created a national, federal civil-commitment program under which any person who was either charged with or convicted of any federal offense in any federal court could be confined in a federal mental institution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These statutes did not raise the question presented here, for they all provided that commitment in a federal hospital would end upon the completion of the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cterms\xe2\x80\x9d of federal \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d as set forth in the underlying criminal sentence or statute.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x933, 18 Stat. 252; see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569, 571 (1916).  But in the mid-1940\xe2\x80\x99s that proviso was eliminated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil-commitment system.  The Judicial Conference based its proposals upon what this Court has described as a \xe2\x80\x9clong study by a conspicuously able committee\xe2\x80\x9d (chaired by Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members included Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation \xe2\x80\x9cwith federal district and circuit judges\xe2\x80\x9d across the country as well as with the Department of Justice.  <em>Greenwood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/366/index.html">350 U.

The committee studied, among other things, the \xe2\x80\x9cserious problem faced by the Bureau of Prisons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no state will assume responsibility for their custody.\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment Accorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged with Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report), App. 73.  The committee provided examples of instances in which the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the problem of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98paranoid\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98threatening\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d individuals whom no State would accept.  <em>Id.,</em> at 9, App. 71.  And it noted that, in the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xperience,\xe2\x80\x9d States would not accept an \xe2\x80\x9cappreciable number\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cmental[ly] incompetent\xe2\x80\x9d individuals \xe2\x80\x9cnearing expiration\xe2\x80\x9d of their prison terms, because of their \xe2\x80\x9clack of legal residence in any State,\xe2\x80\x9d even though those individuals \xe2\x80\x9cought not . . . be at large because they constitute a menace to public safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (statement of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from Bennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee Report, App. 83\xe2\x80\x9388.  The committee, hence the Judicial Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact \xe2\x80\x9csome provision of law authorizing the continued confinement of such persons after their sentences expired.\xe2\x80\x9d  Committee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the Judicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.  See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74241\xe2\x80\x934243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74244\xe2\x80\x934248.  It provided for the civil commitment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally incompetent at any time after their arrest and before the expiration of their federal sentence, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74241, 4244, 4247\xe2\x80\x934248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74242, 4246, 4247.  With respect to an individual whose prison term is about to expire, it specified the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released he will probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property, or other interests of the United States, and that suitable arrangements for the custody and care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to \xe2\x80\xa6 the court for the district in which the prisoner is confined.  Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner to be examined \xe2\x80\xa6 and shall \xe2\x80\xa6 hold a hearing \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. If upon such hearing the court shall determine that the conditions specified above exist, the court may commit the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74247.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe precondition that the mentally ill individual\xe2\x80\x99s release would \xe2\x80\x9cprobably endanger the safety of the officers, the property, or other interests of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d was uniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his \xe2\x80\x9crelease would endanger the safety of persons, property or the public interest in general\xe2\x80\x94not merely the interests peculiar to the United States as such.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Curry</em>, 410 F.\xc2\xa02d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also <em>Royal</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 274 F.\xc2\xa02d 846, 851\xe2\x80\x93852 (CA10 1960).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes.  See Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74241\xe2\x80\x934247 (2006 ed.).  As relevant here, it altered the provision just discussed, regarding the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s danger to the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d to conform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpretation of that language, <em>i.e.</em>, it altered the language so as to authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to the other conditions, the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelease would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74246(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress also elaborated upon the required condition \xe2\x80\x9cthat suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise available\xe2\x80\x9d by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative placement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>supra,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  With these modifications, the statutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once they have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal crime.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74241(d), 4246; see also \xc2\xa74243(d).  They continue to provide for the <em>continued </em>civil commitment of those individuals when they are \xe2\x80\x9cdue for release\xe2\x80\x9d from federal custody because their \xe2\x80\x9csentence is about to expire.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74246.  And, as we have previously set forth, they establish various procedural and other requirements.  <em>E.g.</em>, \xc2\xa74247.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before us.  \xc2\xa7302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74248.  It differs from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.  Notably, many of these individuals were likely already subject to civil commitment under \xc2\xa74246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise).  But cf. H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93218, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa029 (2005).  Aside from its specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, \xc2\xa74248 is similar to the provisions first enacted in 1949.  Cf. \xc2\xa74246.  In that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework, which has been in place since 1855.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually dangerous persons who are already in federal custody, even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of their criminal sentence.  For one thing, the Federal Government is the custodian of its prisoners.  As federal custodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger federal prisoners may pose.

To the contrary, it requires <em>accommodation</em> of state interests: The Attorney General must inform the State in which the federal prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cis domiciled or was tried\xe2\x80\x9d that he is detaining someone with respect to whom those States may wish to assert their authority, and he must encourage those States to assume custody of the individual.  \xc2\xa74248(d).

Respondents contend that the States are nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9cpowerless to <em>prevent</em> the detention of their citizens under \xc2\xa74248, even if detention is contrary to the States\xe2\x80\x99 policy choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 11 (emphasis added).  But that is not the most natural reading of the statute, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74248(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(e), and the Solicitor General acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Federal Government would have no appropriate role\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to an individual covered by the statute once \xe2\x80\x9cthe transfer to State responsibility and State control has occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Greenwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html"></a><a href="/us/350/366/index.html">350 U. S. 366</a>, the Court rejected a challenge to the current statute\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, to the 1949 statute we described above,<em> supra,</em> at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The petitioners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that the statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.  See Brief for Petitioner in <em>Greenwood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18\xe2\x80\x9329.  But the Court rejected that argument.  See <em>Greenwood, supra,</em> at 375\xe2\x80\x93376.  And the version of the statute at issue in <em>Greenwood</em> was <em>less</em> protective of state interests than the current statute.  That statute authorized federal custody so long as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>suitable</em> arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d were \xe2\x80\x9cnot otherwise available\xe2\x80\x9d in a State or otherwise.  63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added).  Cf. Brief for Petitioner in <em>Greenwood, supra, </em>at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has really happened is that the Federal government has been dissatisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally incompetent who have been released by the Federal authorities\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, by contrast, as we have explained, \xc2\xa74248 requires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant States to take custody of the individual without inquiring into the \xe2\x80\x9csuitability\xe2\x80\x9d of their intended care or treatment, and to relinquish federal authority whenever a State asserts its own.  \xc2\xa74248(d).  Thus, if the statute at issue in <em>Greenwood</em> did not invade state interests, then, <em>a fortiori</em>, neither does \xc2\xa74248.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth</em>, the links between \xc2\xa74248 and an enumerated Article I power are not too attenuated.  Neither is the statutory provision too sweeping in its scope.  Invoking the cautionary instruction that we may not \xe2\x80\x9cpile inference upon inference\xe2\x80\x9d in order to sustain congressional action under Article\xc2\xa0I, <em>Lopez</em>, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority can be no more than one step removed from a specifically enumerated power.  See Brief for Respondents 21\xe2\x80\x9322; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But this argument is irreconcilable with our precedents.  Again, take <em>Greenwood </em>as an example.  In that case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was accused of robbing a United States Post Office.  350 U. S., at 369, 375.  The underlying enumerated Article I power was the power to \xe2\x80\x9cEstablish Post Offices and Post Roads.\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa07.  But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized in <em>McCulloch</em>, </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe power \xe2\x80\x98to establish post offices and post roads\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0is executed by the single act of <em>making</em> the establishment\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [F]rom this has been inferred the power and duty of <em>carrying</em> the mail along the post road, from one post office to another.  And, from this\xc2\xa0<em>implied</em> power, has <em>again</em> been inferred the right to <em>punish</em> those who steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd, as we have explained, from the implied power to punish we have <em>further</em> inferred both the power to imprison, see <em>supra,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and, in <em>Greenwood</em>, the federal civil-commitment power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multiple examples of similar reasoning.  For example, in <em>Sabri </em>we observed that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has authority under the Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys\xe2\x80\x9d and that it therefore \xe2\x80\x9chas corresponding authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9csiphoned off\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9ccorrupt public officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 605 (citation omitted).  We then further held that, in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress has the <em>additional </em>prophylactic power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the stolen funds have not been \xe2\x80\x9ctraceably skimmed from specific federal payments.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em>  Similarly, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/98/343/index.html">98 U. S. 343</a> (1879), we held that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in furtherance of Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls. 11\xe2\x80\x9313, to award \xe2\x80\x9cpensions to the wounded and disabled\xe2\x80\x9d soldiers of the armed forces and their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that implied power we further inferred the \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mplied power\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto pass laws to \xe2\x80\xa6 punish\xe2\x80\x9d anyone who fraudulently appropriated such pensions, <em>id.,</em> at 346.  See also <em>Stewart</em> v. <em>Kahn</em>, 11 Wall. 493, 506\xe2\x80\x93507 (1871).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power, and also the additional power to imprison people who violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the additional power to provide for the safe and reasonable management of those prisons, and the additional power to regulate the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 behavior even after their release.  See <em>post, </em>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, 17, n.\xc2\xa011.  Of course, each of those powers, like the powers addressed in <em>Sabri, Hall, </em>and <em>McCulloch,</em> is ultimately \xe2\x80\x9cderived from\xe2\x80\x9d an enumerated power, <em>Hall, supra,</em> at 345.  And, as the dissent agrees, that enumerated power is \xe2\x80\x9cthe enumerated power that justifies the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statute of conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 17, n.\xc2\xa011.  Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single specific enumerated power \xe2\x80\x9cthat justifies a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 12, in <em>all</em> cases because Congress relies on different enumerated powers (often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to enact its various federal criminal statutes, see<em> supra,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  But every such statute must itself be legitimately predicated on an enumerated power.  And the same enumerated power that justifies the creation of a federal criminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied federal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justifies civil commitment under \xc2\xa74248 as well.  See <em>supra,</em> at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  Thus, we must reject respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a single step between an enumerated power and an Act of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on Congress a general \xe2\x80\x9cpolice power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 618.  As the Solicitor General repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, \xc2\xa74248 is narrow in scope.  It has been applied to only a small fraction of federal prisoners.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (105 individuals have been subject to \xc2\xa74248 out of over 188,000 federal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, W. Sabol, H. West, &amp; M. Cooper, Prisoners in 2008, p.\xc2\xa08 (rev. Apr. 2010) (Table 8), online at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/p08.pdf/ (as visited May 4, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  And its reach is limited to individuals already \xe2\x80\x9cin the custody of the\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Government.  \xc2\xa74248(a); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Federal authority for \xc2\xa74248] has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on the fact that this person has entered the criminal justice system \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, the Solicitor General argues that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Federal Government would not have \xe2\x80\xa6 the power to commit a person who \xe2\x80\xa6 has been released from prison and whose period of supervised release is also completed.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 9.  Thus, far from a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral police power,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74248 is a reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison\nsystem.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, as we have previously acknowledged,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Federal Government undertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in two senses; first, because the Framers would not have conceived that <em>any</em> government would conduct such activities; and second, because the Framers would not have believed that the <em>Federal</em> Government, rather than the States, would assume such responsibilities.  Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution were phrased in language broad enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s role.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> New York</em>, 505 U. S., at 157.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in drafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through time.  As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years ago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of \xe2\x80\x9ca constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCulloch</em>, 4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We take these five considerations together.  They include: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause, (2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena, (3) the sound reasons for the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in light of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s custodial interest in safeguarding the public from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4) the statute\xe2\x80\x99s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the statute\xe2\x80\x99s narrow scope.  Taken together, these considerations lead us to conclude that the statute is a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others.  The Constitution consequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its application denies equal protection of the laws, procedural or substantive due process, or any other rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williamson</em> v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/483/index.html">348 U. S. 483</a>, 487\xe2\x80\x93488 (1955).  This formulation was in a case presenting a due process challenge and a challenge to a State\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of its own powers, powers not confined by the principles that control the limited nature of our National Government.  The phrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the issue before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The operative constitutional provision in this case is the Necessary and Proper Clause.  This Court has not held that the <em>Lee Optical </em>test, asking if \xe2\x80\x9cit might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct\xe2\x80\x9d an evil, is the proper test in this context.  Rather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, application of a \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d test should be at least as exacting as it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more so.  Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its opinion referring to \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d are predominantly Commerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.  See <em>ante, </em>at 6 (citing <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Raich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/1/index.html">545 U. S. 1</a> (2005); <em>Lopez, supra;</em> <em>Hodel</em> v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/264/index.html">452 U. S. 264</a>, 276 (1981)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is an important difference between the two questions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.  <em>Raich</em>, <em>Lopez</em>, and <em>Hodel</em> were all Commerce Clause cases.  Those precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not a mere conceivable rational relation, as in <em>Lee Optical</em>.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lopez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 557, n. 2 (quoting <em>Hodel</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)).  The rational basis referred to in the Commerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based on empirical demonstration.  While undoubtedly deferential, this may well be different from the rational-basis test as <em>Lee Optical </em>described it.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies on <em>Sabri, supra</em>, for its conclusion that a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans-ends rationality\xe2\x80\x9d is all that is required for a power to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  <em>Sabri </em>only refers to \xe2\x80\x9cmeans-ends rationality\xe2\x80\x9d in a parenthetical describing the holding in <em>McCulloch </em>v.<em> Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819); it certainly did not import the <em>Lee Optical </em>rational-basis test into this arena through such a parenthetical.  See <em>Sabri</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 612 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute can have a \xe2\x80\x98rational\xe2\x80\x99 connection to an enumerated power without being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated power\xe2\x80\x9d).  It should be remembered, moreover, that the spending power is not designated as such in the Constitution but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect taxes and other specified exactions in order, among other purposes, \xe2\x80\x9cto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa01; see <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Dole</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/203/index.html">483 U. S. 203</a>, 206 (1987).  The limits upon the spending power have not been much discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to the Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the analytic approach in those precedents should be respected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A separate concern stems from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of the Tenth Amendment.  <em>Ante, </em>at 16.  I had thought it a basic principle that the powers reserved to the States consist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remaining after taking account of powers granted to the National Government.  The Constitution delegates limited powers to the National Government and then reserves the remainder for the States (or the people), not the other way around, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis suggests.  And the powers reserved to the States are so broad that they remain undefined.  Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps imperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and the States alone.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is correct in one sense to say that if the National Government has the power to act under the Necessary and Proper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the States.  But the precepts of federalism embodied in the Constitution inform which powers are properly exercised by the National Government in the first place.  See <em>Lopez, </em>514 U. S., at 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also <em>McCulloch</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 421 (powers \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper Clause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is not one properly within the reach of federal power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to hold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on the exercise of congressional power are the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s express prohibitions.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the Tenth Amendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing from the federal system are of no import when defining the limits of the National Government\xe2\x80\x99s power, as it proceeds by first asking whether the power is within the National Government\xe2\x80\x99s reach, and if so it discards federalism concerns entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These remarks explain why the Court ignores important limitations stemming from federalism principles.  Those principles are essential to an understanding of the function and province of the States in our constitutional\nstructure.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted within its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the federal detention of prisoners does not endanger third parties.  Federal prisoners often lack a single home State to take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so it is incumbent on the National Government to act.  This obligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in tort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an unstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.  Having acted within its constitutional authority to detain the person, the National Government can acknowledge a duty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does not prejudice the States and their citizens.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would note, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does, that \xc2\xa74248 does not supersede the right and responsibility of the States to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil confinement.  The federal program in question applies only to those in federal custody and thus involves little intrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not a case in which the National Government demands that a State use its own governmental system to implement federal commands.  See <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a> (1997).  It is not a case in which the National Government relieves the States of their own primary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the safety and well being of their citizens.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrison</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/598/index.html">529 U. S. 598</a> (2000).  Nor is it a case in which the exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and duties traditionally committed to the State.  See <em>Lopez, supra</em>, at 580\xe2\x80\x93581 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of authority over a small class of persons already subject to the federal power.  Importantly, \xc2\xa74248(d) requires the Attorney General to release any civil detainee \xe2\x80\x9cto the appropriate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or was tried if such State will assume responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d providing a strong assurance that the proffered reason for the legislation\xe2\x80\x99s necessity is not a mere artifice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963255">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nUNITED STATES V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74248, in order to \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d powers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitution, see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from federal prisoners who suffer from \xe2\x80\x9ca serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder\xe2\x80\x9d and who, if released, would have \xe2\x80\x9cserious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(a)(5), (6), 4248(d).  Under this law, if neither the State of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was tried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustody, care, and treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Government is authorized to undertake that responsibility.  \xc2\xa74248(d).  The statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will assume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a dangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy federal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to any State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I entirely agree with the dissent that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Necessary and Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that \xe2\x80\x98carr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x99 one or more of the federal powers enumerated in the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 1,<em> </em>but \xc2\xa74248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary and proper means of carrying into execution the enumerated powers that support the federal criminal statutes under which the affected prisoners were convicted.  The Necessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional authority for most federal criminal statutes.  In other words, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congressional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of the powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and proper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do that it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the operation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal prison system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All of this has been recognized since the beginning of our country.  The First Congress enacted federal criminal laws,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] created federal law enforcement and prosecutorial positions,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] established a federal court system,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] provided for the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal crimes,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and gave United States marshals the responsibility of securing federal prisoners.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only additional question presented here is whether, in order to carry into execution the enumerated powers on which the federal criminal laws rest, it is also necessary and proper for Congress to protect the public from dangers created by the federal criminal justice and prison systems.  In my view, the answer to that question is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just as it is necessary and proper for Congress to provide for the apprehension of escaped federal prisoners, it is necessary and proper for Congress to provide for the civil commitment of dangerous federal prisoners who would otherwise escape civil commitment as a result of federal imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some years ago, a distinguished study group created by the Judicial Conference of the United States found that, in a disturbing number of cases, no State was willing to assume the financial burden of providing for the civil commitment of federal prisoners who, if left at large after the completion of their sentences, would present a danger to any communities in which they chose to live or visit.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html">350 U. S. 366</a>, 373\xe2\x80\x93374 (1956).  These federal prisoners, having been held for years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any State; it was a matter of speculation where they would choose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was enthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of civil commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Congress <em>carte blanche.</em>  Although the term \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely necessary\xe2\x80\x9d or indispensable, the term requires an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d link between a power conferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by Congress.  See <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).  And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce compliance with that limitation.  <em>Id</em>., at 423.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law in question here satisfies that requirement.  This is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court to think of a rational basis on which Congress might have perceived an attenuated link between the powers underlying the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil commitment provision.  Here, there is a substantial link to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional powers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress had the constitutional authority to enact 18 U.

In other words, no matter how \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d an Act of Congress may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything other than \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d one or more of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers.

During the State ratification debates, Anti-Federalists expressed concern that the Necessary and Proper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited power.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981).  Federalist supporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge, explaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any freestanding authority, but instead made explicit what was already implicit in the grant of each enumerated power.  Referring to the \xe2\x80\x9cpowers declared in the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander Hamilton noted that \xe2\x80\x9cit is <em>expressly</em> to execute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . authorizes the national legislature to pass all <em>necessary</em> and <em>proper</em> laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 33, at 245.  James Madison echoed this view, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sweeping clause . . . only extend[s] to the enumerated powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter Elliot).  Statements by delegates to the state ratification conventions indicate that this understanding was widely held by the founding generation.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 245\xe2\x80\x93246 (statement of George Nicholas) (\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose [the Necessary and Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every power, that they should have power to make laws to carry that power into execution; would that have increased their powers?

Indeed, it is clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments urging its constitutionality, that \xc2\xa74248 is aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence, not toward \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d any enumerated power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 587 (entitled \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual exploitation and violent crime\xe2\x80\x9d), \xc2\xa7102, <em>id.</em>, at 590 (statement of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the public from sex offenders\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (asserting the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>protect the public from harm</em> that might result upon these prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 release, even when that harm might arise from conduct that is <em>otherwise beyond the general regulatory powers of the federal government</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual offenders is certainly an important end.  Sexual abuse is a despicable act with untold consequences for the victim personally and society generally.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kennedy</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, 554 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s newly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s plain text or with two centuries of our precedents interpreting it.  It also raises more questions than it answers.  Must each of the five considerations exist before the Court sustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Necessary and Proper Clause authority?  What if the facts of a given case support a finding of only four considerations?  Or three?  And if three or four will suffice, <em>which</em> three or four are imperative?  At a minimum, this shift from the two-step <em>McCulloch</em> framework to this five-consideration approach warrants an explanation as to why <em>McCulloch </em>is no longer good enough and which of the five considerations will bear the most weight in future cases, assuming some number less than five suffices.

In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies, <em>McCulloch</em>\xe2\x80\x99s straightforward two-part<em> </em>test.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">a</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court describes Congress\xe2\x80\x99 lawmaking power under the Necessary and Proper Clause as \xe2\x80\x9cbroad,\xe2\x80\x9d relying on precedents that have upheld federal laws under the Clause after finding a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rationa[l]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d fit between the law and an enumerated power.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 605 (2004)).  It is true that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of latitude in selecting the means for \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d an end that is \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Jinks</em> v. <em>Richland County</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/456/index.html">538 U. S. 456</a>, 462\xe2\x80\x93463 (2003) (citing <em>McCulloch</em>, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421).  But in citing these cases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit between means and ends matters<em> </em>only if the end is in fact legitimate\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, only if it is one of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference owed to Congress in selecting means to further a legitimate end, the Court bypasses <em>McCulloch</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first step and<em> </em>fails carefully to examine whether the end served by \xc2\xa74248 is actually one of those powers.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x932, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">b</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, instead of asking the simple question of what enumerated power \xc2\xa74248 \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ies] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d at <em>McCulloch</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first step, the Court surveys other laws Congress has enacted and concludes that, because \xc2\xa74248 is related to those laws, the \xe2\x80\x9clinks\xe2\x80\x9d between \xc2\xa74248 and an enumerated power are not \xe2\x80\x9ctoo attenuated\xe2\x80\x9d; hence, \xc2\xa74248 is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Necessary and Proper Clause authority.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  This unnecessarily confuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme, would result in an unwarranted expansion of federal power.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed authority to \xe2\x80\x9ccriminalize conduct\xe2\x80\x9d that interferes with enumerated powers; to \xe2\x80\x9cimprison individuals who engage in that conduct\xe2\x80\x9d; to \xe2\x80\x9cenact laws governing [those] prisons\xe2\x80\x9d; and to serve as a \xe2\x80\x9ccustodian of its prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9, 14.  From this, the Court assumes that \xc2\xa74248 must also be a valid exercise of congressional power because it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonably adapted\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to <em>those</em> exercises of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 incidental\xe2\x80\x94and thus unenumerated\xe2\x80\x94authorities.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15 (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa74248 is \xe2\x80\x98reasonably adapted\xe2\x80\x99 to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to act as a responsible federal custodian\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)); <em>ante</em>, at 22 (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute is a \xe2\x80\x98necessary and proper\xe2\x80\x99 means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others\xe2\x80\x9d).  But that is not the question.  The Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact any law simply because it furthers <em>other laws</em> Congress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every federal statute \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ies] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d one or more of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s <em>enumerated </em>powers.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal sentence satisfy this test because each helps to \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d the enumerated powers that justify a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or conviction.  For example, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o establish Post Offices and post Roads,\xe2\x80\x9d Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 7, would lack force or practical effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact criminal laws \xe2\x80\x9cto punish those who steal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCulloch</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 417.  Similarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that prisoners could escape or demand their release on the grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined them.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Gamble</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/97/index.html">429 U. S. 97</a> (1976).  Civil detention under \xc2\xa74248, on the other hand, lacks any such connection to an enumerated power.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After focusing on the relationship between \xc2\xa74248 and several of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 implied powers, the Court finally concludes that the civil detention of a \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous person\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74248 carries into execution the enumerated power that justified that person\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or conviction in the first place.  In other words, the Court analogizes \xc2\xa74248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await trial.  But while those laws help to \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[y] into Execution\xe2\x80\x9d the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of criminal sanctions on the inmate, \xc2\xa74248 does not bear that essential characteristic for three reasons.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous person\xe2\x80\x9d contains no element relating to the subject\xe2\x80\x99s crime.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74247(a)(5)\xe2\x80\x93(6).  It thus does not require a federal court to find any connection between the reasons supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power with which that person\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conduct interfered.  As a consequence, \xc2\xa74248 allows a court to civilly commit an individual without finding that he was ever charged with or convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74248(a), (d).  That possibility is not merely hypothetical: The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals against whom \xc2\xa74248 proceedings have been brought fit this description.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Tr. of Oral Arg. 23\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, \xc2\xa74248 permits the term of federal civil commitment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence expires or the date on which the statute of limitations on an untried defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime has run.  The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a person at a time when the Government would lack jurisdiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that executes an enumerated power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute this Court upheld in <em>Greenwood</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html">350 U. S. 366</a> (1956), provides a useful contrast.  That statute authorized the Federal Government to exercise civil custody over a federal defendant declared mentally unfit to stand trial only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 368, n.\xc2\xa02 (quoting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74246 (1952 ed.)).  Thus, that statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cend\xe2\x80\x9d reasonably could be interpreted as preserving the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to enforce a criminal law against the accused.  Section 4248 (2006 ed.), however, authorizes federal detention of a person even <em>after</em> the Government loses the authority to prosecute him for a federal crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third, the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous person\xe2\x80\x9d relevant to \xc2\xa74248 does not require the court to find that the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumerated power in the future.  Although the Federal Government has no express power to regulate sexual violence generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscribing such conduct in special circumstances.  All of these statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a connection to one of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated powers\xe2\x80\x94such as interstate commerce, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa72252(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94or that limit the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has plenary authority, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa72243(a).  Section 4248, by contrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that the person is \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d and presents a risk \xe2\x80\x9cto others,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74247(a)(5).  It requires no evidence that this sexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way that interferes with a federal law that executes an enumerated power or in a geographic location over which Congress has plenary authority.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or conviction cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under \xc2\xa74248. </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remaining \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations\xe2\x80\x9d in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s five-part inquiry do not alter this conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, in a final attempt to analogize \xc2\xa74248 to laws that authorize the Federal Government to provide care and treatment to prisoners while they await trial or serve a criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement of Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government has a \xe2\x80\x9ccustodial interest\xe2\x80\x9d in its prisoners, <em>ante</em>, at 22, and, thus, a broad \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities\xe2\x80\x9d from the dangers they may pose,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] <em>ante</em>, at 14.  That citation is puzzling because federal authority derives from the Constitution, not the common law.  In any event, nothing in the Restatement suggests that a common-law custodian has the powers that Congress seeks here.  While the Restatement provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause \xe2\x80\x9cbodily harm to others,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7319, p. 129 (1963\xe2\x80\x931964), that duty terminates once the legal basis for custody expires:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa7315, at 122.</p>\n<p align="left">\nOnce the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s criminal jurisdiction over a prisoner ends, so does any \xe2\x80\x9cspecial relation[ship]\xe2\x80\x9d between the Government and the former prisoner.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this reason, I cannot agree with Justice Alito that \xc2\xa74248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the public from dangers created by the federal criminal justice and prison systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (concurring in judgment).  A federal criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d propensities are not \xe2\x80\x9ccreated by\xe2\x80\x9d the fact of his incarceration or his relationship with the federal prison system.  The fact that the Federal Government has the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of punishing him for a federal crime\xe2\x80\x94sex-related or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94does not provide the Government with the additional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that person.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court describes \xc2\xa74248 as a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest\xe2\x80\x9d expansion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedigree.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Yet even if the antiquity of a practice could serve as a substitute for its constitutionality\xe2\x80\x94and the Court admits that it cannot, <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94the Court overstates the relevant history.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 first foray into this general area occurred in 1855, when it established St. Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital to provide treatment to \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d persons in the military and the District of Columbia.  Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.  But Congress was acting pursuant to <em>enumerated</em> powers when it took this step.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 17 (granting Congress plenary authority over the District of Columbia); Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to \xe2\x80\x9cmake Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\xe2\x80\x9d).  This enactment therefore provides no support for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 claimed power to detain sexually dangerous persons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commitment of \xe2\x80\x9cinsane\xe2\x80\x9d persons charged with or convicted of a federal crime.  Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x936, 11 Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1881); Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330.  As the Court explains, however, these statutes did not authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the \xe2\x80\x9cterm\xe2\x80\x9d of federal \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x933, 18 Stat. 252; see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569, 570\xe2\x80\x93571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, \xc2\xa76, 46 Stat. 271, and thus shed no light on the question presented here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive regime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill persons in BOP custody.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74246, 4247 (1952 ed.).  This Court addressed that regime in <em>Greenwood</em>, but<em> </em>never endorsed the proposition that the Federal Government could rely on that statute to detain a person in the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing criminal sentence.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As already noted, <em>Greenwood </em>upheld the commitment of a federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial on the narrow ground that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s criminal jurisdiction over the defendant\xe2\x80\x94its \xe2\x80\x9cpower to prosecute for federal offenses\xe2\x80\x94[wa]s not exhausted,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cpersist[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9cpending indictment.\xe2\x80\x9d  350 U. S., at 375; see <em>supra</em>, at 16.  The Court was careful to state that <em>\xe2\x80\x9c[t]his</em> commitment, and therefore the legislation authorizing commitment <em>in</em> <em>the</em> <em>context</em> <em>of</em> <em>this</em> <em>case</em>, involve[d] an assertion of authority\xe2\x80\x9d within \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Greenwood</em>, 350 U. S., at 375<em> </em>(emphasis added).  But it painstakingly limited its holding to \xe2\x80\x9cthe narrow constitutional issue raised by th[at] order of commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The historical record thus supports the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s authority to detain a mentally ill person against whom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law.  But it provides no justification whatsoever for reading the Necessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power to authorize the detention of persons without a basis for federal criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding \xc2\xa74248\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States.  First, the Court and both concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the power to enact \xc2\xa74248 because a long period of federal incarceration might \xe2\x80\x9cseve[r]\xe2\x80\x9d a sexually dangerous prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclaim to \xe2\x80\x98legal residence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in any particular State, <em>ante</em>, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the prisoner without any \xe2\x80\x9chome State to take charge\xe2\x80\x9d of him upon release, <em>ante</em>, at 5 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); see <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that many federal prisoners, \xe2\x80\x9cas a result of lengthy federal incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any State\xe2\x80\x9d).  I disagree with the premise of that argument.  As an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional authority to \xe2\x80\x9ctake charge\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal prisoner released within their jurisdiction.  See Amdt. 10 (stating that powers not delegated to the Federal Government are \xe2\x80\x9creserved\xe2\x80\x9d to the States, and to the people).  In addition, the assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise that authority is, in my view, implausible.  The Government stated at oral argument that its \xe2\x80\x9cdefault position\xe2\x80\x9d is to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR \xc2\xa72.33(b) (2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue that a State has the power to refuse such a person domicile within its borders.  Thus, they appear to assume that, in the absence of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74248, a State would take no action when informed by the BOP that a sexually dangerous federal prisoner was about to be released within its jurisdiction.  In light of the plethora of state laws enacted in recent decades to protect communities from sex offenders,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite remote.  But even in the event a State made such a decision, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that decision, and its consequences, to the state government alone.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the Court submits that \xc2\xa74248 does not upset the balance of federalism or invade the States\xe2\x80\x99 reserved powers because it \xe2\x80\x9crequires accommodation of state interests\xe2\x80\x9d by instructing the Attorney General to release a committed person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried if that State wishes to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98assume . . . responsibility\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for him.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17 (quoting \xc2\xa74248(d))<em>.</em>  This right of first refusal is mere window dressing.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the usual course that the State does take responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d).  More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assurance that \xc2\xa74248 preserves the principle of dual sovereignty\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cletter and spirit\xe2\x80\x9d of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94as the Necessary and Proper Clause requires.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  <em>McCulloch</em>, 4 Wheat., at 421; <em>Printz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/898/index.html">521 U. S. 898</a>, 923\xe2\x80\x93924 (1997).  For once it is determined that Congress has the authority to provide for the civil detention of sexually dangerous persons, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cis acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay impose its will on the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gregory</em>, 501 U. S., at 460; see Art.\xc2\xa0VI, cl.\xc2\xa02.  Section 4248\xe2\x80\x99s right of first refusal is thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of legislative grace.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, 29 States appear as <em>amici </em>and argue that \xc2\xa74248 is constitutional.  They tell us that they do not object to Congress retaining custody of \xe2\x80\x9csexually dangerous persons\xe2\x80\x9d after their criminal sentences expire because the cost of detaining such persons is \xe2\x80\x9cexpensive\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94approximately $64,000 per year\xe2\x80\x94and these States would rather the Federal Government bear this expense.

By assigning the Federal Government power over \xe2\x80\x9ccertain enumerated objects only,\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution \xe2\x80\x9cleaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J.

Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest that the relationship between Congress\xe2\x80\x99 implied power to punish postal crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to satisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Instead, <em>McCulloch </em>directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumerated power \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to establish post offices and post roads.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to . . . punish those who rob [the mail] is not indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office and post road,\xe2\x80\x9d but is \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the beneficial exercise of th[at] power\xe2\x80\x9d).  More importantly, <em>McCulloch</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution one or more enumerated powers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 422 (upholding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 incorporation of a bank because it was a \xe2\x80\x9cmeans . . . to be employed only for the purpose of carrying into execution<em> the given powers</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); see <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United</em> <em>States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/600/index.html">541 U.

In addition, Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cbroad general powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lara</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/193/index.html">541 U.

Although the Necessary and Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact \xc2\xa74248, I do not rule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil commitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts committed in these jurisdictions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United</em> <em>States</em> v. <em>Cohen</em>, 733 F.\xc2\xa02d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a defendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institutionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity).  Although two of the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of criminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see <em>ante</em>, at 3; 507 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 522, 527, and n.\xc2\xa02 (EDNC 2007), that question is not presented here because \xc2\xa74248 does not make that fact essential to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s placement in civil detention.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court also cites <em>Youngberg</em> v. <em>Romeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/307/index.html">457 U. S. 307</a> (1982), but that case lends even less support than the Restatement.  In <em>Youngberg</em>, an inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his constitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his bed at the hospital infirmary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 310\xe2\x80\x93311.  In assessing that claim, this Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect <em>its</em> <em>residents</em>\xe2\x80\x9d from the danger of violence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 320 (emphasis added).  The Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to \xe2\x80\x9cnearby  (and other) communities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Moreover, the hospital<em> </em>was a <em>state</em> institution.  Nothing in <em>Youngberg </em>suggests that the Federal Government can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal jurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the surrounding community.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Federal law permits a sentencing court to order that a defendant be placed on a term of \xe2\x80\x9csupervised release\xe2\x80\x9d after his term of imprisonment is complete.  18 U.

Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals serving terms of \xe2\x80\x9csupervised release\xe2\x80\x9d does not derive from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crelationship\xe2\x80\x9d with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38, but from the original criminal sentence itself.  Supervised release thus serves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at sentencing.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The fact that Congress has the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for the apprehension of escaped federal prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>ante</em>, at 3 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment), does not change this conclusion.  That authority derives from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to vindicate the enumerated power with which the escaped defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction interfered, not a freestanding police power.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to detain a person in such circumstances.
