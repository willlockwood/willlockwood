Patten was also the debtor of Ladd for goods sold by him to Patten, who gave in evidence payments which exceeded the amount due upon the latter account, and which, if applied to the former account, would nearly if not entirely discharge that debt.

S. 320</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL, stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>It is a clear principle of law that a person owing money on two several accounts, as upon bond and simple contract, may elect to apply his payments to which account he pleases; but if he fails to make the application, the election passes from him to the creditor.  No principle is recollected which obliges the creditor to make this election immediately.  After having made it, he is bound by it, but until he makes it, he is free to credit either the bond or simple contract. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 8 U. S. 321</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Unquestionably circumstances may occur, and perhaps did occur in this case, which would be equivalent to the declaration of his election on the part of the debtor, and therefore the court was correct in instructing the jury that if it should be satisfied that the payments were understood to be made on account of the goods sold at vendue, they ought to apply them to the discharge of that account; but in declaring that the election, which they supposed to devolve on the plaintiff if the application of the money was not understood at the time by the parties, was lost if not immediately exercised, that court erred.</p>\n<p>Their judgment therefore must be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
