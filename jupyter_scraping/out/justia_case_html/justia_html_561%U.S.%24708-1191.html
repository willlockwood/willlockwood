NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD. et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931191.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 29, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 24, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">In 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank whose \xe2\x80\x9cordinary shares\xe2\x80\x9d are not traded on any exchange in this country, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquartered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages\xe2\x80\x94seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc.  In 2001, National had to write down the value of HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s assets, causing National\xe2\x80\x99s share prices to fall.  Petitioners, Australians who purchased National\xe2\x80\x99s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents\xe2\x80\x94National, HomeSide, and officers of both companies\xe2\x80\x94in Federal District Court for violation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  They claimed that HomeSide and its officers had manipulated financial models to make the company\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of this deception.  Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The District Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that concluded abroad.  The Second Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">Held:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit erred in considering \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).  What conduct \xc2\xa710(b) reaches is a merits question, while subject-matter jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9crefers to a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s power to hear a case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central Region</em>, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa to adjudicate the \xc2\xa710(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

S. 244</a>, 248 <em>(Aramco).</em>  When a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.  Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s silence about \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial application permitted the court to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern\xe2\x80\x9d whether Congress would have wanted the statute to apply.  This disregard of the presumption against extraterritoriality has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.  The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 was promulgated under \xc2\xa710(b), it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend beyond conduct encompassed by \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Hagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/642/index.html">521 U. S. 642</a>, 651.  Thus, if \xc2\xa710(b) is not extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.  On its face, \xc2\xa710(b) contains nothing to suggest that it applies abroad.  Contrary to the argument of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign commerce in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d see 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritoriality, <em>Aramco, supra, </em>at 251.  Nor does a fleeting reference, in \xc2\xa778b(2)\xe2\x80\x99s description of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, to the dissemination and quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities.  Nor does Exchange Act \xc2\xa730(b), which says that the Act does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cto any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the SEC \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent \xe2\x80\xa6 evasion of [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has extraterritorial application; the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s enabling regulations preventing \xe2\x80\x9cevasion\xe2\x80\x9d seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal a domestic violation.  The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor General also fails to account for \xc2\xa730(a), which explicitly provides for a specific extraterritorial application.  That provision would be quite superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to transactions on foreign exchanges\xe2\x80\x94and its limitation of that application to securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative.  There being no affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that \xc2\xa710(b) applies extraterritorially, it does not.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The domestic activity in this case\xe2\x80\x94Florida is where HomeSide and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and where some misleading public statements were made\xe2\x80\x94does not mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act.  It is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks <em>all</em> contact with United States territory.  In <em>Aramco</em>, for example, where the plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see 499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d of congressional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employment.  Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s focus is not on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and sales of securities in the United States.  Section 10(b) applies only to transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic transactions in other securities.  The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881, and by the fact that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements apply only to securities listed on national securities exchanges, \xc2\xa778<em>l</em>(a).  This focus is also strongly confirmed by \xc2\xa730(a) and (b).  Moreover, the Court rejects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason that <em>Aramco </em>rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probability of incompatibility with other countries\xe2\x80\x99 laws is so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign application \xe2\x80\x9cit would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 256.  Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a violation where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the United States.

Its Ordinary Shares\xe2\x80\x94what in America would be called \xe2\x80\x9ccommon stock\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are traded on the Australian Stock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities exchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States.  There are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, however, National\xe2\x80\x99s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which represent the right to receive a specified number of National\xe2\x80\x99s Ordinary Shares.  547 F.\xc2\xa03d 167, 168, and n. 1 (CA2 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The complaint alleges the following facts, which we accept as true.  In February 1998, National bought respondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing company headquartered in Florida.  HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s business was to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the administrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage payments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and Financial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)).  The rights to receive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can provide a valuable income stream.  See 2 The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman, M. Milgate, &amp; J. Eatwell eds. 1992).  How valuable each of the rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the mortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is due, terminating the need for servicing.  HomeSide calculated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by using valuation models designed to take this likelihood into account.  It recorded the value of its assets, and the numbers appeared in National\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From 1998 until 2001, National\xe2\x80\x99s annual reports and other public documents touted the success of HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s business, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National\xe2\x80\x99s managing director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race (HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris (HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive officer) did the same in public statements.  But on July 5, 2001, National announced that it was writing down the value of HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s assets by $450 million; and then again on September 3, by another $1.75 billion.  The prices of both Ordinary Shares and ADRs slumped.  After downplaying the July write-down, National explained the September write-down as the result of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing interest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinancings, <em>i.e.</em>, more early repayments of mortgages), other mistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the loss of goodwill.  According to the complaint, however, HomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior executive who is also a respondent here had manipulated HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s financial models to make the rates of early repayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mortgage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they really were.  The complaint also alleges that National and Cicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did nothing about it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and Brian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased National\xe2\x80\x99s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the write-downs.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto, and the three HomeSide executives in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for alleged violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778j(b) and 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935 (2009), promulgated pursuant to \xc2\xa710(b).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They sought to represent a class of foreign purchasers of National\xe2\x80\x99s Ordinary Shares during a specified period up to the September write-down.  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 169.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The District Court granted the motion on the former ground, finding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country were, \xe2\x80\x9cat most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall securities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re National Australia Bank Securities Litigation</em>, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on similar grounds.  The acts performed in the United States did not \xe2\x80\x9ccompris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 175\xe2\x80\x93176.  We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before addressing the question presented, we must correct a threshold error in the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  It considered the extraterritorial reach of \xc2\xa710(b) to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).  See 547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 177.  In this regard it was following Circuit precedent, see <em>Schoenbaum</em> v. <em>Firstbrook</em>, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d 215 (1968).  The Second Circuit is hardly alone in taking this position, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re CP Ships Ltd. Securities Litigation</em>, 578 F.\xc2\xa03d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); <em>Continental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd.</em> v. <em>Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.</em>, 592 F.\xc2\xa02d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But to ask what conduct \xc2\xa710(b) reaches is to ask what conduct \xc2\xa710(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9crefers to a tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cpower to hear a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Union Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central Region</em>, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 12) (quoting <em>Arbaugh</em> v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 514 (2006), in turn quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cotton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/625/index.html">535 U. S. 625</a>, 630 (2002)).  It presents an issue quite separate from the question whether the allegations the plaintiff makes entitle him to relief.  See <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Hood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/678/index.html">327 U. S. 678</a>, 682 (1946).  The District Court here had jurisdiction under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778aa[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] to adjudicate the question whether \xc2\xa710(b) applies to National\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute, petitioners ask us to remand.  We think that unnecessary.  Since nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on the mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule 12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion.  As we have done before in situations like this, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Romero </em>v. <em>International Terminal Operating Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/354/index.html">358 U. S. 354</a>, 359, 381\xe2\x80\x93384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegations state a claim.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is a \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding principle of American law \xe2\x80\x98that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 248 (1991) <em>(Aramco)</em> (quoting <em>Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285 (1949)).  This principle represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about a statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to legislate, see <em>Blackmer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/284/421/index.html">284 U. S. 421</a>, 437 (1932).  It rests on the perception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic, not foreign matters.  <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/197/index.html">507 U. S. 197</a>, 204, n.\xc2\xa05 (1993).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cunless there is the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed\xe2\x80\x9d to give a statute extraterritorial effect, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must presume it is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aramco</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted).<em> </em>The canon or presumption applies regardless of whether there is a risk of conflict between the American statute and a foreign law, see <em>Sale</em> v. <em>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/155/index.html">509 U. S. 155</a>, 173\xe2\x80\x93174 (1993).  When a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often recited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that, because the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterritorial application of \xc2\xa710(b), it was left to the court to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern\xe2\x80\x9d whether Congress would have wanted the statute to apply.  See 547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 170 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This disregard of the presumption against extraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Appeals panel in this case.  It has been repeated over many decades by various courts of appeals in determining the application of the Exchange Act, and \xc2\xa710(b) in particular, to fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects abroad.  That has produced a collection of tests for divining what Congress would have wanted, complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern District of New York had consistently concluded that, by reason of the presumption against extraterritoriality, \xc2\xa710(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underlying the violation occurred abroad.  See <em>Schoenbaum</em> v. <em>Firstbrook</em>, 268 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 385, 392 (1967) (citing <em>Ferraoli</em> v. <em>Cantor</em>, CCH Fed. Sec. L.\xc2\xa0Rep. \xc2\xb691615 (SDNY 1965) and <em>Kook</em> v. <em>Cran</em>g, 182 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)).  <em>Schoenbaum</em> involved the sale in Canada of the treasury shares of a Canadian corporation whose publicly traded shares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed on both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Invoking the presumption against extraterritoriality, the court held that \xc2\xa710(b) was inapplicable (though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).  268 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 391\xe2\x80\x93392, 393\xe2\x80\x93394.  The decision in <em>Schoenbaum </em>was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit opinion which held that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the usual presumption against extraterritorial application of legislation nor the specific language of [\xc2\xa7]30(b) show Congressional intent to preclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions regarding stocks traded in the United States which are effected outside the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schoenbaum</em>, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 206.  It sufficed to apply \xc2\xa710(b) that, although the transactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they affected the value of the common shares publicly traded in the United States.  See <em>id.,</em> at 208\xe2\x80\x93209.  Application of \xc2\xa710(b), the Second Circuit found, was \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to protect American investors,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 206.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit took another step with <em>Leasco Data Processing Equip. Corp.</em> v. <em>Maxwell</em>, 468 F.\xc2\xa02d 1326 (1972), which involved an American company that had been fraudulently induced to buy securities in England.  There, unlike in <em>Schoenbaum</em>, some of the deceptive conduct had occurred in the United States but the corporation whose securities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any domestic exchange.  <em>Leasco</em> said that the presumption against extraterritoriality apples only to matters over which the United States would not have prescriptive jurisdiction, 468 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1334.  Congress had prescriptive jurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this country, the language of the Act could be read to cover that conduct, and the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress had thought about the point,\xe2\x80\x9d it would have wanted \xc2\xa710(b) to apply.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1334\xe2\x80\x931337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With <em>Schoenbaum</em> and <em>Leasco</em> on the books, the Second Circuit had excised the presumption against extraterritoriality from the jurisprudence of \xc2\xa710(b) and replaced it with the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and hence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the statute to a given situation.  As long as there was prescriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit explained, whether to apply \xc2\xa710(b) even to \xe2\x80\x9cpredominantly foreign\xe2\x80\x9d transactions became a matter of whether a court thought Congress \xe2\x80\x9cwished the precious resources of United States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to them rather than leave the problem to foreign countries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bersch </em>v. <em>Drexel Firestone, Inc.</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 974, 985 (1975); see also <em>IIT</em> v. <em>Vencap, Ltd.</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d 1001, 1017\xe2\x80\x931018 (CA2 1975).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit had thus established that application of \xc2\xa710(b) could be premised upon either some effect on American securities markets or investors <em>(Schoenbaum)</em> or significant conduct in the United States <em>(Leasco).</em>  It later formalized these two applications into (1) an \xe2\x80\x9ceffects test,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or upon United States citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) a \xe2\x80\x9cconduct test,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the wrongful conduct occurred in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Berger</em>, 322 F.\xc2\xa03d 187, 192\xe2\x80\x93193 (CA2 2003).  These became the north star of the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa710(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to what Congress would have wished.  Indeed, the Second Circuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9can admixture or combination of the two often gives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United States involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by an American court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Itoba Ltd.</em> v. <em>Lep Group PLC</em>, 54 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 122 (1995).  The Second Circuit never put forward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.  As early as <em>Bersch</em>, it confessed that \xe2\x80\x9cif we were asked to point to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative history, that compelled these conclusions, we would be unable to respond,\xe2\x80\x9d 519 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 993.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As they developed, these tests were not easy to administer.  The conduct test was held to apply differently depending on whether the harmed investors were Americans or foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of losses to American investors abroad, it was enough that acts \xe2\x80\x9cof material importance\xe2\x80\x9d performed in the United States \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly contributed\xe2\x80\x9d to that result; whereas those acts must have \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly caused\xe2\x80\x9d the result when losses to foreigners abroad were at issue.  See<em> Bersch</em>, 519 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 993.  And \xe2\x80\x9cmerely preparatory activities in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d did not suffice \xe2\x80\x9cto trigger application of the securities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 992.  This required the court to distinguish between mere preparation and using the United States as a \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d for fraudulent activities in other countries.  <em>Vencap</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1017\xe2\x80\x931018.  But merely satisfying the conduct test was sometimes insufficient without \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some additional factor tipping the scales\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in favor of the application of American law.  <em>Interbrew</em> v. <em>Edperbrascan Corp.</em>, 23 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 425, 432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting <em>Europe &amp; Overseas Commodity Traders, S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Banque Paribas London</em>, 147 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 129 (CA2 1998)).  District courts have noted the difficulty of applying such vague formulations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>In\xc2\xa0re Alstom SA</em>, 406 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 346, 366\xe2\x80\x93385 (SDNY 2005).  There is no more damning indictment of the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d tests than the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s own declaration that \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence or absence of any single factor which was considered significant in other cases \xe2\x80\xa6 is not necessarily dispositive in future cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>IIT</em> v. <em>Cornfeld</em>, 619 F.\xc2\xa02d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach, though not its precise application.  Like the Second Circuit, they described their decisions regarding the extraterritorial application of \xc2\xa710(b) as essentially resolving matters of policy.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Kasser</em>, 548 F.\xc2\xa02d 109, 116 (CA3 1977); <em>Continental Grain</em>, 592 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 421\xe2\x80\x93422; <em>Grunenthal GmbH</em> v. <em>Hotz</em>, 712 F.\xc2\xa02d 421, 424\xe2\x80\x93425 (CA9 1983); <em>Kauthar SDN BHD</em> v. <em>Sternberg</em>, 149 F.\xc2\xa03d 659, 667 (CA7 1998).  While applying the same fundamental methodology of balancing interests and arriving at what seemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of vaguely related variations on the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d tests.  As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the circuits \xe2\x80\xa6 seem to agree that there are some transnational situations to which the antifraud provisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement appears to end at that point.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Id.,</em> at 665.  See also <em>id.,</em> at 665\xe2\x80\x93667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits and adopting yet another variation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of cases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.  In <em>Zoelsch</em> v. <em>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.</em>, 824 F.\xc2\xa02d 27, 32 (1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed that rather than courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdivining what \xe2\x80\x98Congress would have wished\xe2\x80\x99 if it had addressed the problem[, a] more natural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in fact thought about and conferred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although tempted to apply the presumption against extraterritoriality and be done with it, see <em>id.,</em> at 31\xe2\x80\x9332, that court deferred to the Second Circuit because of its \xe2\x80\x9cpreeminence in the field of securities law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 32.  See also <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>TCI/US West Communications Inc.</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa03d 900, 906\xe2\x80\x93907 (CA5 1997) (expressing agreement with <em>Zoelsch</em>\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the emphasis on policy considerations in some of the cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and inconsistent application of \xc2\xa710(b) to transnational cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Choi &amp; Silberman, Transnational Litigation and Global Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 465, 467\xe2\x80\x93468; Chang, Multinational Enforcement of U. S. Securities Laws: The Need for the Clear and Restrained Scope of Extraterritorial Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, 9 Fordham J. Corp. &amp; Fin. L. 89, 106\xe2\x80\x93108, 115\xe2\x80\x93116 (2004); Langevoort, <em>Schoenbaum</em> Revisited: Limiting the Scope of Antifraud Protection in an Internationalized Securities Marketplace, 55 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 241, 244\xe2\x80\x93248 (1992).  Some have challenged the premise underlying the Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach, namely that Congress did not consider the extraterritorial application of \xc2\xa710(b) (thereby leaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine what Congress would have wanted).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Sachs, The International Reach of Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935: The Myth of Congressional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat\xe2\x80\x99l L. 677 (1990) (arguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the Exchange Act to transactions abroad).  Others, more fundamentally, have noted that using congressional silence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the traditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial application.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad): A Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to the Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law &amp; Pol\xe2\x80\x99y Int\xe2\x80\x99l Bus. 477, 492\xe2\x80\x93493 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The criticisms seem to us justified.  The results of judicial-speculation-made-law\xe2\x80\x94divining what Congress would have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the court\xe2\x80\x94demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Rather than guess anew in each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, the regulation under which petitioners have brought suit,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] was promulgated under \xc2\xa710(b), and \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend beyond conduct encompassed by \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Hagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/642/index.html">521 U.

Therefore, if \xc2\xa710(b) is not extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On its face, \xc2\xa710(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies abroad:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, \xe2\x80\xa6 any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and Exchange] Commission may prescribe \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 78j(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPetitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however, that three things indicate that \xc2\xa710(b) or the Exchange Act in general has at least some extraterritorial application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, they point to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d a term used in \xc2\xa710(b), which includes \xe2\x80\x9ctrade, commerce, transportation, or communication \xe2\x80\xa6 between any foreign country and any State.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778c(a)(17).  But \xe2\x80\x9cwe have repeatedly held that even statutes that contain broad language in their definitions of \xe2\x80\x98commerce\xe2\x80\x99 that expressly refer to \xe2\x80\x98<em>foreign</em> commerce\xe2\x80\x99 do not apply abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Aramco</em>, 499 U. S., at 251; see <em>id.,</em> at 251\xe2\x80\x93252 (discussing cases).  The general reference to foreign commerce in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate commerce\xe2\x80\x9d does not defeat the presumption against extraterritoriality.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that Congress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act, observed that the \xe2\x80\x9cprices established and offered in such transactions are generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign countries.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778b(2).  The antecedent of \xe2\x80\x9csuch transactions,\xe2\x80\x9d however, is found in the first sentence of the section, which declares that \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are affected with a national public interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778b.  Nothing suggests that this <em>national</em> public interest pertains to transactions conducted upon <em>foreign</em> exchanges and markets.  The fleeting reference to the dissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securities traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, there is \xc2\xa730(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778dd(b), which <em>does</em> mention the Act\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial application: \xe2\x80\x9cThe provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent \xe2\x80\xa6 evasion of [the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  (The parties have pointed us to no regulation promulgated pursuant to \xc2\xa730(b).)  The Solicitor General argues that \xe2\x80\x9c[this] exemption would have no function if the Act did not apply in the first instance to securities transactions that occur abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not convinced.  In the first place, it would be odd for Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of the whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing a condition precedent to its application abroad.  And if the whole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s enabling regulations be limited to those preventing \xe2\x80\x9cevasion\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act, rather than all those preventing \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d?  The provision seems to us directed at actions abroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might cause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to escape on a technicality.  At most, the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s proposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations of statutory language do not override the presumption against extraterritoriality.  See <em>Aramco</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 253.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General also fails to account for \xc2\xa730(a), which reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer \xe2\x80\xa6 to make use of the mails or of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effecting on an exchange not within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, any transaction in any security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is organized under the laws of, or has its principal place of business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778dd(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSubsection 30(a) contains what \xc2\xa710(b) lacks: a clear statement of extraterritorial effect.  Its explicit provision for a specific extraterritorial application would be quite superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to transactions on foreign exchanges\xe2\x80\x94and its limitation of that application to securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative.  Even if that were not true, when a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms.  See <em>Microsoft Corp. </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/437/index.html">550 U. S. 437</a>, 455\xe2\x80\x93456 (2007).  No one claims that \xc2\xa730(a) applies here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence claims we have impermissibly narrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies abroad, citing for that point the dissent in <em>Aramco</em>, see <em>post</em>, at 6.  But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to think, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a \xe2\x80\x9cclear statement rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.,</em> if by that is meant a requirement that a statute say \xe2\x80\x9cthis law applies abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d  Assuredly context can be consulted as well.  But whatever sources of statutory meaning one consults to give \xe2\x80\x9cthe most faithful reading\xe2\x80\x9d of the text, <em>post</em>, at 7, there is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here.  The concurrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but merely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indications relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.  As the opinion <em>for</em> <em>the Court</em> in <em>Aramco</em> (which we prefer to the dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not suffice.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that \xc2\xa710(b) applies extraterritorially, and we therefore conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners argue that the conclusion that \xc2\xa710(b) does not apply extraterritorially does not resolve this case.  They contend that they seek no more than domestic application anyway, since Florida is where HomeSide and its senior executives engaged in the deceptive conduct of manipulating HomeSide\xe2\x80\x99s financial models; their complaint also alleged that Race and Hughes made misleading public statements there.  This is less an answer to the presumption against extraterritorial application than it is an assertion\xe2\x80\x94a quite valid assertion\xe2\x80\x94that that presumption here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its application requires further analysis.  For it is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks <em>all</em> contact with the territory of the United States.  But the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever <em>some</em> domestic activity is involved in the case.  The concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid sentinel, see <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, but our cases are to the contrary.  In <em>Aramco</em>, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired in Houston, and was an American citizen.  See 499 U. S., at 247.  The Court concluded, however, that neither that territorial event nor that relationship was the \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d of congressional concern, <em>id.</em>, at 255, but rather domestic employment.  See also <em>Foley Bros.</em>, 336 U. S., at 283, 285\xe2\x80\x93286.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where the deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of securities in the United States.  Section 10(b) does not punish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b).  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Zandford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/813/index.html">535 U. S. 813</a>, 820 (2002).  Those purchase-and-sale transactions are the objects of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude.  It is those transactions that the statute seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Superintendent of Ins. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/6/index.html">404 U. S. 6</a>, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective parties to those transactions that the statute seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cprotec[t],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 10.  See also <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/185/index.html">425 U. S. 185</a>, 195 (1976).  And it is in our view only transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities, to which \xc2\xa710(b) applies.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by the very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as its object \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o provide for the regulation of securities exchanges \xe2\x80\xa6 operating in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and unfair practices on such exchanges \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 Stat. 881.  We know of no one who thought that the Act was intended to \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d <em>foreign</em> securities exchanges\xe2\x80\x94or indeed who even believed that under established principles of international law Congress had the power to do so.

The former extends the normal scope of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of rules prescribed by the Commission, a \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d in a United States security \xe2\x80\x9con an exchange not within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778dd(a).  And the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cany person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent evasion [of the Act].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778dd(b).  Under both provisions it is the foreign location of the <em>transaction</em> that establishes (or reflects the presumption of) the Act\xe2\x80\x99s inapplicability, absent regulations by the Commission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the same Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of the same comprehensive regulation of securities trading.  See <em>Central Bank of Denver, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/164/index.html">511 U.

S., at 256.  Like the United States, foreign countries regulate their domestic securities exchanges and securities transactions occurring within their territorial jurisdiction.  And the regulation of other countries often differs from ours as to what constitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what damages are recoverable, what discovery is available in litigation, what individual actions may be joined in a single suit, what attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are recoverable, and many other matters.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9321.  The Commonwealth of Australia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of France have filed <em>amicus</em> briefs in this case.  So have (separately or jointly) such international and foreign organizations as the International Chamber of Commerce, the Swiss Bankers Association, the Federation of German Industries, the French Business Confederation, the Institute of International Bankers, the European Banking Federation, the Australian Bankers\xe2\x80\x99 Association, and the Association Fran\xc3\xa7aise des Entreprises Priv\xc3\xa9es.  They all complain of the interference with foreign securities regulation that application of \xc2\xa710(b) abroad would produce, and urge the adoption of a clear test that will avoid that consequence.  The transactional test we have adopted\xe2\x80\x94whether the purchase or sale is made in the United States, or involves a security listed on a domestic exchange\xe2\x80\x94meets that requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which petitioners also endorse: \xe2\x80\x9c[A] transnational securities fraud violates [\xc2\xa7]10(b) when the fraud involves significant conduct in the United States that is material to the fraud\xe2\x80\x99s success.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16; see Brief for Petitioners 26.  Neither the Solicitor General nor petitioners provide any textual support for this test.  The Solicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a test would serve: achieving a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securities markets and thereby promoting investor confidence, and preventing the United States from becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cBarbary Coast\xe2\x80\x9d for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign markets.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But it provides no textual support for the last of these purposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign securities industry and securities markets abroad.  It is our function to give the statute the effect its language suggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to admirable purposes it might be used to achieve.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable consequences of the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and material conduct\xe2\x80\x9d test, one should also be repulsed by its adverse consequences.  While there is no reason to believe that the United States has become the Barbary Coast for those perpetrating frauds on foreign securities markets, some fear that it has become the Shangri-La of class-action litigation for lawyers representing those allegedly cheated in foreign securities markets.

S. 349</a> (2005).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  In that case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343 (2009 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defendants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in Maryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and deprive the Canadian Government of revenue.  544 U. S., at 353, 371.  Section 1343 prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fraud <em>simpliciter</em>, without any requirement that it be \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d any particular transaction or event.  The <em>Pasquantino </em>Court said that the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9coffense was complete the moment they executed the scheme inside the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his domestic element of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct [that] the Government is punishing.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 371.  Section 10(b), by contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only such acts \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not deception alone, but deception with respect to certain purchases or sales is necessary for a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General points out that the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and material conduct\xe2\x80\x9d test is in accord with prevailing notions of international comity.  If so, that proves that <em>if </em>the United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursuant to the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and material conduct\xe2\x80\x9d test it would not violate customary international law; but it in no way tends to prove that that is what Congress has done.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commission has adopted an interpretation similar to the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and material conduct\xe2\x80\x9d test, and that we should defer to that.  In the two adjudications the Solicitor General cites, however, the Commission did not purport to be providing its own interpretation of the statute, but relied on decisions of federal courts\xe2\x80\x94mainly Court of Appeals decisions that in turn relied on the <em>Schoenbaum</em> and <em>Leasco </em>decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed earlier.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re United Securities Clearing Corp.</em>, 52 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0C. 92, 95, n.\xc2\xa014, 96, n. 16 (1994); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Robert F.

Since the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations relied on cases we disapprove, which ignored or discarded the presumption against extraterritoriality, we owe them no deference.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 10(b) reaches the use of a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance only in connection with the purchase or sale of a security listed on an American stock exchange, and the purchase or sale of any other security in the United States.  This case involves no securities listed on a domestic exchange, and all aspects of the purchases complained of by those petitioners who still have live claims occurred outside the United States.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b).  In this case, the purchased securities are listed only on a few foreign exchanges, none of which has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a \xe2\x80\x9cnational securities exchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa778f.  The first category therefore does not apply.  Further, the relevant purchases of these unregistered securities took place entirely in Australia and involved only Australian investors.  And in accordance with the presumption against extraterritoriality, I do not read the second category to include such transactions.  Thus, while state law or other federal fraud statutes, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341 (mail fraud), \xc2\xa71343 (wire fraud), may apply to the fraudulent activity alleged here to have occurred in the United States, I believe that \xc2\xa710(b) does not.  This case does not require us to consider other circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To the extent the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is consistent with these views, I join it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963343">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nMORRISON V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778j(b), and SEC Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7240.10b\xe2\x80\x935(b) (2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges \xe2\x80\xa6 and domestic transactions in other securities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18.  If one confines one\xe2\x80\x99s gaze to the statutory text, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is a plausible one.  But the federal courts have been construing \xc2\xa710(b) in a different manner for a long time, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual analysis is not nearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the abandonment of their doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The text and history of \xc2\xa710(b) are famously opaque on the question of when, exactly, transnational securities frauds fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  As those types of frauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th century, the federal courts were increasingly called upon to wrestle with that question.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, located in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s financial center, led the effort.  Beginning in earnest with <em>Schoenbaum</em> v. <em>Firstbrook</em>, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d 200, rev\xe2\x80\x99d on rehearing on other grounds, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove, over an extended series of cases, to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern\xe2\x80\x9d under what circumstances \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would have wished the precious resources of the United States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 F.\xc2\xa03d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the Second Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects test.  This test asks \xe2\x80\x9c(1) whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or upon United States citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 171.  Numerous cases flesh out the proper application of each prong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test became the \xe2\x80\x9cnorth star\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa710(b) jurisprudence, <em>ante</em>, at 8, not just regionally but nationally as well.  With minor variations, other courts converged on the same basic approach.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>15 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe courts have uniformly agreed that Section 10(b) can apply to a transnational securities fraud either when fraudulent conduct has effects in the United States or when sufficient conduct relevant to the fraud occurs in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7416 (1986) (setting forth conduct-and-effects test).  Neither Congress nor the Securities Exchange Commission (Commission) acted to change the law.  To the contrary, the Commission largely adopted the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s position in its own adjudications.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this history, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s critique of the decision below for applying \xe2\x80\x9cjudge-made rules\xe2\x80\x9d is quite misplaced.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  This entire area of law is replete with judge-made rules, which give concrete meaning to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 general commands.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we deal with private actions under Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935,\xe2\x80\x9d then-Justice Rehnquist wrote many years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cwe deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blue Chip Stamps</em> v. <em>Manor Drug Stores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/index.html">421 U.

The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Mother Court\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of securities law tended to that oak.  <em>Id.,</em> at 762 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (describing the Second Circuit).  One of our greatest jurists\xe2\x80\x94the judge who, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a doubt, did more to shape the law of securities regulation than any [other] in the country\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]\xe2\x80\x94was its master arborist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The development of \xc2\xa710(b) law was hardly an instance of judicial usurpation.  Congress invited an expansive role for judicial elaboration when it crafted such an open-ended statute in 1934.  And both Congress and the Commission subsequently affirmed that role when they left intact the relevant statutory and regulatory language, respectively, throughout all the years that followed.  See Brief for Alecta pensionsf\xc3\xb6rs\xc3\xa4kring, \xc3\xb6msesidigt et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 31\xe2\x80\x9333; cf. <em>Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett</em> v. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/286/index.html">508 U.

Unlike certain other domains of securities law, this is \xe2\x80\x9ca case in which Congress has enacted a regulatory statute and then has accepted, over a long period of time, broad judicial authority to define substantive standards of conduct and liability,\xe2\x80\x9d and much else besides.  <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC</em> v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/148/index.html">552 U. S. 148</a>, 163 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has not shied away from acknowledging that authority.  We have consistently confirmed that, in applying \xc2\xa710(b) and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935, courts may need \xe2\x80\x9cto flesh out the portions of the law with respect to which neither the congressional enactment nor the administrative regulations offer conclusive guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blue Chip</em>, 421 U.

And we have unanimously \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[ed] a judicial authority to shape \xe2\x80\xa6 the 10b\xe2\x80\x935 cause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d for that is a task \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has left to us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Musick, Peeler</em>, 508 U. S., at 293, 294; see also <em>id.,</em> at 292 (noting with approval that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts have accepted and exercised the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the 10b\xe2\x80\x935 right and the definition of the duties it imposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, we have unanimously endorsed the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s basic interpretive approach to \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x94ridiculed by the Court today\xe2\x80\x94of striving to \xe2\x80\x9cdivin[e] what Congress would have wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 12.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cOur task,\xe2\x80\x9d we have said, is \xe2\x80\x9cto attempt to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Musick, Peeler</em>, 508 U.

The Second Circuit refined its test over several decades and dozens of cases, with the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission and with the general assent of its sister Circuits.  That history is a reason we should give additional weight to the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjudge-made\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, not a reason to denigrate it.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe longstanding acceptance by the courts, coupled with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to reject [its] reasonable interpretation of the wording of \xc2\xa710(b), \xe2\x80\xa6 argues significantly in favor of acceptance of the [Second Circuit] rule by this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Blue Chip</em>, 421 U. S., at 733.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s other main critique of the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach\xe2\x80\x94apart from what the Court views as its excessive reliance on functional considerations and reconstructed congressional intent\xe2\x80\x94is that the Second Circuit has \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the presumption against extraterritoriality.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  It is the Court, however, that misapplies the presumption, in two main respects.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption from a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a clear statement rule.  We have been here before.  In the case on which the Court primarily relies, <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a> (1991) <em>(Aramco)</em>, Chief Justice Rehnquist\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion included a sentence that appeared to make the same move.  See <em>id.,</em> at 258 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of the need to make a clear statement that a statute applies overseas is amply demonstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has expressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously objected.  See <em>id.,</em> at 261 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontrary to what one would conclude from the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, this canon is <em>not </em>a \xe2\x80\x98clear statement\xe2\x80\x99 rule, the application of which relieves a court of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the legislative will\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet even <em>Aramco</em>\xe2\x80\x94surely the most extreme application of the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time on the Court[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]\xe2\x80\x94contained numerous passages suggesting that the presumption may be overcome without a clear directive.  See <em>id.,</em> at 248\xe2\x80\x93255 (majority opinion) (repeatedly identifying congressional \xe2\x80\x9cintent\xe2\x80\x9d as the touchstone of the presumption).  And our cases both before and after <em>Aramco </em>make perfectly clear that the Court continues to give effect to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all available evidence</em> about the meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of a provision when considering its extraterritorial application, lest we defy Congress\xe2\x80\x99 will.  <em>Sale</em> v. <em>Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/155/index.html">509 U. S. 155</a>, 177 (1993) (emphasis added).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Contrary to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s personal view of statutory interpretation, that evidence legitimately encompasses more than the enacted text.  Hence, while the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dictum that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, makes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated.  The presumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a theory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing international conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker.  It does not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the most faithful reading possible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in suggesting that the presumption against extraterritoriality is fatal to the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test.  For even if the presumption really were a clear statement (or \xe2\x80\x9cclear indication,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal relevance to this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true, of course, that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court ordinarily construes ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>F.\xc2\xa0Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</em> v. <em>Empagran S.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/155/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/155/index.html">542 U. S. 155</a>, 164 (2004), and that, absent contrary evidence, we presume \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is primarily concerned with domestic conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html"></a><a href="/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285 (1949).  Accordingly, the presumption against extraterritoriality \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a sound basis for concluding that Section 10(b) does not apply when a securities fraud with no effects in the United States is hatched and executed entirely outside this country.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22.  But that is just about all it provides a sound basis for concluding.  And the conclusion is not very illuminating, because no party to the litigation disputes it.  No one contends that \xc2\xa710(b) applies to wholly foreign frauds.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather, the real question in this case is how much, and what kinds of, <em>domestic </em>contacts are sufficient to trigger application of \xc2\xa710(b).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In developing its conduct-and-effects test, the Second Circuit endeavored to derive a solution from the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, history, and purpose.  Judge Friendly and his colleagues were well aware that United States courts \xe2\x80\x9ccannot and should not expend [their] resources resolving cases that do not affect Americans or involve fraud emanating from America.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 175; see also <em>id.,</em> at 171 (overriding concern is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98whether there is sufficient United States involvement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Itoba Ltd.</em> v. <em>Lep Group PLC</em>, 54 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 122 (CA2 1995))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question just stated does not admit of an easy answer.  The text of the Exchange Act indicates that \xc2\xa710(b) extends to at least some activities with an international component, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Second Circuit draws the line as follows: \xc2\xa710(b) extends to transnational frauds \xe2\x80\x9conly when substantial acts in furtherance of the fraud were committed within the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Berger</em>, 322 F.\xc2\xa03d 187, 193 (CA2 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the fraud was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intended to produce\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and did produce \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98detrimental effects within\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the United States, <em>Schoenbaum</em>, 405 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 206.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach is consistent with the understanding shared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the Exchange Act, \xe2\x80\x9cexpected U. S. securities laws to apply to certain international transactions or conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buxbaum, Multinational Class Actions Under Federal Securities Law: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum.

(detailing evidence that Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmeant \xc2\xa710(b) to protect against fraud in the sale or purchase of securities whether or not these were traded on organized United States markets\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is also consistent with the traditional understanding, regnant in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s as it is now, that the presumption against extraterritoriality does not apply \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the conduct [at issue] occurs within the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and has lesser force when \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure to extend the scope of the statute to a foreign setting will result in adverse effects within the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc.</em> v. <em>Massey</em>, 986 F.\xc2\xa02d 528, 531 (CADC 1993); accord, Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa738 (1964\xe2\x80\x931965); cf. <em>Small</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/385/index.html">544 U.

And it strikes a reasonable balance between the goals of \xe2\x80\x9cpreventing the export of fraud from America,\xe2\x80\x9d protecting shareholders, enhancing investor confidence, and deterring corporate misconduct, on the one hand, and conserving United States resources and limiting conflict with foreign law, on the other.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 175.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, while \xc2\xa710(b) may not give any \xe2\x80\x9cclear indication\xe2\x80\x9d on its face as to how it should apply to transnational securities frauds, <em>ante</em>, at 6, 16, it does give strong clues that it should cover at least some of them, see n.\xc2\xa09, <em>supra</em>.  And in my view, the Second Circuit has done the best job of discerning what sorts of transnational frauds Congress meant in 1934\xe2\x80\x94and still means today\xe2\x80\x94to regulate.

I take issue with the Court for beginning <em>and ending</em> its inquiry with the statutory text, when the text does not speak with geographic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of, and the persuasive account of congressional intent embodied in, the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Repudiating the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach in its entirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose private parties from bringing \xc2\xa710(b) actions whenever the relevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are not listed on a domestic exchange.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The real motor of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against extraterritoriality but rather the Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief that transactions on domestic exchanges are \xe2\x80\x9cthe focus of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe objects of [its] solicitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, 18.  In reality, however, it is the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic interest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of investors\xe2\x80\x9d that are the objects of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude.  <em>Europe &amp; Overseas Commodity Traders, S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Banque Paribas London</em>, 147 F.\xc2\xa03d 118, 125 (CA2 1998) (citing H.\xc2\xa0R.

And while the clarity and simplicity of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s test may have some salutary consequences, like all bright-line rules it also has drawbacks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Imagine, for example, an American<em> </em>investor who buys shares in a company listed only on an overseas exchange.  That company has a major American subsidiary with executives based in New York City; and it was in New York City that the executives masterminded and implemented a massive deception which artificially inflated the stock price\xe2\x80\x94and which will, upon its disclosure, cause the price to plummet.  Or, imagine that those same executives go knocking on doors in Manhattan and convince an unsophisticated retiree, on the basis of material misrepresentations, to invest her life savings in the company\xe2\x80\x99s doomed securities.  Both of these investors would, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new test, be barred from seeking relief under \xc2\xa710(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The oddity of that result should give pause.  For in walling off such individuals from \xc2\xa710(b), the Court narrows the provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach to a degree that would surprise and alarm generations of American investors\xe2\x80\x94and, I am convinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule turns \xc2\xa710(b) jurisprudence (and the presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head, by withdrawing the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application from cases in which there is <em>both</em> substantial wrongful conduct that occurred in the United States <em>and </em>a substantial injurious effect on United States markets and citizens.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my judgment, if petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegations of fraudulent misconduct that took place in Florida are true, then respondents may have violated \xc2\xa710(b), and could potentially be held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought by the Commission.  But it does not follow that shareholders who have failed to allege that the bulk or the heart of the fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud had an adverse impact on American investors or markets, may maintain a private action to recover damages they suffered abroad.  Some cases involving foreign securities transactions have extensive links to, and ramifications for, this country; this case has Australia written all over it.  Accordingly, for essentially the reasons stated in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion, I would affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court instead elects to upend a significant area of securities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive, construction of the statutory text.  In so doing, it pays short shrift to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in remedying frauds that transpire on American soil or harm American citizens, as well as to the accumulated wisdom and experience of the lower courts.
