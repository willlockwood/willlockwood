It has never been the policy of Congress to prevent the administration of its own statutes from being judicially confined to the scope of authority granted or to the objectives specified.

The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives agreed that Congress ordinarily intends that there be judicial review, and emphasized the clarity with which a contrary intent must be expressed:</p>\n<p>"The statutes of Congress are not merely advisory when they relate to administrative agencies, any more than in other cases.  To preclude judicial review under this bill, a statute, if not specific in withholding such review, must upon its face give clear and convincing evidence of an intent to withhold it.

First, the Government contends that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b) (1982 ed., Supp. II), which authorizes "Appeal by individuals," impliedly forecloses administrative or judicial review of any action taken under Part B of the Medicare program by failing to authorize such review while simultaneously authorizing administrative and judicial review of "any determination . . . as to . . . the amount of benefits under part A," \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b)(1)(C).  Second, the Government asserts that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii (1982 ed., Supp. II), which makes applicable 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 405(h) (1982 ed., Supp. II), of the Social Security Act to the Medicare program, expressly precludes all administrative or judicial review not otherwise provided in that statute.

Under Part B of that program, which is at issue here, the Secretary contracts with private health insurance carriers to provide benefits for which individuals voluntarily remit premiums.  This optional coverage, which is federally subsidized, supplements the mandatory institutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="675">Page 476 U.

Bennett)).\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents\' federal court challenge to the validity of the Secretary\'s regulation is not foreclosed by \xc2\xa7 1395ff as we construed that provision in <em>Erika.</em>  The reticulated statutory scheme, which carefully details the forum and limits of review of "any determination . . . of . . . the amount of benefits under part A," 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b)(1)(C) (1982 ed., Supp. II), and of the "amount of . . . payment" of benefits under Part B, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3)(C), simply does not speak to challenges mounted against the <em>method</em> by which such amounts are to be determined, rather than the <em>determinations</em> themselves.  As the Secretary has made clear, "the legality, constitutional or otherwise, of any provision of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="676">Page 476 U. S. 676</a></p><p> the Act or regulations relevant to the Medicare Program" is not considered in a "fair hearing" held by a carrier to resolve a grievance related to a determination of the amount of a Part B award. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  As a result, an attack on the validity of a regulation is not the kind of administrative action that we described in <em>Erika</em> as an "amount determination" which decides "the amount of the Medicare payment to be made on a particular claim" and with respect to which the Act impliedly denies judicial review.  456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/201/case.html#208">456 U. S. 208</a></span>.</p>\n<p>That Congress did not preclude review of the method by which Part B awards are computed (as opposed to the computation) is borne out by the very legislative history we found persuasive in <em>Erika.</em>  The Senate Committee Report on the original 1965 legislation reveals an intention to preclude "judicial review of a determination concerning the <em>amount of benefits</em> under part B where claims will probably </p><p><a class="page-number" name="677">Page 476 U. S. 677</a></p><p> be for substantially smaller amounts than under part A."  S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 54-55 (1965) (emphasis added).  The Report makes plain that "carriers, not the Secretary, would review beneficiary complaints regarding the <em>amount of benefits.</em>"  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  <em>Accord,</em> H.R.Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 47 (1965) ("Under the supplementary plan [Part B], carriers, not the Secretary, would review beneficiary complaints regarding the <em>amount of benefits</em>" (emphasis added)).  The legislative history of the pertinent 1972 amendment likewise reveals that judicial review was precluded only as to controversies regarding determinations of amounts of benefits.  The Conference Report on the 1972 amendment explains that</p>\n<p>"there is no authorization for an appeal to the Secretary or for judicial review on matters <em>solely involving amounts of benefits under Part B.</em>"</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1605, p. 61 (1972) (emphasis added).  Senator Bennett\'s introductory explanation to the amendment confirms that preclusion of judicial review of Part B awards -- designed "to avoid overloading the courts with quite minor matters" -- embraced only "decisions on a claim for payment for a given service."  118 Cong.Rec. 33992 (1972).  The Senator feared that,</p>\n<p>"[i]f judicial review is made available where any claim is denied, as some court decisions have held, the resources of the Federal court system would be unduly taxed and little real value would be derived by the enrollees.  The proposed amendment would merely clarify the original intent of the law and prevent the overloading of the courts with trivial matters because the intent is considered unclear."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  As we found in <em>Erika,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/201/case.html#206">456 U. S. 206</a></span>, Congress has precluded judicial review only "of adverse hearing officer determinations of the amount of Part B payments." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="678">Page 476 U. S. 678</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Careful analysis of the governing statutory provisions and their legislative history thus reveals that Congress intended to bar judicial review only of determinations of the amount of benefits to be awarded under Part B.  Congress delegated this task to carriers who would finally determine such matters in conformity with the regulations and instructions of the Secretary.  We conclude, therefore, that those matters which Congress did <em>not</em> leave to be determined in a "fair hearing" conducted by the carrier -- including challenges to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations -- are not impliedly insulated from judicial review by 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395ff (1982 ed. and Supp. II).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In light of Congress\' express provision for carrier review of millions of what it characterized as "trivial" claims, it is implausible to think it intended that there be <em>no</em> forum to adjudicate statutory and constitutional challenges to regulations promulgated by the Secretary.  The Government nevertheless maintains that this is precisely what Congress intended to accomplish in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395ii (1982 ed., Supp. II).  That section states that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 405(h) (1982 ed., Supp. II), along with a string citation of 10 other provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act, "shall also apply with respect to this subchapter to the same extent as they are applicable with respect to subchapter II of this chapter."  Section 405(h), in turn, reads in full as follows:</p>\n<p>"(h) Finality of Secretary\'s decision "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="679">Page 476 U. S. 679</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The findings and decision of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.  No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided.  No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter."</p>\n<p>The Government contends that the third sentence of \xc2\xa7 406(h) by its terms prevents any resort to the grant of general federal question jurisdiction contained in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It finds support for this construction in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/749/case.html">422 U.

Section 405(h) does not apply on its own terms to Part B of the Medicare program, but is instead incorporated <em>mutatis mutandis</em> by \xc2\xa7 1395ii.  The legislative history of both the statute establishing the Medicare program and the 1972 amendments thereto provides specific evidence of Congress\' intent to foreclose review only of "amount determinations" -- <em>i.e.,</em> those "quite minor matters," 118 Cong.Rec. 33992 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Bennett), remitted finally and exclusively to adjudication by private insurance carriers in a "fair hearing." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  By the same token, matters which Congress did <em>not</em> delegate to private carriers, such as challenges to the validity of the Secretary\'s instructions and regulations, are cognizable in courts of law.  In the face of this persuasive evidence of legislative intent, we will not indulge the Government\'s assumption that Congress contemplated review by carriers of "trivial" monetary claims, <em>ibid.,</em> but intended no review at all of substantial statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary\'s administration of Part B of the Medicare program.
