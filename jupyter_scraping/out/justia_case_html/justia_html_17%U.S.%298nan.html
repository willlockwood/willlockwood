S. 304</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court is satisfied with the proof which has been made of the <em>Constitution\'s</em> having had a commission at the time of making the capture, and that such commission was granted by the government of Venezuela, and also that the same was lost with the privateer herself a very short time after the prize crew took possession of the <em>Estrella.</em>  The fact of the sinking of the <em>Constitution</em> is not disputed, and that she had, at the time she went down, a commission on board is also fully made out, which commission there is no reason to believe was any other than the one which the collector of New Orleans says was on board when she arrived in that port from Carthagena.  This was some time in the month of October in the year 1816,  Mr. Chew then saw the commission, and describes it as a very regular one from the Venezuelan republic, signed, as others were, by Bolivar.  Although the Court in another case has said, that the seal of a government, unacknowledged, cannot be permitted to prove itself, it has in the same case said, that the fact of a vessel\'s being so employed may be established without proving the seal.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/16/610/case.html#635">United States v. Palmer,</a></span></em> 3 Wheat. 635.</p>\n<p>But if the <em>Constitution</em> had a commission on board, it is next alleged that the same was issued or delivered within the waters of the United States with intent that she should be employed in the service of Venezuela to commit hostilities at sea against the subjects of the King of Spain, with whom the United States was at peace.  This allegation is not supported by any evidence; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 17 U. S. 305</a></p><p> on the contrary, the same witnesses who declare that the <em>Constitution</em> was a commissioned vessel, and whose testimony has already been adverted to, establish beyond controversy that the same was obtained abroad, and not issued or delivered within the United States.</p>\n<p>The libel next alleges that the <em>Constitution,</em> previous to her last cruise, had been fitted out and armed, or that her force had been increased or augmented, within the jurisdiction and waters of the United States, and also, that she had there been manned by sundry citizens or residents of the United States with the same intent.  Whatever doubt there may be as to the augmentation of the armament of the <em>Constitution</em> within the United States, the Court is satisfied that a very considerable addition was made to her crew, at New Orleans after her arrival at that port; one of the custom house officers declares that at that time she had only from twenty to twenty-five men; another of these officers, who went on board on her first arrival, states the number of her crew at about twenty, and a witness by the name of Guzman, totally unconnected with this transaction, mentions by name two persons who entered on board while she was lying there.  Several of the original crew of the <em>Estrella</em> have also been examined to this point, who state that after the capture, they had many conversations with the officers and seamen who composed the prize crew, by whom they were informed that the <em>Constitution,</em> when she left Carthagena, had but few hands on board; that at New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 17 U. S. 306</a></p><p> Orleans she shipped almost the whole of her crew, which at the time of the <em>Estrella\'s</em> capture amounted to sixty or seventy men.  This species of testimony has been objected to as being hearsay and proceeding from a source entitled to no great credit.  Although there may be something in this objection, it is no reason for rejecting the evidence altogether.  If the testimony be hearsay, it must be recollected that the declarations proceeded from persons very much interested in giving a different representation of the transaction; and as to the witnesses themselves, although they formed a part of the <em>Estrella\'s</em> crew and may have felt some little interest in the question, they were the only persons who could give any account of the armament or crew of the <em>Constitution</em> at the time of her making the capture.  It may be also remarked that the testimony of these men is in this respect corroborated by that of other witnesses who are liable to no objection, and that their declarations, if untrue, might have been disproved by the claimant by showing where and when the crew of the <em>Constitution</em> had been entered.</p>\n<p>But if any of the crew of the <em>Constitution</em> were enlisted or entered within the jurisdiction of the United States, they may, it is said, have been citizens or subjects of the Republic of Venezuela who were transiently in the United States at the time of her arrival and had, therefore, a right, within one of the provisos of the second section of the Act of Congress of 6 June, 1794, c. 226, to enlist or enter themselves on board of her; and it is insisted that the libellant should have shown that they were not persons of this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 17 U. S. 307</a></p><p> description.  The Court is not of this opinion.  On the libellant, in the first instance, lay the onus of showing that the crew of the <em>Constitution</em> had been increased within the United States; having done this, it became incumbent on the captors, if they wanted to establish their innocence, to show, as was in their power, if the fact was so, that they had done nothing contrary to law by bringing their case within the proviso that has been mentioned.</p>\n<p>The allegation, then, in the libel being made out that the <em>Constitution,</em> being a privateer commissioned by the Republic of Venezuela, was manned within the United States previous to the cruise on which she captured the <em>Estrella</em> by sundry citizens or residents of the United States, it remains to see whether the libellant has not made out a case for restitution.  It has been attempted, but without success, to distinguish this case in principle from several which have already been decided in this Court.  We have been told, as heretofore, that to the courts of the nation to which the captor belongs and from which his commission issues exclusively appertains the right of adjudicating on all captures and questions of prize.  This is not denied, nor has the Court ever felt any disposition to entrench on this rule, but, on the contrary, whenever an occasion has occurred, as in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/14/238/case.html">The Invincible,</a></span></em> 1 Wheat. 238, it has been governed by it.  Not only is it a rule well established by the customary and conventional law of nations, but it is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 17 U. S. 308</a></p><p> founded in good sense, and is the only one which is salutary and safe in practice.  It secures to a belligerent the independence to which every sovereign state is entitled and which would be somewhat abridged were he to condescend so far as to permit those who bear his commission to appear before the tribunals of any other country and submit to their interpretation or control the orders and instructions under which they have acted.  It ensures also not only to the belligerent himself but to the world at large a great decree of caution and responsibility on the part of the agents whom he appoints, who not only give security to him for their good behavior, but will sometimes be checked in a lawless career by the consideration that their conduct is to be investigated by the courts of their own nation and under the very eye of the sovereign under whose sanction they are committing hostilities.  In this way also is a foundation laid for a claim by other nations of an indemnity against the belligerent for the injuries which their subjects may sustain by the operation of any unjust or improper rules which he may think proper to prescribe for those who act under his authority.</p>\n<p>But general and firmly established as this rule is, it is not more so than some of the exceptions which have grown out of it.  A neutral nation which knows its duty will not interfere between belligerents so as to obstruct them in the exercise of their undoubted right to judge, through the medium of their own courts, of the validity of every capture made under their respective commissions, and to decide on every question of prize law which may </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 17 U. S. 309</a></p><p> arise in the progress of such discussion.  But it is no departure from this obligation if, in a case in which a captured vessel be brought or voluntarily comes <em>infra praesidia,</em> the neutral nation extends its examination so far as to ascertain whether a trespass has been committed on its own neutrality by the vessel which has made the capture.  So long as a nation does not interfere in the war, but professes an exact impartiality towards both parties, it is its duty as well as right, and its safety, good faith and honor demand of it, to be vigilant in preventing its neutrality from being abused for the purposes of hostility against either of them.  This may be done not only by guarding, in the first instance, so far as it can, against all warlike preparations and equipments in its own waters, but also by restoring to the original owner such property as has been wrested from him, by vessels which have been thus illegally fitted out.  In the performance of this duty, all the belligerents must be supposed to have an equal interest, and a disregard or neglect of it would inevitably expose a neutral nation to the charge of insincerity and to the just dissatisfaction and complaints of the belligerent, the property of whose subjects should not under any such circumstances be restored.</p>\n<p>The United States, instead of opening its ports to all the contending parties when at peace themselves (as may be done if not prevented by antecedent treaties), has always thought it the wisest and safest course to interdict them all from fitting out or furnishing vessels of war within their limits, and to punish those who may contribute to such equipments. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 17 U. S. 310</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To enforce a general and strict observance of this neutrality on the part of our own citizens and of others who reside among us, a law passed as early as the year 1794 making it penal, among other things, for anyone within the jurisdiction of the United States to enlist in the service of any foreign prince or state as a soldier, marine, or seaman on board of any vessel of war, letter of marque or privateer.  This law, it is supposed, was not in force at the time when the crew of the <em>Constitution</em> was increased at New Orleans, having been repealed, as is alleged, by the Act of 3 March, 1817, c. 58.  But this act contains no repealing clause of this or any other section of the former law, and having made no provision on the subject of enlistment, it must have been the intention of the legislature to leave in full force all those parts of the first law which had undergone no alteration in the one which was then passing, and we therefore find no repeal of the act in question until 20 April, 1818, when all the provisions respecting our neutral relations were embraced by one act and all former laws on the same subject were repealed.</p>\n<p>But whether the Act of 1794, c. 226, was in force or not would make no difference, for it did not in terms contain, nor did any of the others which have from time to time been passed, contain a provision for the restitution of property captured on the ocean by vessels which might be thus illegally fitted out or manned in our ports.  It is true they recognize a right in the courts of the United States to make restitution when these laws have been disregarded, and impart </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 17 U. S. 311</a></p><p> to the courts a power to punish those who are concerned in such violations.  But in the absence of every act of Congress in relation to this matter, the Court would feel no difficulty in pronouncing the conduct here complained of an abuse of the neutrality of the United States, and although in such case the offender could not be punished, the former owner would nevertheless be entitled to restitution.  Nor is our opinion confined to the single act of an illegal enlistment of men, which is the only fact proved in this case, for we have no hesitation in saying that for any of the other violations of our neutrality alleged in the libel, if they had been proved, the Spanish owner would have been equally entitled to restitution.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
