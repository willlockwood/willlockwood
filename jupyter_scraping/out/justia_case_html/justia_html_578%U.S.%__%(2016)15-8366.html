In the decision below, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the State had put petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness at issue during his capital sentencing proceeding and acknowledged that Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s only alternative sentence to death was life imprisonment without parole.  238 Ariz. 84, 103, 357 P. 3d 119, 138 (2015).  But the court nonetheless concluded that Lynch had no right to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and burglary for the 2001 killing of James Panzarella.  The State sought the death penalty.  Before Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase trial began, Arizona moved to prevent his counsel from informing the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without the possibility of parole.  App. K to Pet. for Cert.  The court granted the motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s first penalty phase jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.  A second jury was convened and sentenced Lynch to death.  On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the sentence because the jury instructions improperly described Arizona law.  The court did not address Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that the trial court had violated <i>Simmons</i>.  On remand, a third penalty phase jury sentenced Lynch to death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, this time considering and rejecting Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Simmons</i> claim.  The court agreed that, during the third penalty phase, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State suggested .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that Lynch could be dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138.  The court also recognized that Lynch was parole ineligible: Under Arizona law, \xe2\x80\x9cparole is available only to individuals who committed a felony before January 1, 1994,\xe2\x80\x9d and Lynch committed his crimes in 2001.  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa741\xe2\x80\x931604.09(I)).  Nevertheless, while \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n instruction that parole is not currently available would be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe failure to give the <i>Simmons</i> instruction was not error.\xe2\x80\x9d  238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That conclusion conflicts with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  In <i>Simmons</i>, as here, a capital defendant was ineligible for parole under state law.  512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 156 (plurality opinion).  During the penalty phase, the State argued that the jurors should consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness when determining the proper punishment.  <i>Id.</i>, at 157.  But the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to tell the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without parole.  <i>Id.,</i> at 157, 160.  The Court reversed, reasoning that due process entitled the defendant to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he posed a future danger by informing his sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible.  <i>Id.</i>, at 161\xe2\x80\x93162; <i>id.</i>, at 178 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions reiterated that holding in <i>Ramdass</i>, <i>Shafer</i>, and <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>South Carolina</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246 (2002)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Arizona Supreme Court thought Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing law sufficiently different from the others this Court had considered that <i>Simmons</i> did not apply.  It relied on the fact that, under state law, Lynch could have received a life sentence that would have made him eligible for \xe2\x80\x9crelease\xe2\x80\x9d after 25 years.  238 Ariz., at 103\xe2\x80\x93104, 357 P. 3d, at 138\xe2\x80\x93139; \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93751(A).  But under state law, the only kind of release for which Lynch would have been eligible\xe2\x80\x94as the State does not contest\xe2\x80\x94is executive clemency.  See Pet. for Cert. 22; 238 Ariz., at 103\xe2\x80\x93104, 357 P. 3d, at 138\xe2\x80\x93139.  And <i>Simmons</i> expressly rejected the argument that the possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to inform a jury of his parole ineligibility.  There, South Carolina had argued that the defendant need not be allowed to present this information to the jury \xe2\x80\x9cbecause future exigencies,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9ccommutation [and] clemency,\xe2\x80\x9d could one day \xe2\x80\x9callow [him] to be released into society.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166 (plurality opinion).  The Court disagreed: \xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that the State opposes even a simple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothetical future developments, the argument has little force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>id.,</i> at 177 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.) (explaining that the defendant had a right \xe2\x80\x9cto bring his parole ineligibility to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xe2\x80\x9d and that the State could respond with \xe2\x80\x9ctruthful information regarding the availability of commutation, pardon, and the like\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State responds that <i>Simmons</i> \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98applies only to instances where, as a legal matter, there is <i>no possibility</i> of parole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 11 (quoting <i>Ramdass</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 169 (plurality opinion)).  Notwithstanding the fact that Arizona law currently prevents all felons who committed their offenses after 1993 from obtaining parole, 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138, Arizona reasons that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing prevents the legislature from creating a parole system in the future for which [Lynch] would have been eligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possibility of release after 25 years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief in Opposition 12.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents also foreclose that argument.  <i>Simmons</i> said that the potential for future \xe2\x80\x9clegislative reform\xe2\x80\x9d could not justify refusing a parole-ineligibility instruction.  512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166 (plurality opinion).  If it were otherwise, a State could always argue that its legislature might pass a law rendering the defendant parole eligible.  Accordingly, as this Court later explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dispositive fact in <i>Simmons</i> was that the defendant conclusively established his parole ineligibility under state law at the time of his trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ramdass</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 171 (plurality opinion).  In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court confirmed that parole was unavailable to Lynch under its law.  <i>Simmons</i> and its progeny establish Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s right to inform his jury of that fact.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> are granted.  The judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3578669">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">SHAWN PATRICK LYNCH <i>v.</i> ARIZONA</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">No. 15\xe2\x80\x938366.\xe2\x80\x83Decided May 31, 2016</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch and his co-conspirator, Michael Sehwani, met their victim, James Panzarella, at a Scottsdale bar on March 24, 2001.  The three went back to Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s house early the next morning.  Around 5 a.m., Sehwani called an escort service.  The escort and her bodyguard arrived soon after.  Sehwani paid her $300 with two checks from Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s checkbook after spending an hour with her in the bedroom.  Lynch and Sehwani then left the house with Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s credit and debit cards and embarked on a spending spree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><b>The afternoon of March 25, someone found Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s body bound to a metal chair in his kitchen.  His throat was slit.  Blood surrounded him on the tile floor.  The house was in disarray.  Police discovered a hunting knife in the bedroom.  A knife was also missing from the kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s knifeblock.  And there were some receipts from Lynch and Sehwani\xe2\x80\x99s spending spree.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Police found Lynch and Sehwani at a motel two days after the killing.  They had spent the days with Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s credit and debit cards buying cigarettes, matches, gas, clothing, and Everlast shoes, renting movies at one of the motels where they spent an afternoon, and making cash withdrawals.  When police found the pair, Sehwani wore the Everlast shoes, and Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s shoes were stained with Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s blood.  A sweater, also stained with his blood, was in the back seat of their truck, as were Panzarella\xe2\x80\x99s car keys.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A jury convicted Lynch of first-degree murder, kidnaping, armed robbery, and burglary, and ultimately sentenced him to death.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  But today, the Court decides that sentence is no good because the state trial court prohibited the parties from telling the jury that Arizona had abolished parole.  <i>Ante,</i> at 1; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa741\xe2\x80\x931604.09(I) (1999).  The Court holds that this limitation on Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing proceeding violated <i>Simmons </i>v. <i>South Carolina</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154 (1994)\n.  Under <i>Simmons</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the State puts the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury\xe2\x80\x94by either argument or instruction\xe2\x80\x94that he is parole ineligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 178 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s summary reversal perpetuates the Court\xe2\x80\x99s error in <i>Simmons</i>.  See <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>South Carolina</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246,\n262 (2002)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting); <i>Shafer</i> v. <i>South Carolina</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36,\n58 (2001)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting).  As in <i>Simmons</i>, it is the \xe2\x80\x9csheer depravity of [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] crimes, rather than any specific fear for the future, which induced the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. jury to conclude that the death penalty was justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 181 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In <i>Simmons</i>, for example, the defendant beat and raped three elderly women\xe2\x80\x94one of them his own grandmother\xe2\x80\x94before brutally killing a fourth.  See <i>ibid.</i>  The notion that a jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose a death sentence \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been altered by information on the <i>current state of the law </i>concerning parole (which could of course be amended) is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. farfetched,\xe2\x80\x9d to say the least.  <i>Id.,</i> at 184.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worse, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision imposes a magic-words requirement.  Unlike <i>Simmons</i>, in which there was \xe2\x80\x9cno instruction at all\xe2\x80\x9d about the meaning of life imprisonment except that the term should be construed according to its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[plain] and ordinary meaning,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 160, 166 (plurality opinion), here there was an instruction about the nature of the alternative life sentences that the trial court could impose:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIf your verdict is that the Defendant should be sentenced to death, he will be sentenced to death.  If your verdict is that the Defendant should be sentenced to life, he will not be sentenced to death, and the court will sentence him to either life without the possibility of release until at least 25 calendar years in prison are served, or \xe2\x80\x98natural life,\xe2\x80\x99 which means the Defendant would never be released from prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. S to Pet. for Cert. 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That instruction parallels the Arizona statute governing Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing proceedings.  That statute prescribed that defendants not sentenced to death could receive either a life sentence with the possibility of early release or a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural life\xe2\x80\x9d sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the court does not sentence the defendant to natural life, the defendant shall not be released on any basis until the completion of the service of twenty-five calendar years,\xe2\x80\x9d but a defendant sentenced to \xe2\x80\x9cnatural life\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9cnot be released on any basis for the remainder of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s natural life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93703(A) (2001).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even though the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s instruction was a correct recitation of Arizona law, the Court holds that <i>Simmons </i>requires more.  The Court laments that (at least for now) Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s only form of early release in Arizona is executive clemency.  <i>Ante, </i>at 3.  So the Court demands that the Arizona instruction specify that \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of release\xe2\x80\x9d does not (at least for now) include parole.  Due process, the Court holds, requires the court to tell the jury that if a defendant sentenced to life with the possibility of early release <i>in 25 years</i> were to seek early release <i>today</i>, he would be ineligible for parole under Arizona law.  <i>Ante,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Nonsense.  The Due Process Clause does not compel such \xe2\x80\x9cmicromanage[ment of] state sentencing proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Shafer</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 58 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94issued without full briefing and argument and based on <i>Simmons, </i>a fractured decision of this Court that did not produce a majority opinion\xe2\x80\x94is a remarkably aggressive use of our power to review the States\xe2\x80\x99 highest courts.  The trial court accurately told the jury that Lynch could receive a life sentence with or without the possibility of early release, and that should suffice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Sehwani ultimately pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and theft and received a sentence of natural life without the possibility of early release plus one year.
