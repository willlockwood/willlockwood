Under this act, one Vose, professing to have claims against the vessel, had a warrant issued and the vessel seized.  For the purpose of discharging the vessel from the custody of the sheriff, and in pursuance of the statute, one Cockroft gave his bond to Vose, whereby he became bound to pay to Vose the amount of all such claims and demands "as shall have been exhibited, which shall be established to have been subsisting liens" upon the vessel pursuant to the statute above mentioned.

It was there argued by counsel that, the obligors having given the bond and got the benefits of the statute by having their vessel released, were estopped to deny the validity of the statute under which they took that benefit.  In the decision of the Court of Appeals the opinion is expressed that the statute was invalid as being against the provision of the United States. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 81 U.

S. 8</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It does not appear to us that the Court of Appeals, in which the case was decided, held the state statute to be valid, and if it did not, the jurisdiction of this Court cannot be invoked to declare it invalid.</p>\n<p>The suit before us was an action on a bond given by the owners of the vessel and their sureties to release her when she had been attached in the original proceeding to enforce the lien, and several questions were raised in the defense, none of which seems, from the pleading, or anything else in the record, to have been founded on the invalidity of the statute.  One of these questions evidently was whether the credit was given to the owner personally or to the vessel, and another was whether, after the bond had been given and the vessel released, the obligors in the bond were not estopped to deny the validity of the proceeding in the attachment suit.</p>\n<p>Now if the court decided the case on this latter ground, as it may have done, or on any of the other grounds except the validity of the statute, we have no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The inference from the condition of the record that the court did not decide the statute valid might receive confirmation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 81 U. S. 9</a></p><p> from the opinion of that court if we were at liberty to consider it, for it is there held that the statute is invalid for the very reason given here by the plaintiff in error why we should hold it invalid.</p>\n<p>On the whole we do not find, from anything in the record of this case that the question relied on here was decided against the right claimed by plaintiff in error, and the writ is therefore</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
