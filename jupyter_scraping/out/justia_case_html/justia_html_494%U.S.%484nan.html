S. 486</a></p><p> 1983, is entitled to federal habeas relief.  His claim is that an instruction in the penalty phase of his trial, telling the jury to avoid any influence of sympathy, violates the Eighth Amendment.  In <em>Penry v. Lynaugh,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html">492 U. S. 302</a></span> (1989), we held that a new rule of constitutional law will not be applied in cases on collateral review unless the rule comes within one of two narrow exceptions.  This limitation on the proper exercise of habeas corpus jurisdiction applies to capital and noncapital cases.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#314">492 U. S. 314</a></span>.  We hold that Parks is not entitled to federal habeas relief.  The principle he urges is a new rule within the meaning of <em>Teague v. Lane,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html">489 U. S. 288</a></span> (1989).  It is not dictated by our prior cases and, were it to be adopted, it would contravene well-considered precedents.  We also hold that the rule petitioner asks us to adopt does not come within either of the two exceptions set forth in <em>Teague.</em></p>\n<p>A passing motorist found Abdullah Ibrahim, a native of Bangladesh, dead inside the Oklahoma City gas station where Ibrahim worked.  The victim died from a single chest wound inflicted by a .45-caliber pistol.  Parks admitted the murder to a friend, and the police obtained tapes of that statement.  Parks said that he shot Ibrahim because he was afraid Ibrahim would tell the police that Parks used a stolen credit card to purchase gasoline.</p>\n<p>In 1978, a jury found Parks guilty of capital murder.  During the sentencing phase of the trial, Parks offered as mitigating evidence the testimony of his father, who described Parks\' background and character.  Parks\' counsel relied upon this testimony in his closing argument, arguing that Parks\' youth, race, school experiences, and broken home were mitigating factors that the jury should consider in making its sentencing decision.  He asked the jury to show "kindness" to Parks in consideration of his background.</p>\n<p>After instructing the jury that it must consider all of the mitigating circumstances, statutory or nonstatutory, proffered by Parks, and that it could consider any mitigating circumstances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 494 U. S. 487</a></p><p> that it found from the evidence, the trial court delivered the following instruction:</p>\n<p>"You are the judges of the facts.  The importance and worth of the evidence is for you to determine.  You must avoid any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence.  You should discharge your duties as jurors impartially, conscientiously and faithfully under your oaths and return such verdict as the evidence warrants when measured by these Instructions."</p>\n<p>App. 13.  After finding as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was "committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution," Okla.Stat., Tit. 21, \xc2\xa7 701.12 (1981), the jury sentenced Parks to death.</p>\n<p>Parks\' conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, <em>Parks v. State,</em> 651 P.2d 686 (1982), and we denied certiorari, 459 U.S. 1155 (1983).  After seeking postconviction relief in the state courts, Parks filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court arguing, <em>inter alia,</em> that the antisympathy instruction delivered in the penalty phase violated the Eighth Amendment because it in effect told the jury to disregard the mitigating evidence that Parks had presented.  The District Court denied relief, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  <em>Parks v. Brown,</em> 840 F.2d 1496 (1988).  On rehearing, the Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed, holding that the antisympathy instruction was unconstitutional for the reasons advanced by Parks.  <em>Parks v. Brown,</em> 860 F.2d 1545 (1988).  We granted certiorari, 490 U.S. 1034 (1989), and now reverse.</p>\n<p>Parks petitions the federal courts for a writ of habeas corpus.  As he is before us on collateral review, we must first determine whether the relief sought would create a new rule under our holdings in <em>Teague v. Lane, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#299">489 U.

If so, we will neither announce nor apply the new rule sought by Parks unless it would fall </p><p><a class="page-number" name="488">Page 494 U. S. 488</a></p><p> into one of two narrow exceptions.  <em>Teague, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#307">489 U. S. 307</a></span>; <em>Penry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#329">492 U. S. 329</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Teague,</em> we defined a new rule as a rule that "breaks new ground," "imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government," or was not "<em>dictated</em> by precedent existing at the time the defendant\'s conviction became final."  <em>Teague, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#301">489 U.

The explicit overruling of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule; it is more difficult, however, to determine whether we announce a new rule when a decision extends the reasoning of our prior cases.  As we recognized in <em>Butler v. McKellar, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#412">494 U. S. 412</a></span>-414, the question must be answered by reference to the underlying purposes of the habeas writ.  Foremost among these is ensuring that state courts conduct criminal proceedings in accordance with the Constitution as interpreted at the time of the proceedings.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#413">494 U.

Under this functional view of what constitutes a new rule, our task is to determine whether a state court considering Parks\' claim at the time his conviction became final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule Parks seeks was required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Parks contends that the result he seeks does not involve the creation of a new rule.  Relying upon our decisions in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 494 U. S. 489</a></p><p> <em>Lockett v. Ohio,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html">438 U. S. 586</a></span> (1978), and <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/case.html">455 U. S. 104</a></span> (1982), both decided before his conviction became final in 1983, and our decision in <em>California v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html">479 U. S. 538</a></span> (1987), decided after his conviction became final, Parks argues that the Eighth Amendment, as interpreted in 1983, required, and still requires, that jurors be allowed to base the sentencing decision upon the sympathy they feel for the defendant after hearing his mitigating evidence.  We disagree, and conclude that adoption of this principle would create a new rule as defined in <em>Teague</em> and <em>Penry.</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Lockett,</em> a plurality of the Court decided that an Ohio death penalty statute that limited the jury\'s consideration to specified mitigating circumstances violated the constitutional requirement of individualized sentencing in capital cases.  <em>See</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U. S. 605</a></span>.  The plurality based its conclusion on the view that</p>\n<p>"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor,</em> any aspect of a defendant\'s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#604">438 U. S. 604</a></span> (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>In <em>Eddings,</em> the view adopted by the <em>Lockett</em> plurality ripened into a holding of the Court.  We ruled that a sentencing judge\'s refusal, as a matter of law, to consider mitigating evidence presented by a capital defendant concerning his family history and upbringing was constitutional error.  Relying on the plurality opinion in <em>Lockett,</em> the Court reasoned:</p>\n<p>"Just as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, <em>as a matter of law,</em> any relevant mitigating evidence.  In this instance, it was as if the trial judge had instructed a jury to disregard the mitigating evidence <em>Eddings</em> proffered on his behalf.  The sentencer . . . may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence.  But they may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 494 U. S. 490</a></p><p> their consideration."</p>\n<p><em>Eddings,</em> 455 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/1/case.html#13">455 U. S. 13</a></span>-115 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Review of our decisions in <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> convinces us that the two cases do not dictate the result urged by Parks.  There is no dispute as to the precise holding in each of the two cases:  that the State cannot bar relevant mitigating evidence from being presented and considered during the penalty phase of a capital trial.  These two cases place clear limits on the ability of the State to define the factual bases upon which the capital sentencing decision must be made.  Indeed, that is how we have interpreted these decisions in later cases.  <em>See Hitchcock v. Dugger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/393/case.html">481 U. S. 393</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/393/case.html#398">481 U. S. 398</a></span>-399 (1987) (instruction to advisory jury not to consider nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, and refusal by sentencing judge to consider the same); <em>Skipper v. South Carolina,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/case.html">476 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/case.html#4">476 U. S. 4</a></span>-5 (1986) (exclusion of evidence regarding defendant\'s post-offense conduct).</p>\n<p><em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> do not speak directly, if at all, to the issue presented here:  whether the State may instruct the sentencer to render its decision on the evidence without sympathy.  Parks asks us to create a rule relating, not to <em>what</em> mitigating evidence the jury must be permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision, but to <em>how</em> it must consider the mitigating evidence.   There is a simple and logical difference between rules that govern what factors the jury must be permitted to consider in making its sentencing decision and rules that govern how the State may guide the jury in considering and weighing those factors in reaching a decision.  We thus cannot say that the large majority of federal and state courts that have rejected challenges to antisympathy instructions similar to that given at Parks\' trial have been unreasonable in concluding that the instructions do not violate the rule of <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings.</em> <em>See Byrne v. Butler,</em> 847 F.2d 1135, 1138-1140 (CA5 1988); <em>People v. Emerson,</em> 122 Ill.2d 411, 442-443, 522 N.E.2d 1109, 1122 (1987), <em>cert. denied,</em> 488 U.S. 900 (1988); <em>State v.

Porterfield,</em> 746 S.W.2d 441, 450-451 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied,</em> 486 U.S. 1017 (1988).  Even were we to agree with Parks\' assertion that our decisions in <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> inform, or even control or govern, the analysis of his claim, it does not follow that they compel the rule that Parks seeks.  <em>See Butler, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#414">494 U. S. 414</a></span>-415.</p>\n<p>Parks contends that our decision in <em>Penry</em> that the relief sought there did not call for the creation of a new rule compels a similar result in this case.  We disagree.  In <em>Penry,</em> we held that resolution of a claim that the Texas death penalty scheme prevented the jury from considering and giving effect to certain types of mitigating evidence did not involve the creation of a new rule under <em>Teague.</em> <em>See Penry,</em> 492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#315">492 U. S. 315</a></span>.  To the extent that <em>Penry\'s</em> claim was that the Texas system prevented the jury from giving any mitigating effect to the evidence of his mental retardation and abuse in childhood, the decision that the claim did not require the creation of a new rule is not surprising.  <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> command that the State must allow the jury to give effect to mitigating evidence in making the sentencing decision; <em>Penry\'s</em> contention was that Texas barred the jury from so acting.  Here, by contrast, there is no contention that the State altogether prevented Parks\' jury from considering, weighing, and giving effect to all of the mitigating evidence that Parks put before them; rather, Parks\' contention is that the State has unconstitutionally limited the manner in which his mitigating evidence may be considered.  As we have concluded above, the former contention would come under the rule of <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em>; the latter does not.</p>\n<p><em>Penry\'s</em> claim, moreover, did not ask us to apply the reasoning of <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> so much as it required us to apply our decision in <em>Jurek v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/case.html">428 U. S. 262</a></span> (1976).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 494 U. S. 492</a></p><p> <em>Penry</em> interpreted <em>Jurek</em> as holding that the Texas death penalty statute is constitutional so long as it is interpreted by the Texas courts to permit the jury to consider mitigating circumstances proffered by the defendant.  <em>See Penry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#316">492 U. S. 316</a></span>.  Having thus construed <em>Jurek,</em> we concluded that resolution of <em>Penry\'s</em> claim that "those assurances were not fulfilled <em>in his particular case,</em>" 492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#318">492 U. S. 318</a></span> (emphasis in original), did not involve the creation of a new rule:</p>\n<p>"In our view, the relief <em>Penry</em> seeks does not \'impos[e] a new obligation\' on the State of Texas.  Rather, <em>Penry</em> simply asks the State to fulfill the assurance upon which <em>Jurek</em> was based:  namely, that the special issues would be interpreted broadly enough to permit the sentencer to consider all of the relevant mitigating evidence a defendant might present in imposing sentence."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#315">492 U. S. 315</a></span> (citations omitted).  The <em>Penry</em> Court\'s conclusion that <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> dictated the rule sought by <em>Penry,</em> <em>see</em> 492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#318">492 U. S. 318</a></span>-319, must be understood in terms of the Court\'s ruling in <em>Jurek,</em> and its application in later cases.  We did not view <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> as creating a rule different from that relied upon in <em>Jurek;</em> rather, we indicated that <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> reaffirmed the reasoning in <em>Jurek, see</em> 492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#317">492 U. S. 317</a></span>-319, and confirmed the necessity of its application to <em>Penry\'s</em> claim.</p>\n<p>We also reject Parks\' contention that the antisympathy instruction runs afoul of <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> because jurors who react sympathetically to mitigating evidence may interpret the instruction as barring them from considering that evidence altogether.  This argument misapprehends the distinction between allowing the jury to consider mitigating evidence and guiding their consideration.  It is no doubt constitutionally permissible, if not constitutionally required, <em>see Gregg v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U.

Whether a juror feels sympathy for a capital defendant is more likely to depend on that juror\'s own emotions than on the actual evidence regarding the crime and the defendant.  It would be very difficult to reconcile a rule allowing the fate of a defendant to turn on the vagaries of particular jurors\' emotional sensitivities with our longstanding recognition that, above all, capital sentencing must be reliable, accurate, and nonarbitrary.  <em>See Gregg, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#189">428 U.

At the very least, nothing in <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> prevents the State from attempting to ensure reliability and nonarbitrariness by requiring that the jury consider and give effect to the defendant\'s mitigating evidence in the form of a "reasoned moral response," <em>Brown,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#545">479 U. S. 545</a></span> (emphasis in original), rather than an emotional one. The State must not cut off full and fair consideration of mitigating evidence; but it need not grant the jury the choice to make the sentencing decision according to its own whims or caprice. <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#541">479 U. S. 541</a></span>-543.</p>\n<p>Given the above discussion, it is obvious that our decision in <em>California v. Brown</em> is of no assistance to Parks.  In <em>Brown,</em> we held that an instruction telling the jury not to be "swayed by <em>mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling\'" during the sentencing phase did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#542">479 U. S. 542</a></span>.  We reasoned that a reasonable juror would interpret the instruction to ignore mere sympathy "as an admonition to ignore emotional responses that are not rooted in the aggravating and mitigating evidence," and that it was not unconstitutional for a State to "prohibi[t] juries from basing </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="494">Page 494 U. S. 494</a></em></p><p><em> their sentencing decisions on factors not presented at the trial."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#542">479 U. S. 542</a></span>-543.  Although we approved of the use of the antisympathy instruction given in <em>Brown,</em> Parks attempts to transform our reasoning in that case into a rule that the instruction given in his case violates the Eighth Amendment.\n</em></p>\n<p>Parks\' argument relies upon a negative inference:  because we concluded in <em>Brown</em> that it was permissible under the Constitution to prevent the jury from considering emotions not based upon the evidence, it follows that the Constitution requires that the jury be allowed to consider and give effect to emotions that are based upon mitigating evidence.  For the reasons discussed above, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/case.html#488">494 U. S. 488</a></span>-491, we doubt that this inference follows from <em>Brown</em> or is consistent with our precedents.  The same doubts are shared by the clear majority of federal and state courts that have passed upon the constitutionality of antisympathy instructions after <em>Brown.</em> <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/case.html#490">494 U. S. 490</a></span>-491.  The fact remains, however, that even if we accept Parks\' arguments, <em>Brown</em> itself was decided nearly four years after Parks\' conviction became final.  In order to gain the benefit, if any, of <em>Brown,</em> Parks must establish that the decision in <em>Brown</em> did not create a new rule.  To do so, Parks must contend that <em>Lockett</em> and <em>Eddings</em> dictated our reasoning, albeit perhaps not the result, in <em>Brown.</em>  Our discussion above makes it evident that they do not.</p>\n<p>Having decided that the relief Parks seeks would necessitate the creation of a new rule, we must determine whether the rule would come within either of the two exceptions to the general principle that new rules will not be applied on collateral review.  The first exception permits the retroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the State to proscribe, <em>see Teague,</em> 489 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#311">489 U. S. 311</a></span>, or addresses a "substantive categorical guarante[e] accorded by the Constitution," such as a rule "prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense."  <em>Penry,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 494 U. S. 495</a></p><p> 492 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#329">492 U. S. 329</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#330">492 U. S. 330</a></span>.  Parks cannot invoke this exception.  The rule sought by Parks would neither decriminalize a class of conduct nor prohibit the imposition of capital punishment on a particular class of persons.  <em>See Butler, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#415">494 U. S. 415</a></span>; <em>cf. Penry, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/case.html#329">492 U. S. 329</a></span>-330.</p>\n<p>The second exception is for "watershed rules of criminal procedure" implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.  <em>See Teague, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#311">489 U. S. 311</a></span>; <em>Butler, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#416">494 U. S. 416</a></span>. This exception is also inapplicable here.  Although the precise contours of this exception may be difficult to discern, we have usually cited <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span> (1963), holding that a defendant has the right to be represented by counsel in all criminal trials for serious offenses, to illustrate the type of rule coming within the exception.  <em>See, e.g., Teague, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#311">489 U. S. 311</a></span>-312; <em>Stumes,</em> 465 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html#653">465 U. S. 653</a></span>-654, and n. 4 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Whatever one may think of the importance of respondent\'s proposed rule, it has none of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in <em>Gideon</em> or other rules which may be thought to be within the exception.  The objectives of fairness and accuracy are more likely to be threatened than promoted by a rule allowing the sentence to turn not on whether the defendant, in the eyes of the community, is morally deserving of the death sentence, but on whether the defendant can strike an emotional chord in a Juror.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, and with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE STEVENS join except at to Part IV, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Respondent Robyn Parks was sentenced to death for the murder of a gas station attendant.  After his conviction became </p><p><a class="page-number" name="496">Page 494 U. S. 496</a></p><p> final in 1983, respondent brought a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254 (1982 ed.) challenging his conviction and death sentence.  He alleged, <em>inter alia,</em> that an instruction given at the sentencing phase of his trial that told the jury to avoid "any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence," App. 13, deprived him of an individualized sentencing determination because a reasonable juror could have understood the instruction to bar consideration of relevant mitigating evidence.  The Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, agreed and vacated respondent\'s death sentence.  <em>Parks v. Brown,</em> 860 F.2d 1545 (1988).  Today, the Court holds that respondent is not entitled to relief because his claim would require the application of a "new rule" that may not be applied retroactively on collateral review. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Court displays undue eagerness to apply the new standard for retroactivity announced in <em>Butler v. McKellar, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html">494 U. S. 407</a></span>, at the expense of thoughtful legal analysis.

Lane,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html">489 U. S. 288</a></span> (1989), the Court dramatically altered retroactivity doctrine as it applies to defendants challenging their confinement by the State through the collateral remedy of habeas corpus.  The Court held that a habeas petitioner may not obtain relief from an unconstitutional conviction or sentence if his claim would require the recognition of a "new rule" of criminal procedure.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#310">489 U.

McKellar, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#415">494 U. S. 415</a></span>, the Court defines a "new rule" as one that was "susceptible to debate among reasonable minds" under law prevailing at the time the habeas petitioner\'s conviction became final.  As I argued in my dissent in <em>Butler,</em> the Court\'s novel "reasonableness" review of state court convictions is incompatible with the fundamental purposes of habeas corpus.  <em>See Butler, ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html#424">494 U. S. 424</a></span>-430 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decisions in the instant case and in <em>Butler</em> leave no doubt that the Court has limited drastically the scope of habeas corpus relief through the application of a virtually all-encompassing definition of "new rule."  In this case, the Court concludes that respondent seeks a "new rule" because it determines that the few lower courts that have rejected similar challenges to an antisympathy instruction were not "unreasonable" for doing so.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/case.html#490">494 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The majority\'s conclusion, however, is based on a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 494 U.

The majority mischaracterizes respondent\'s claim as one demanding that "jurors be allowed to base the sentencing decision upon the sympathy they feel for the defendant after hearing his mitigating evidence," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/case.html#489">494 U. S. 489</a></span>, and holds that claim barred by <em>Teague.</em> <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/484/case.html#488">494 U. S. 488</a></span>-494.  But as counsel for respondent argued before this Court:</p>\n<p>"Mr. Parks asserts no constitutional right to a sympathetic or emotional jury.  What he does assert under <em>Woodson, Lockett, Eddings</em> and their progeny is the entirely familiar claim upheld consistently by this Court of a right to a sentencer who has not been precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of a defendant\'s background, character or record in addition to the circumstances of his offense that he proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg.19-20.  Respondent concedes the State\'s contention that a decision to impose the death penalty must reflect a "reasoned moral response" to the defendant\'s culpability.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Brief for Respondent 9.  What he argues is that his jury could have interpreted the antisympathy instruction as barring consideration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="499">Page 494 U. S. 499</a></p><p> of mitigating evidence.  More specifically, he claims that, because much of the mitigating evidence relevant to his culpability also evoked sympathy, a juror who reacted sympathetically to the evidence would have believed that he was not entitled to consider that evidence <em>at all</em> -- not even for its "moral" weight. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>See id.</em> at 10 ("[A]n antisympathy charge by the court, exploited by the prosecutor\'s remarks, erected a barrier to full consideration of mitigating proof about [respondent\'s] background.  Since these circumstances compromised respondent\'s chance to obtain a reasoned moral response from the jurors who held his life in the balance, his sentence is too unreliable to stand").  Respondent\'s actual claim, therefore, alleges nothing more than a violation of the rule recognized in <em>Lockett, supra,</em> and <em>Eddings, supra,</em> that a jury may not be prohibited from considering and giving effect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 494 U. S. 500</a></p><p> to all relevant mitigating evidence when deciding whether to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p>It was on this claim that the Tenth Circuit granted respondent habeas corpus relief.  860 F.2d at 1556.  The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p>"\'Mercy,\' \'humane\' treatment, \'compassion,\' and consideration of the unique \'humanity\' of the defendant, which have all been affirmed as relevant considerations in the penalty phase of a capital case, all inevitably involve sympathy or <em>are sufficiently intertwined with sympathy</em> that they cannot be parsed without significant risk of confusion in the mind of a reasonable juror. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Without placing an undue technical emphasis on definitions, it seems to us that sympathy is likely to be perceived by a reasonable juror as an essential or important ingredient of, if not a synonym for, \'mercy,\' \'humane\' treatment, \'compassion\' and a full \'individualized\' consideration of the \'humanity\' of the defendant and his \'character.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1556 (emphasis added).  In holding that the antisympathy instruction "undermined the jury\'s ability to consider fully [respondent\'s] mitigating evidence," the Tenth Circuit was careful to distinguish the claim at issue from the distorted version of respondent\'s claim that the Court revives today:</p>\n<p>"That argument misconstrues the issue.  The issue is not whether unbridled sympathy itself is a proper mitigating factor.  Rather, the issue is whether an <em>absolute</em> antisympathy instruction presents an impermissible danger of interfering with the jury\'s consideration of proper mitigating evidence.  We hold that it does.  The Supreme Court has made it clear that such a risk is \'unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1557 (quoting <em>Lockett,</em> 438 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/case.html#605">438 U.

This distinction is meaningless for a rule that limits the <em>manner</em> in which the jury considers mitigating evidence is unconstitutional if it limits the jury\'s ability to consider and give effect to that evidence.  But under the majority\'s approach, a law requiring the jury to discount the weight of all, or of certain, mitigating factors would be consistent with <em>Lockett</em> so long as the majority could describe the statute as relating to the "manner" in which the jury considers the evidence despite such a statute\'s obvious preclusive effect.  <em>Cf.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  A plurality of the Court in <em>Teague</em> concluded that only those new rules that amount to "bedrock procedural" rules "without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished" should be applied retroactively.  <em>Teague,</em> 489 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#313">489 U.

If the irrevocable nature of the death penalty is not sufficient to counsel against application of Justice Harlan\'s doctrine of limited retroactivity for collateral review </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 494 U. S. 506</a></p><p> altogether, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] it should at least inform the determination of the proper scope of the second <em>Teague</em> exception in capital cases. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Moreover, the majority\'s insistence that a rule must enhance the accuracy of the <em>factfinding process</em> in order to fit within the second exception is difficult to justify in the context of capital sentencing.  The decision whether to impose the death penalty represents a moral judgment about the defendant\'s culpability, not a factual finding.  <em>See Teague, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html#321">489 U.

Thus, the scope of the exception should be tailored to the unique nature of the sentencing decision. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 494 U. S. 507</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The foremost concern of the Eighth Amendment is that the death sentence not be imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  <em>See, e.g., Gregg v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html">428 U.

To comply with this command, a State must narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty, and must also ensure that the decision to impose the death penalty is individualized.  <em>See California v. Brown,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#541">479 U. S. 541</a></span>.  The right to an individualized sentencing determination is perhaps the most fundamental right recognized at the capital sentencing hearing.  <em>See Woodson v.

Rules ensuring the jury\'s ability to consider mitigating evidence guarantee that the jury acts with full information when formulating a moral judgment about the defendant\'s conduct.  Because such rules are integral to the proper functioning of the capital sentencing hearing, they must apply retroactively under the second <em>Teague</em> exception.  Thus, even if respondent\'s claim constitutes a "new rule," it must fall within the second exception.  I fear that the majority\'s failure to provide any principled analysis explaining why the second <em>Teague</em> exception does not apply in this case reflects the Court\'s growing displeasure with the litigation of capital cases on collateral review. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 494 U.

As JUSTICE O\'CONNOR has recognized,</p>\n<p>"one difficulty with attempts to remove emotion from capital sentencing through [antisympathy] instructions . . . is that juries may be misled into believing that mitigating evidence about a defendant\'s background or character also must be ignored."</p>\n<p><em>California v.

Until this Term, there had been little disagreement with this standard.  Today, however, a majority of the Court reformulates the appropriate inquiry as "whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction" in an unconstitutional manner.  <em>Boyde v.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In this case, the jury was instructed to "avoid <em>any</em> influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence."  App. 13 (emphasis added).  This instruction is distinguishable from the one upheld in <em>California v. Brown, supra.</em>  In that case, the Court rejected the argument that a reasonable juror could have interpreted an instruction not to be "swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling" as a command not to consider mitigating evidence.  The Court held instead that a reasonable juror would have understood</p>\n<p>"the instruction not to rely on \'<em>mere</em> sympathy\' as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the penalty phase."</p>\n<p>479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/case.html#542">479 U.

Because the jury in this case was told not to consider <em>any</em> sympathy -- rather than "mere sympathy" -- it is more likely that the jury at respondent\'s trial understood that, when making a moral judgment about respondent\'s culpability, it was forbidden from taking into account any evidence that evoked a sympathetic response.</p>\n<p>The context of the sentencing proceedings bolsters this conclusion.  The only mitigating evidence proffered by respondent was testimony about his deprived background from his father.  Although this evidence was relevant to the sentencing decision, because it bore on respondent\'s culpability, a juror\'s initial reaction to this evidence might have been to feel sympathy for respondent because of his hardship.  A juror who conscientiously followed the instruction to avoid <em>any</em> sympathy would have believed that he was required to ignore the father\'s testimony altogether, since only by excluding it completely from consideration could he eliminate all feelings of sympathy for respondent.  Moreover, because the father\'s testimony did not fit within the mitigating circumstances listed by the judge, it was all the more likely that a juror believed that the father\'s testimony was irrelevant to the sentencing decision.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  After explaining that none of the minimum mitigating circumstances were supported by the evidence, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<p>"[Defense counsel\'s] closing arguments are really a pitch to you for sympathy -- sympathy, or sentiment or prejudice; and you told me in <em>voir dire</em> you wouldn\'t do that."</p>\n<p>"Well it\'s just cold turkey.  He either did it or he didn\'t.  He either deserves the death penalty or he doesn\'t, you know.  You leave the sympathy, and the sentiment and prejudice part out of it."</p>\n<p>App. 75.  Given the sparse amount of evidence presented at the sentencing phase and the prosecutor\'s theme that the jury\'s deliberations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 494 U. S. 512</a></p><p> were to be purely mechanical, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed that the antisympathy instruction barred it from considering respondent\'s deprived background as a valid reason not to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the other instructions ensured that the antisympathy instruction would be correctly understood.  The trial judge did instruct the jury that it was required to consider a list of minimum mitigating circumstances, and that it was free to consider any other factor it deemed mitigating, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] but these instructions did not cure the infirmity of the anti-sympathy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 494 U.

Indeed, our earlier cases recognized that "sympathy" is an important ingredient in the Eighth Amendment\'s requirement of an individualized sentencing determination.  In <em>Woodson v.

The description of "mitigating evidence" as "compassionate or mitigating factors" necessarily includes the concept of sympathy, because "sympathy" is fairly regarded as a synonym for "compassion."  Webster\'s New International Dictionary 544 (2d ed.1957); Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 541 (1952).</p>\n<p>We can debate whether sympathy is an emotional reaction that has no place in a decision to impose the death penalty, or whether sympathy, although an emotion, plays an important role in forming the jury\'s <em>moral</em> response to the defendant\'s actions.  But this debate is an irrelevant academic exercise if, in a particular case, the jury is not <em>informed</em> of the distinction between the type of reaction to mitigating evidence that is an invalid emotional response and the type of reaction that is an acceptable "reasoned moral response."  This Court\'s incantation of that talismanic phrase cannot hide the fact that the jury instructions in this case did not clearly inform the jurors that their decision whether to impose the death penalty -- the most severe sanction available to society -- should represent a moral judgment about the defendant\'s culpability in light of all the available evidence.  I would think the Court would at least ensure that its views about the propriety of the death penalty were the ones actually transmitted to the jury.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The instructions at the sentencing phase of respondent\'s trial may well have misled the jury about its duty to consider the mitigating evidence respondent presented.  Until today, the Court consistently has vacated a death sentence and remanded for resentencing when there was any ambiguity about whether the sentencer actually considered mitigating evidence.  <em>See Eddings v.

The mere recitation of lower court cases does little to resolve the question, however, because ultimately it is this Court\'s responsibility to clarify the scope of its own holdings.
