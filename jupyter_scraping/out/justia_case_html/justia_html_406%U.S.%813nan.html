Anderson,</em> 6 Cal.3d 628, 493 P.2d 880 (1972).  That decision declared capital punishment in California unconstitutional under Art. 1, \xc2\xa7 6, of the state constitution.  The decision rested on an adequate state ground, and the State\'s petition for writ of certiorari was denied.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/91/case.html#98">406 U. S. 98</a></span>.  The California Supreme Court declared in the <em>Anderson</em> case that its decision was fully retroactive, and stated that any prisoner currently under sentence of death could petition a superior court to modify its judgment.  Petitioner thus no longer faces a realistic threat of execution, and the issue on which certiorari was granted -- the constitutionality of the death penalty under the Federal Constitution -- is now moot in his case.  Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
