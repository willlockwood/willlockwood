After the Alabama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, he sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court conditionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be released or resentenced.  The state trial court sentenced him to death a second time.  He filed another federal habeas application, challenging this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance during the resentencing proceeding.  The District Court once again conditionally granted the writ.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d challenge under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b) because he could have raised his fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">555 F.\xc2\xa03d 968, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV\xe2\x80\x93B, concluding that because Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s habeas application challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(b).  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9315, 17\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive habeas corpus application.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(1), (2).  The State contends that \xc2\xa72244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present.  Under this \xe2\x80\x9cone opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule, Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s fair-warning claim was \xe2\x80\x9csecond and successive\xe2\x80\x9d because he had an opportunity to raise it in his first application but did not.  Magwood counters that \xc2\xa72244(b) should not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment intervening between habeas applications.  This Court agrees.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d is not defined by AEDPA and it is a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of art.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Slack </em>v. <em>McDaniel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 486.  To determine its meaning, the Court looks first to the statutory context.  Section 2244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations apply only to a \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application under \xc2\xa72254,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> an application on \xe2\x80\x9cbehalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(b)(1).  Both \xc2\xa72254(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text and the relief it provides indicate that \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.  A \xc2\xa72254 petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cseeks invalidation \xe2\x80\xa6 of the judgment authorizing [his] confinement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Dotson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/74/index.html">544 U. S. 74</a>, 83.  If a conditional writ is granted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State may seek a <em>new</em> judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The State errs in contending that, if \xc2\xa72254 is relevant at all, \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d is the proper reference because unlawful \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d requirement for habeas relief.  This argument is unpersuasive.  Section 2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under \xc2\xa72254.  Because \xc2\xa72254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state-court judgment, that \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d is inextricable and essential to relief.  It is a requirement that distinguishes \xc2\xa72254 from other statutes permitting constitutional relief.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72255, 2241.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to any subsequent application filed before a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s strict rules to challenge the unrelated conviction <em>for the first time.  </em>Nothing in the statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court is also not convinced by the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a \xe2\x80\x9cone opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule would be consistent with the statute and should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.  AEDPA uses \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to modify \xe2\x80\x9capplication,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d as the State contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(b) that would \xe2\x80\x9celid[e] the difference between an \xe2\x80\x98application\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98claim,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a>, 9.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s reading also reflects a more fundamental error.  It would undermine or render superfluous much of \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  In some circumstances, it would increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where \xc2\xa72244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions.  In others, it would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where \xc2\xa72244(b) mandates stricter requirements.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(b) is consistent with its precedents.  Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State invokes, <em>e.g., Wong Doo</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/239/index.html">265 U. S. 239</a>, applies \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to an application challenging a new judgment, these cases shed no light on the question presented here.  Nor do post-AEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here.  Only <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/147/index.html">549 U. S. 147</a>, comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d if it challenges a new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive.  In holding that both of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in <em>Burton</em> expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment intervening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been different.  Here, there is such an intervening judgment.  This is Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s first application challenging that intervening judgment.  Magwood challenges not the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error in his first sentencing, but the court\xe2\x80\x99s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh.  Pp.\xc2\xa015, 17\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State\xe2\x80\x99s objection that this reading of \xc2\xa72244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original, undisturbed conviction.  Nor does the Court address whether Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.

After the Alabama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction and his sentence.  The District Court conditionally granted the writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood either be released or resentenced.  The state trial court conducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced Magwood to death.  Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new sentence.  The District Court once again conditionally granted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new sentence.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d challenge under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(b) because he could have mounted the same challenge to his original death sentence.  We granted certiorari, and now reverse.  Because Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s habeas application[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(b).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served several years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama, under the watch of Sheriff C. F. \xe2\x80\x9cNeil\xe2\x80\x9d Grantham.  During his incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of mental illness, became convinced that Grantham had imprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even upon his release.  Magwood followed through on his threat.  On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his release, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.  When Grantham exited his car, Magwood shot him and fled the scene.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of an on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x932(a)(5) (1975).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  He was tried in 1981.  The prosecution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggravated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought the death penalty.  Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital murder under \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x932(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of death based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.  In accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed the basis for the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x933, 13\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x934.  Although the court did not find the existence of any statutory \xe2\x80\x9caggravating circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x936, the court relied on <em>Ex parte Kyzer</em>, 399 So.\xc2\xa02d 330 (Ala. 1981), to find that murder of a sheriff while \xe2\x80\x9con duty or because of some official or job-related acts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x932(a)(5), is a capital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation sufficient for a death sentence.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The trial court found that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s young age (27 at the time of the offense) and lack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating factors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.  Weighing the aggravation against the two mitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of death.  The Alabama courts affirmed.  See <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>State</em>, 426 So.\xc2\xa02d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); <em>Ex parte Magwood, </em>426 So.\xc2\xa02d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983).  We denied certiorari.  <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/1124/index.html">462 U. S. 1124</a> (1983). After the Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date of July 22, 1983, Magwood filed a <em>coram nobis</em> petition and an application for a stay of execution.  The trial court held a hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18, 1983.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, and the District Court granted a stay of execution.  After briefing by the parties, the District Court upheld Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s conviction but vacated his sentence and conditionally granted the writ based on the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating to Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, 608 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 218, 225\xe2\x80\x93226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  See <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, 791 F.\xc2\xa02d 1438, 1450 (CA11 1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court held a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.  This time, the judge found that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s mental state, as well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as statutory mitigating circumstances.  As before, the court found that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s capital felony under \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x932(a)(5) included sufficient aggravation to render him death eligible.  In his proposed findings, Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s attorney agreed that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s offense rendered him death eligible, but argued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in light of the mitigating factors.  The trial court imposed a penalty of death, stating on the record that the new \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment and sentence [were] the result of a complete and new assessment of all of the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sentencing Tr., R. Tab 1, p. R\xe2\x80\x9325.  The Alabama courts affirmed, see <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>State, </em>548 So.\xc2\xa02d 512, 516 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988); <em>Ex parte Magwood</em>, 548 So.\xc2\xa02d 516, 516 (Ala. 1988), and this Court denied certiorari, see <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/923/index.html">493 U. S. 923</a> (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s former Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987) (now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming, <em>inter alia</em>, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence violated the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments because it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of the capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentencing.  The trial court denied relief.  It held that the statutory basis for Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated.  The trial court also held that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s attorney played no substantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation to dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court had required only that the trial court consider additional mitigating factors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition, arguing, <em>inter alia</em>, that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning that his offense could be punished by death, and that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing.  See Record in Appeal No. 92\xe2\x80\x93843 (Ala. Crim. App.), Tab 25, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 53\xe2\x80\x9361.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, citing its decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the death sentence.  See <em>Magwood</em> v. <em>State</em>, 689 So.\xc2\xa02d 959, 965 (1996) (citing <em>Kyzer, </em>399 So.\xc2\xa02d 330<em>, </em>and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State</em>, 501 So.\xc2\xa02d 542 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986)).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari, see 689 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 959, as did this Court, see <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/836/index.html">522 U. S. 836</a> (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 1997, Magwood sought leave to file a second or successive application for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his 1981 judgment of conviction.  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(3)(A) (requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a second or successive application).  The Court of Appeals denied his request.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Magwood, </em>113 F.\xc2\xa03d 1544 (CA11 1997).  He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence, which the District Court conditionally granted.  See <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Culliver, </em>481 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala. 2007).  In that petition, Magwood again argued that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance during the resentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before addressing the merits of Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s fair-warning claim, the District Court <em>sU. S.onte </em>considered whether the application was barred as a \xe2\x80\x9csuccessive petition\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244, and concluded that it was not.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1283\xe2\x80\x931284 (\xe2\x80\x9c[H]abeas petitions challenging the constitutionality of a resentencing proceeding are not successive to petitions that challenge the underlying conviction and original sentence\xe2\x80\x9d (citing 2 R.

See 481 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d,<em> </em>at 1285\xe2\x80\x931286; <em>supra, </em>at 5.  Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence was unconstitutional because \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have fair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at least one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former 1975 Ala.

The District Court also found the state court\xe2\x80\x99s grounds for rejecting Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim unreasonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s attorney in fact had engaged substantively in the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and new\xe2\x80\x9d resentencing, and although the attorney could not be expected to object on state-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly ineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning claim.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part.  See 555 F.\xc2\xa03d 968 (CA11 2009).  It concluded that the first step in determining whether \xc2\xa72244(b) applies is to \xe2\x80\x9cseparate the new claims challenging the resentencing from the old claims that were or should have been presented in the prior application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach, any claim that \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge[s] the new, amended component of the sentence\xe2\x80\x9d should be \xe2\x80\x9cregarded as part of a first petition,\xe2\x80\x9d and any claim that \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge[s] any component of the original sentence that was not amended\xe2\x80\x9d should be \xe2\x80\x9cregarded as part of a second petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Applying this test, the court held that because Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s fair-warning claim challenged the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the same (allegedly improper) aggravating factor that the trial court had relied upon for Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s original sentence, his claim was governed by \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d habeas applications.  <em>Id.</em>, at 975\xe2\x80\x93976.  The Court of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Magwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the exceptions to \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule requiring dismissal of claims first presented in a successive application.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  See <em>id</em>., at 976.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s application challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed as part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ from the District Court, is subject to the constraints that \xc2\xa72244(b) imposes on the review of \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d habeas applications.  558 U.

More specifically, it turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive habeas corpus application.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(1), (2).  If an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d the petitioner must obtain leave from the Court of Appeals before filing it with the district court.  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(3)(A).  The district court must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized second or successive application unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies certain statutory requirements.

Thus, if Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s application was \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court should have dismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the requisite authorization from the Court of Appeals.

To determine its meaning, we look first to the statutory context.  The limitations imposed by \xc2\xa72244(b) apply only to a \xe2\x80\x9chabeas corpus application under \xc2\xa72254,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, an \xe2\x80\x9capplication for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to<em> the judgment</em> of a State court,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(b)(1) (emphasis added).  The reference to a state-court judgment in \xc2\xa72254(b) is significant because the term \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be defined in a vacuum.  A \xc2\xa72254 petitioner is applying for something: His petition \xe2\x80\x9cseeks <em>invalidation</em> (in whole or in part) <em>of the</em> <em>judgment</em> authorizing the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s confinement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Dotson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/74/index.html">544 U. S. 74</a>, 83 (2005) (emphasis added).  If his petition results in a district court\xe2\x80\x99s granting of the writ, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State may seek a <em>new</em> judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).<em> </em>Thus, both \xc2\xa72254(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text and the relief it provides indicate that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State disagrees, contending that if the cross-reference to \xc2\xa72254 is relevant, we should focus not on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d but on its reference to \xe2\x80\x9ccustody,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 53; compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(a), (b) (establishing rules for review of \xe2\x80\x9can application for a writ of habeas corpus\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cbehalf of a person in custody pursuant to the <em>judgment </em>of a State court\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)) with \xc2\xa72254(a) (specifying that an application may be entertained \xe2\x80\x9conly on the ground that [the petitioner] is <em>in</em> <em>custody</em> in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The State explains that unlawful \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d is the key \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substance requirement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72254, whereas being held pursuant to a state-court \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d is merely a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98status requirement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 53 (quoting Liebman &amp; Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure<em> </em>\xc2\xa78.1, p.\xc2\xa0391).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find this argument unpersuasive.  Section 2254 articulates the kind of confinement that may be challenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held \xe2\x80\x9cin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(a).  The requirement of custody <em>pursuant to a</em> <em>state-court judgment </em>distinguishes \xc2\xa72254 from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from constitutional violations\xe2\x80\x94such as \xc2\xa72255, which allows challenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, which allows federal-court suits against state and local officials<em>.  </em>Custody is crucial for \xc2\xa72254 purposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that authorizes it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccustody\xe2\x80\x9d-based rule is difficult to justify for another reason.  Under the State\xe2\x80\x99s approach, applying the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to any subsequent application filed before a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s release would mean that a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for a completely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the strict rules for review under \xc2\xa72244(b) to challenge his unrelated conviction <em>for the first time.  </em>Nothing in the statutory text or context supports, much less requires, such an anomalous result.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Beyer, </em>306 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>, </em>at 507 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral attack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Dotson,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 85 (Scalia,\xc2\xa0J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one of several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate the challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains in custody to serve the others\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appearing to recognize that Magwood has the stronger textual argument, the State argues that we should rule based on the statutory purpose.  According to the State, a \xe2\x80\x9cone opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule is consistent with the statutory text, and better reflects AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded.  AEDPA uses the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to modify \xe2\x80\x9capplication.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(1), (2).  The State reads the phrase to modify \xe2\x80\x9cclaims.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Respondents 51 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 intent for AEDPA was to eradicate successive claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  We have previously found Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9capplication\xe2\x80\x9d significant, and have refused to adopt an interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(b) that would \xe2\x80\x9celid[e] the difference between an \xe2\x80\x98application\xe2\x80\x99 and a \xe2\x80\x98claim,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Artuz</em>, 531 U. S., at 9; see also <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/524/index.html">545 U. S. 524</a>, 530 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]or purposes of \xc2\xa72244(b), an \xe2\x80\x98application\xe2\x80\x99 for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more \xe2\x80\x98claims\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, although we agree with the State that many of the rules under \xc2\xa72244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d modify claims as well.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s reading leads to a second, more fundamental error.  Under the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cone opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d rule, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d would apply to any claim that the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise in a prior application.  And the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d would <em>not </em>apply to a claim that the petitioner did <em>not</em> have a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading of \xc2\xa72244(b) would considerably undermine\xe2\x80\x94if not render superfluous\xe2\x80\x94the exceptions to dismissal set forth in \xc2\xa72244(b)(2).  That section describes circumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be considered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly discovered facts suggesting \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\xa6 no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B)(ii).  In either circumstance, a petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity to raise the claim, so under the State\xe2\x80\x99s rule the claim would not be successive and \xc2\xa72244(b)(2) would not apply to it at all.  This would be true even if the claim were raised in a second application challenging the same judgment.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to duplicating the exceptions under \xc2\xa72244(b) in some circumstances, the State\xe2\x80\x99s rule would dilute them in others.  Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact-based claims not presented in a prior application applies only if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence \xe2\x80\x9cthat, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State\xe2\x80\x99s rule, all that matters is that the facts \xe2\x80\x9ccould not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B)(i).  We decline to adopt a reading that would thus truncate \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that the approach we take here contradicts our precedents.  The State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying review of claims in second or successive applications where the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior opportunities to present the claims.  See <em>Wong Doo</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/239/index.html">265 U. S. 239</a> (1924); <em>Antone</em> v. <em>Dugger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/200/index.html">465 U.

These cases, the State contends, show that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second or successive because he could have raised\xe2\x80\x94but did not raise\xe2\x80\x94the claim in his first application.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to an application challenging a new judgment.  Therefore, the decisions cast no light on the question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the-writ rules, as modified by AEDPA under \xc2\xa72244(b)(2), apply at all to an application challenging a new judgment.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its failure to distinguish between \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s threshold inquiry into whether an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d and its subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive application must be dismissed.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to our longstanding doctrine governing abuse of the writ.  AEDPA modifies those abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statutory rules under \xc2\xa72244(b).  These rules apply only to \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications.  The dissent contends that this reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range of abusive claims that would have been barred under prior rules.  Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this Court has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the petitioner raised it in an application challenging a new judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that our reading of \xc2\xa72254 \xe2\x80\x9cunmoor[s] the phrase \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 from its textual and historical underpinnings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post, </em>at 8, is unwarranted.  Pre-AEDPA usage of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d is consistent with our reading.  A review of our habeas precedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirmatively define the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in AEDPA.  Congress did not even apply the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d to applications filed by state prisoners until it enacted AEDPA.  The phrase originally arose in the federal context, see \xc2\xa72255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and applied only to applications raising previously <em>adjudicated</em> claims, see <em>Sanders</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/1/index.html">373 U.

It was not until 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d into \xc2\xa72244(b).  In light of this complex history of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d we must rely upon the current text to determine when the phrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or superseded statutory formulations.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do our <em>post</em>-AEDPA cases contradict our approach.  Only one, <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/147/index.html">549 U. S. 147</a> (2007) <em>(per curiam),</em> comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d if it challenges a new judgment.  And that case confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive.  In <em>Burton, </em>the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court in 1994.  See <em>id.</em>, at 149.  He successfully moved for resentencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 150.  The state appellate court affirmed the conviction but remanded for a second resentencing.  <em>Ibid.  </em>In March 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment and new sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 151.  In December 1998, with state review of his new sentence still pending, the petitioner filed a \xc2\xa72254 application challenging his 1994 conviction.  The District Court denied it on the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal, the petitioner filed a \xc2\xa72254 petition challenging only his 1998 sentence.

We rejected the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument \xe2\x80\x9cthat his 1998 and 2002 petitions challenged different judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 155; see <em>id</em>., at 156\xe2\x80\x93157.  Although petitioner had styled his first petition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his second petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we concluded that both attacked the same \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d because the 1998 sentence was already in place when the petitioner filed his first application for federal habeas relief.  See <em>id</em>., at 156.  In other words, the judgment he challenged in his 1998 application was \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>same one</em> challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition\xe2\x80\x9d; it \xe2\x80\x9cwas the judgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being detained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  We expressly recognized that the case might have been different had there been a \xe2\x80\x9cnew judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Ibid.  </em>There was no such judgment in <em>Burton</em>, but there is such an intervening judgment here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s <em>first </em>application challenging that intervening judgment.  The errors he alleges are <em>new</em>.  It is obvious to us\xe2\x80\x94and the State does not dispute\xe2\x80\x94that his claim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon new errors.  But, according to the State, his fair-warning claim does not, because the state court made the same mistake before.  We disagree.  An error made a second time is still a new error.  That is especially clear here, where the state court conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh.  See Sentencing Tr., R. Tab 1, at R\xe2\x80\x9325 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court in f[or]mulating the present judgment has <em>considered</em> the original record of the trial and sentence\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

A petitioner may not raise in federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in state court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the error.  If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural requirements for bringing an error to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xe2\x80\x94whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings, as state law may require\xe2\x80\x94procedural default will bar federal review.  See <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 729\xe2\x80\x93730 (1991); <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/838/index.html">526 U.

In this case, the State argued that Magwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by failing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the 1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground.  Only after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally default the claim did the District Court <em>sU. S.onte </em>consider whether \xc2\xa72244(b) barred review.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  We leave that procedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review in the first instance.  Here, we underscore only that procedural-default rules continue to constrain review of claims in all applications, whether the applications are \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d or not.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ironically, in an effort to effectuate what they believe is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent not to give any unfair benefit to habeas petitioners, the State and the dissent propose an alternative rule that would \xe2\x80\x9cclose our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Castro</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/375/index.html">540 U. S. 375</a>, 381 (2003).  Many examples can be given, but one suffices to illustrate this point.  Suppose that a petitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious claims challenging his conviction.  The district court grants a conditional writ based on one of them, without reaching the remaining nine.  Upon retrial, the state court commits the same 10 legal mistakes.  (These are new errors, but no more new than the sentencing error in Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s case.)  Is an application presenting those same 10 claims\xe2\x80\x94now based on the errors in the new judgment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d?  Under the opportunity-based rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the answer must be yes.  All 10 claims would have to be dismissed.  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim presented in a prior application).  The State attempts to avoid this \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural anomal[y],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Castro, supra, </em>at 380, by suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims as part of a first application, because they were never adjudicated on the merits.

We see no need to engage in such novel and complex rationalizations.  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s text commands a more straightforward rule: where, unlike in <em>Burton, </em>there is a \xe2\x80\x9cnew judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions,\xe2\x80\x9d 549 U.

The State believes this result follows because a sentence and conviction form a single \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of habeas review.  This case gives us no occasion to address that question, because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  We base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not altered by consequences the State speculates will follow in another case.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s first application challenging his new sentence under the 1986 judgment is not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(b).  The Court of Appeals erred by reading \xc2\xa72244(b) to bar review of the fair-warning claim Magwood presented in that application.  We do not address whether the fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted.

The Court, in my respectful submission, reaches this conclusion by misreading precedents on the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  The Court then rewrites AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s text but refuses to grapple with the logical consequences of its own editorial judgment.  A straightforward application of the principles articulated in <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/930/index.html">551 U. S. 930</a> (2007), consistent with the conclusions of all of the Courts of Appeals that have considered this issue, dictates the opposite result.  The design and purpose of AEDPA is to avoid abuses of the writ of habeas corpus, in recognition of the potential for the writ\xe2\x80\x99s intrusive effect on state criminal justice systems.  But today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, with considerable irony, is not only a step back from AEDPA protection for States but also a step back even from abuse-of-the-writ principles that were in place before AEDPA.  So this respectful dissent becomes necessary.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the relevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

S. 473</a>, 486 (2000).  It incorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.  <em>Panetti</em>, 551 U. S., at 947.  Before today, that legal principle was established by the decisions of this Court.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Slack</em>, 529 U. S., at 486.  Under that rule, to determine whether an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d a court must look to the substance of the claim the application raises and decide whether the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior application.  <em>Panetti</em>, 551 U. S., at 947.  Applying this analytical framework puts applications into one of three categories.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time application that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is consistent with pre-AEDPA cases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar on \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wong Doo</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/239/index.html">265 U. S. 239</a>, 241 (1924) (second application barred where petitioner had a \xe2\x80\x9cfull opportunity to offer proof\xe2\x80\x9d of the same claim in his first habeas application); <em>Woodard</em> v. <em>Hutchins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/377/index.html">464 U. S. 377</a>, 379 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring, writing for a majority of the Court) (second application barred for claims that \xe2\x80\x9ccould and should have been raised in [the] first petition\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Delo</em> v. <em>Stokes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/320/index.html">495 U.

As <em>McCleskey</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/467/index.html">499 U. S. 467</a>, 489 (1991), explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca petitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a subsequent petition that he could have raised in his first, regardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier stemmed from a deliberate choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify all the grounds for relief available to [them]\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cstate the facts supporting each ground\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Schlup</em> v. <em>Delo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/298/index.html">513 U.

This can occur where the claim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Panetti</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 947, or where the alleged violation occurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required by state law, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Alaska</em>, 297 F.\xc2\xa03d 895, 898\xe2\x80\x93899 (CA9 2002);<em> Crouch </em>v. <em>Norris</em>, 251 F.\xc2\xa03d 720, 723\xe2\x80\x93725 (CA8 2001); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Cain</em>, 137 F.\xc2\xa03d 234, 236 (CA5 1998).  And to respond to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, if the applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he raised in his first petition but the District Court left unaddressed at its own discretion, the second application would not be \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reraising a previously unaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition.  If the Court believes there are \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any examples\xe2\x80\x9d where abuse-of-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state prisoners seeking federal habeas review, <em>ibid.</em>, one would think the Court would be able to come up with an example.  It does not do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed petition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94raising both abusive and nonabusive claims\xe2\x80\x94would be \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  In that circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the nonabusive claims.  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore et\xc2\xa0al., Federal Practice \xc2\xa7671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010).  After the court of appeals makes its determination, a district court may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner had no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and dismiss the abusive claims.  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Panetti</em>.  Panetti\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he was mentally incompetent to be executed under <em>Ford</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/399/index.html">477 U. S. 399</a> (1986), did not become ripe until after the denial of his first habeas petition.  When the <em>Ford</em> claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas petition, raising his <em>Ford</em> claim for the first time.  In concluding that this second habeas petition was not a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application, this Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d did not \xe2\x80\x9crefe[r] to all \xc2\xa72254 applications filed second or successively in time,\xe2\x80\x9d but was rather a term-of-art that \xe2\x80\x9ctakes its full meaning from our case law, including decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U. S., at 943\xe2\x80\x93944.  The Court relied on AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98further[ing] the principles of comity, finality, and federalism,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 945 (quoting <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html">537 U. S. 322</a>, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the \xe2\x80\x9cempty formality requiring prisoners to file unripe\xe2\x80\x9d claims, 551 U. S., at 946, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-AEDPA cases regarding the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, <em>id.,</em> at 947.  <em>Panetti</em> thus looked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in-time habeas petition to determine that the application was not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The above principles apply to a situation, like the present one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceeding succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief, which allows the state court to correct an error that occurred at the original sentencing.  Assume, as alleged here, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing proceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake that also occurred at the first sentencing.  The second application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to that claim because the alleged error \xe2\x80\x9ccould and should have\xe2\x80\x9d been raised in the first petition.  <em>Woodard</em>, 464 U. S., at 379 (opinion of Powell, J.).  Put another way, under abuse-of-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to challenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportunity after his claim becomes ripe.  On the other hand, if the petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition that could not have been raised in the earlier petition\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because the error<em> </em>occurred for the first time during resentencing\xe2\x80\x94then the application raising the claim is not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s bar does not apply.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to show that the application in this case is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d it must be noted that no previous case from this Court has dealt with the precise sequence of events here: A petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim after a second resentencing proceeding that followed a grant of federal habeas relief.  The conclusion that such an application is barred as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d unless the claim was previously unavailable is consistent with the approach of every court of appeals that has considered the issue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties that are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>United States,</em> 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 54, 62\xe2\x80\x9363 (CA1 1997); <em>Galtieri </em>v.<em> United States,</em> 128 F. 3d 33, 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (CA2 1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.\xc2\xa03d 862, 871 (CA5 2000); <em>Lang </em>v. <em>United States, </em>474 F.\xc2\xa03d 348, 351\xe2\x80\x93353 (CA6 2007).  While most of these cases arose in the context of federal prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to their convictions or sentences under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255, the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d bar under \xc2\xa72244(b) applies to \xc2\xa72255 motions.  See \xc2\xa72255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the present case the Court should conclude that Magwood has filed a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive habeas corpus application.\xe2\x80\x9d  In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas petition raising nine claims, including that the trial court improperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when it imposed Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence.  The District Court granted Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s petition and ordered relief only on the mitigating factor claim.  The state trial court then held a new sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of the mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.  In 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this time raising an argument that could have been, but was not, raised in his first petition.  The argument was that he was not eligible for the death penalty because he did not have fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligible.  There is no reason that Magwood could not have raised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.  Because Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adjudicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in 1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill-defined exception to the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application bar.  The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical errors.  First, it errs in rejecting <em>Panetti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s claim-based approach to determining whether an application is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, it imposes an atextual exception to \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s bar against \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications, requiring that the second-in-time application be brought against the same judgment.  This second error is underscored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the logical implications of its newly created rule.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications rather than \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d claims, the nature of the claims raised in the second application is irrelevant.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]lthough we agree with the State that many of the rules under \xc2\xa72244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the phrase \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 modify claims as well\xe2\x80\x9d).  This is incorrect.  As explained above, <em>Panetti</em> establishes that deciding whether an application itself is \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d requires looking to the nature of the claim that the application raises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.  Indeed, the only way <em>Panetti</em> could have concluded that the application there was not \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d was to look at the underlying claim the application raised.  551 U. S., at 947.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Court asserts it is not calling <em>Panetti</em> into doubt, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa011, it does not even attempt to explain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf. <em>Panetti</em>, 551 U. S., at 964 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cBefore AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the phrase \xe2\x80\x98second or successive\xe2\x80\x99 meant the same thing it does today\xe2\x80\x94any subsequent federal habeas application challenging a state-court judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  The best that can be said is the Court is limiting its new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously unexhausted <em>Ford</em> claims, confining the holding of <em>Panetti</em> to the facts of that case.  551 U. S., at 968 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s decision thus stands only for the proposition that <em>Ford</em> claims somehow deserve a special (and unjustified) exemption from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain\nimport\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Failing to consider the nature of the claim when deciding whether an application is barred as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d raises other difficulties.  Consider a second-in-time habeas petition challenging an alleged violation that occurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for example, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time promised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of good-time credits.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule, it would appear that a habeas application challenging those alleged violations would be barred as \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d because it would be a second-in-time application challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.  That result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ principles and might work a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having unmoored the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d from its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court creates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is not what makes an application \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive,\xe2\x80\x9d then to what should a court look?  Finding no reference point in \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for a different peg.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different provision:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut this provision does not purport to create any prerequisites to \xc2\xa72244(b)\xe2\x80\x99s bar against \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications.  The accepted reading of the quoted language is that this is a mere \xe2\x80\x9cstatus requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 1 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa78.1, p.\xc2\xa0391 (5th ed. 2005).  The provision stands for the simple proposition that a petitioner must be held \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to the judgment of a State court\xe2\x80\x9d to be able to file any \xc2\xa72254(b) petition in the first place.  That reading also explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not only the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is being held but also \xe2\x80\x9cthe duration of sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 and \xe2\x80\xa6 the conditions under which that sentence is being served,\xe2\x80\x9d including rules such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe basis of parole\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgood time\xe2\x80\x9d credits.  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xa79.1, at 475\xe2\x80\x93481.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to the judgment of a State court\xe2\x80\x9d as a limitation on \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application bar is artificial.  The Court would amend \xc2\xa72244(b)(2) to read: \xe2\x80\x9cA claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application [<em>against the same judgment</em>] shall be dismissed.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is not what \xc2\xa72244(b)(2) says.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court wholly glosses over another significant problem with its atextual analysis.  The Court relies upon the notion that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n error made a second time is still a new error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  But in making this statement, the Court can mean one of two very different things:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it could mean that any error logically encompassed in a reentered judgment is a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d error.  A criminal \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d generally includes both the conviction and the sentence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a criminal judgment \xe2\x80\x9cmust set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court\xe2\x80\x99s findings, the adjudication, and the sentence\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U. S. 288</a>, 314, n.\xc2\xa02 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily includes the sentence imposed upon the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  This well-established principle applies in the federal habeas context, where petitioner is \xe2\x80\x9cin custody pursuant to the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(b).  A person cannot be held in custody \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d a sentence, but only pursuant to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>e.g., </em>one) judgment, which includes both the conviction and sentence.  See <em>Burton</em> v. <em>Stewart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/147/index.html">549 U. S. 147</a>, 156\xe2\x80\x93157 (2007) <em>(per curiam)</em> (explaining that AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations did not run until the judgment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cboth his conviction <em>and</em> sentence became final\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this principle, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today would allow a challenger in Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s position to raise any challenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment against him in his second application, since a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d judgment\xe2\x80\x94consisting of both the conviction and sentence\xe2\x80\x94has now been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently) occurred anew.  As an illustration, the state trial court here reentered the following judgment after resentencing: \xe2\x80\x9cIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY THE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the offense of aggravated murder \xe2\x80\xa6 and that Billy Joe Magwood is sentenced to death.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.  This would mean that Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s attorney could dig through anything that occurred from <em>voir dire</em> to the cross-examination of witnesses to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict, and raise any alleged errors for the first time in his second habeas application, all because the trial court did not properly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s first sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even further from the statutory text and conclude that only some parts of the reentered judgment are open to challenge by way of a second habeas application.  Magwood, for example, argues that he can only challenge previously unraised errors made during sentencing.  Brief for Petitioner 21, n.\xc2\xa08.  Indeed, Magwood goes further and suggests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a case where a court\xe2\x80\x99s order leads the trial court to revise only the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s term of supervised release.  <em>Id.,</em> at 28, n.\xc2\xa011.  If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the-criminal-judgment exception to the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood now raises is a \xe2\x80\x9cnew error\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  After all, Magwood did not challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas petition but only disputed that he should not get the death penalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court properly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.  The state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no reason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Magwood is death eligible.  It is hard to see how the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reconsider <em>sU. S.onte</em> its previous death-eligibility finding is a \xe2\x80\x9cnew error,\xe2\x80\x9d any more than its failure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken place at the guilt phase would have been new errors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends the approach dictated by <em>Panetti</em> \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderably undermine[s]\xe2\x80\x94if not render[s] superfluous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 14, the exceptions in \xc2\xa72244(b)(2), which allow a petitioner to bring a claim in a \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application based on certain factual discoveries or based on a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied retroactively.  The Court seems to be saying that applying <em>Panetti</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule would make the exceptions superfluous, because any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would necessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.  But the Court misconceives the scope of the rule that an application is only \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d if it raises for the first time a claim that could have been raised before.  A second petition raising a claim that could have been raised in a prior petition, even though strengthened by a new decision from this Court or based upon newly discovered evidence, is still \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus this subsequent application would only be permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection (b)(2) exception.  In fact, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach that limits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory, the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d bar does not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in Magwood\xe2\x80\x99s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) exceptions would have no operation in that context.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach disregards AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Panetti,</em> 551 U. S., at 945 (quoting <em>Miller-El</em>, 537 U. S., at 337).  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s newly created exception to the \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even the most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentencing would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims in his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he failed to raise in his first petition.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f reexamination of [a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federalism and comity, the offense increases when a State must defend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas proceeding on grounds not even raised in the first petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCleskey</em>, 499 U. S., at 492.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel exception would also allow the once-successful petitioner to reraise every argument against a sentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the first round of federal habeas review.  As respondents explain, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s theory, \xe2\x80\x9ca post-resentencing petitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the words, \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa72254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,\xe2\x80\x99 to his previously adjudicated petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 47.  Because traditional res judicata principles do not apply to federal habeas proceedings, see <em>Salinger</em> v. <em>Loisel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/224/index.html">265 U. S. 224</a>, 230 (1924), this would force federal courts to address twice (or thrice, or more) the same claims of error.  The State and the victims would have to bear anew the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0significant costs of federal habeas corpus review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCleskey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 490\xe2\x80\x93491, all because the petitioner previously succeeded on a wholly different, discrete, and possibly unrelated claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t will not take a court long to dispose of such claims where the court has already analyzed the legal issues,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, n.\xc2\xa015, misses the point.  This reassurance will be cold comfort to overworked state district attorneys, who will now have to waste time and resources writing briefs analyzing dozens of claims that should be barred by abuse-of-the-writ principles.  It is difficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals to do their best work, day after day, when they have to deal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously rejected or otherwise abusive claims.  But that is exactly what the Court is mandating, under a statute that was designed to require just the opposite result.  If the analysis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States will document the ill effects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion so that its costs and deficiencies are better understood if this issue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s new exception will apply not only to death penalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised claim appears arguably meritorious.  It will apply to all federal habeas petitions following a prior successful petition, most of which will not be in death cases and where the abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack merit.  And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision means that States subject to federal habeas review henceforth receive less recognition of a finality interest than the Federal Government does on direct review of federal criminal convictions.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Parker</em>, 101 F.\xc2\xa03d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cA party cannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in the first appeal because the remand did not affect it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach also turns AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s bar against \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive\xe2\x80\x9d applications into a one-way ratchet that favors habeas petitioners.  Unless today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is read to unduly limit <em>Panetti</em>, see <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, AEDPA still incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previously unavailable and unripe claims, see <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But after today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, AEDPA now \xe2\x80\x9cmodifie[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows petitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have won any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas petition.  The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new loophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge their sentences based on grounds they previously neglected to raise.  This is inconsistent with the understanding that AEDPA adds \xe2\x80\x9cnew restrictions on successive petitions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfurther restricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 664 (1996).</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all agree that claims then available, but not raised, would be barred.  But because he prevailed in his attack on one part of his sentencing proceeding the first time around, the Court rules that he is free, postsentencing, to pursue claims on federal habeas review that might have been raised earlier.  The Court is mistaken in concluding that Congress, in enacting a statute aimed at placing new restrictions on successive petitions, would have intended this irrational result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Magwood had every chance to raise his death-eligibility claim in his first habeas petition.  He has abused the writ by raising this claim for the first time in his second petition.  His application is therefore \xe2\x80\x9csecond or successive.\xe2\x80\x9d  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
