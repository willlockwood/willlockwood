But the provision, standing alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suit.  At the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such discrimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies.  Congress was concerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss on employees and their families and about discrimination based on illness, not sex.  Although the self-care provision offers some women a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional violations.  When the FMLA was enacted, Congress had no evidence that States were excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from their leave policies.

But his claim\xe2\x80\x94that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availability of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their different leave-usage patterns\xe2\x80\x95is unconvincing and does not comply with the requirements of City of Boerne.  Also, there are no congressional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer discrimination against women.

The fact that most single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect on women.  However, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. discrimination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where the \n \nFourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356\n.  Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional, the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.

The statute in question is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, \n\n107Stat.\n6, \n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72601 et seq.  The provision at issue requires employers, including state employers, to grant unpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition, provided other statutory requisites are met, particularly requirements that the total amount of annual leave taken under all the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions does not exceed a stated maximum.  \xc2\xa72612(a)(1)(d).  In agreement with every Court of Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now holds that suits against States under this provision are barred by the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity as sovereigns in our federal system.  See 626 F.\xc2\xa03d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below); Nelson v. University of Tex., 535 F.\xc2\xa03d 318 (CA5 2008); Miles v.

Subparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for reasons related to family care, and those three provisions are referred to here as the family-care provisions.  Hibbs held that Congress could subject the States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C), \xc2\xa72612(a)(1)(C).  That holding rested on evidence that States had family-leave policies that differentiated on the basis of sex and that States administered even neutral family-leave policies in ways that discriminated on the basis of sex.

The parties do not dispute the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that the Maryland Court of Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of the State for purposes of sovereign immunity.

In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence of a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination in family-leave policies.  States had facially discriminatory leave policies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men.  538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 730\xe2\x80\x93731.  States also administered facially neutral family-leave policies in gender-biased ways.  Id., at 732.  These practices reflected what Congress found to be a \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 731, a stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in earlier times, id., at 729.  Faced with \xe2\x80\x9cthe States\xe2\x80\x99 record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to give all employees the opportunity to take family-care leave was \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly targeted at the faultline between work and family\xe2\x80\x94precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 735, 738.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same cannot be said for requiring the States to give all employees the opportunity to take self-care leave.  Petitioner advances three arguments for allowing employees to recover damages from States that violate the FMLA\xe2\x80\x99s self-care provision:  The self-care provision standing alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyping; the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the burden on single parents.  But what the family-care provisions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks, namely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to address or prevent those violations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStanding alone, the self-care provision is not a valid abrogation of the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suit.  When the FMLA was enacted, \xe2\x80\x9cninety-five percent of full-time state- and local-government employees were covered by paid sick leave plans and ninety-six percent of such employees likewise enjoyed short-term disability protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for States of Texas et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (hereinafter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.\xc2\xa0S. Dept. of Labor, Employee Benefits in State and Local Governments 17\xe2\x80\x9326 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)).  The evidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory self-care leave policies or that they administered neutral self-care leave policies in a discriminatory way.  And there is scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported stereotype harbored by employers that women take self-care leave more often than men.  Congress considered evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cmen and women are out on medical leave approximately equally.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 101\xe2\x80\x9328, pt. 1, p. 15 (1989) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.).  Nothing in the record shows employers formulated self-care leave policies based on a contrary view.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWithout widespread evidence of sex discrimination or sex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.  The legislative history of the self-care provision reveals a concern for the economic burdens on the employee and the employee\xe2\x80\x99s family resulting from illness-related job loss and a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not sex.  See, e.g., S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x933, pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (1993); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 23.  In the findings pertinent to the self-care provision, the statute makes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex.  See \n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72601(a)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, with regard to family care Congress invoked concerns related to gender.  See \xc2\xa72601(a)(5) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ue to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true the self-care provision offers some women a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not congruent and proportional to any identified constitutional violations.  At the time of the FMLA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, \xe2\x80\x9cninety-five percent\xe2\x80\x9d of state employees had paid sick-leave plans at work, and \xe2\x80\x9cninety-six percent\xe2\x80\x9d had short-term disability protection.  Texas Brief 13\xe2\x80\x9314 (citing BLS Rept. 17\xe2\x80\x9326).  State employees presumably could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses under these policies, and Congress did not document any pattern of States excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from sick-leave or disability-leave policies.  \xe2\x80\x9cCongress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida Prepaid, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 644.  It follows that abrogating the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suits for damages for failure to give self-care leave is not a congruent and proportional remedy if the existing state leave policies would have sufficed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs an alternative justification for the self-care provision, it has been suggested that the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care provisions.  Petitioner argues that employers may assume women are more likely to take family-care leave than men and that the FMLA therefore offers up to 12 weeks of leave for family care and self care combined.  According to petitioner, when the self-care provision is coupled with the family-care provisions, the self-care provision could reduce the difference in the expected number of weeks of FMLA leave that different employees take for different reasons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that self-care leave could have this effect does not mean that it would.  If, for example, women are expected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and men to take 10, and women and men are each expected to take 5 days of self-care leave per year, the difference in the expected number of days of leave and cost to the employer remains the same regardless of the availability of self-care leave.  Congress made no findings, and received no specific testimony, to suggest the availability of self-care leave equalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and women will take.  Even if women take family-care leave more often than men, men do not take self-care leave more often than women; and there is little evidence that employers assume they do.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 15.  Petitioner suggests that some women will be expected to take all 12 weeks of leave under the FMLA for family-care purposes, and therefore that any amount of self-care leave taken by men will diminish the difference in the amount of FMLA leave taken by men and women.  But there is little evidence to support petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s assumption about the magnitude of women\xe2\x80\x99s expected FMLA leave for family-care purposes.  And men are only expected to take five days of sick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision diminishes the difference in expected leave time by a maximum of five days.  And that is only to the extent women use all their available FMLA leave for family-care reasons.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s overly complicated argument about how the self-care provision works in tandem with the family-care provisions is unconvincing and in the end does not comply with the clear requirements of City of Boerne.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first defense of the self-care provision contradicts his second defense of the provision.  In the first defense, the Court is told employers assume women take more self-care leave than men.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  In the second defense, the Court is told the self-care provision provides an incentive to hire women that will counteract the incentives created by the family-care provisions because employers assume women take more family-care leave than men.  But if the first defense is correct, the second defense is wrong.  In other words, if employers assume women take self-care leave more often than men (the first defense), a self-care provision will not provide an incentive to hire women.  To the contrary, the self-care provision would provide an incentive to discriminate against women.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is \xe2\x80\x9clittle support in the record for the concerns that supposedly animated\xe2\x80\x9d the self-care provision.  Florida Prepaid, supra, at 639.  Only supposition and conjecture support the contention that the self-care provision is necessary to make the family-care provisions effective.  The evidence documented in support of the self-care provision is, to a large degree, unrelated to sex discrimination, or to the administration of the family-care provisions.  See supra, at 7.  Congress made no findings and did not cite specific or detailed evidence to show how the self-care provision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces an employer\xe2\x80\x99s incentives to discriminate against women.  And \xe2\x80\x9cCongress .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state\xe2\x80\x9d sick-leave policies.  Florida Prepaid, supra, at 644; see Garrett, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, more is required to sub- ject unconsenting States to suits for damages, particularly where, as here, it is for violations of a provision (the self-care provision) that is a supposedly preventive step in aid of already preventive provisions (the family-care provisions).  See Florida Prepaid, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 642 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legislative record still provides little support for the prop- osition that Congress sought to remedy a \n \nFourteenth Amendment violation in enacting the Patent Remedy Act\xe2\x80\x9d); Kimel, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 88 (\xe2\x80\x9cOne means by which we have made such a determination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is by examining the legislative record containing the reasons for Congress\xe2\x80\x99 action\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \xe2\x80\x9cfew fleeting references\xe2\x80\x9d to how self-care leave is inseparable from family-care leave fall short of what is required for a valid abrogation of States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suits for damages.  Florida Prepaid, supra, at 644.  These \xe2\x80\x9cisolated sentences clipped from floor debates\xe2\x80\x9d and testimony, Kimel, supra, at 89, are stated as conclusions, unsupported by evidence or findings about how the self-care provision interrelates to the family-care provisions to counteract employers\xe2\x80\x99 incentives to discriminate against women.  Congress must rely on more than abstract generalities to subject the States to suits for damages.  Otherwise, Congress could choose to combat the purported effects of the family-care provisions by allowing employees to sue States that do not permit employees to take vacation time under the FMLA.  There is nothing in particular about self-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal reason, that connects it to gender discrimination.  And when the issue, as here, is whether subparagraph (D) can abrogate a State\xe2\x80\x99s immunity from damages, there is no sufficient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated nexus, between self-care leave and gender discrimination by state employers.  Documented discrimination against women in the general workplace is a persistent, unfortunate reality, and, we must assume, a still prevalent wrong.  An explicit purpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to improve workplace conditions for women.  See 29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72601(b)(4), (5).  But States may not be subject to suits for damages based on violations of a comprehensive statute unless Congress has identified a specific pattern of constitutional violations by state employers.  See City of Boerne, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 532.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s last defense of the self-care provision is that the provision helps single parents retain their jobs when they become ill.  This, however, does not explain how the provision remedies or prevents constitutional violations.  The fact that most single parents happen to be women, see, e.g., S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x933, at 7, demonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at remedying employers\xe2\x80\x99 neutral leave restrictions which have a disparate effect on women.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. discrimination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such evidence alone is insufficient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where the \n \nFourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garrett, supra, at 372\xe2\x80\x93373; see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 53\n\xe2\x80\x9383 (2001) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis, \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229, \n239 (1976)\n.  To the extent, then, that the self-care provision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate impact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional violations.  Because, moreover, it is \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely that many of the [neutral leave policies] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. affected by\xe2\x80\x9d the self-care provision are unconstitutional, \xe2\x80\x9cthe scope of the [self-care provision is] out of proportion to its supposed remedial or preventive objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kimel, supra, at 82; see City of Boerne, supra, at 519.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOf course, a State need not assert its \n \nEleventh Amendment immunity from suits for damages.  See, e.g., Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (\xe2\x80\x9cA State .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may choose to waive its immunity in federal court at its pleasure\xe2\x80\x9d).  Discrimination against women is contrary to the public policy of the State of Maryland, see, e.g., Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. State Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa720\xe2\x80\x93606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has conceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.  If the State agrees with petitioner that damages liability for violations of the self-care provision is necessary to combat discrimination against women, the State may waive its immunity or create a parallel state law cause of action. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a consequence of our constitutional design, money damages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants.  See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n29 (1981)\n.  Subjecting States to suits for damages pursuant to \xc2\xa75 requires more than a theory for why abrogating the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity aids in, or advances, a stated congressional purpose.  To abrogate the States\xe2\x80\x99 immunity from suits for damages under \xc2\xa75, Congress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations and tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the documented violations.  It failed to do so when it allowed employees to sue States for violations of the FMLA\xe2\x80\x99s self-care provision.

In so declaring, the plurality undervalues the language, purpose, and history of the FMLA, and the self-care provision\xe2\x80\x99s important role in the statutory scheme.

See 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 738\xe2\x80\x93739.  FMLA leave is unpaid.

Self-care leave, I would hold, is a key part of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 endeavor to make it feasible for women to work and have families.  See 1991 Senate Report\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9326 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis legislation is essential if the nation is to address the dramatic changes that have occurred in the American workforce in recent years.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

By the year 2000, about three out of every four American children will have mothers in the workforce.\xe2\x80\x9d).  By reducing an employer\xe2\x80\x99s perceived incentive to avoid hiring women, \xc2\xa72612(a)(1)(D) lessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise to the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart.  The plurality offers no legitimate ground to dilute the force of the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo additional points.  First, this Court reached a different conclusion than the one I reach here in Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356 (2001)\n, and Kimel, \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 62\n.  In those cases, as we observed in Hibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age discrimination, respectively.  Neither disability nor age is a suspect classification under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the basis of disability or age as long as the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  See Garrett, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 366\xe2\x80\x93367; Kimel, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 83\xe2\x80\x9384.  Therefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress needed to rely on a pattern of irrational state discrimination on the basis of disability or age.  See Garrett, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 89.  Here, however, Congress homed in on gender discrimination, which triggers heightened review.  See United States v. Virginia, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515, \n531 (1996)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cParties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for that action.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was [therefore] easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.\xe2\x80\x9d Hibbs, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 736.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not authorize state employers to violate the FMLA, although it does block injured employees from suing for monetary relief.  The self-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legislation, Maryland concedes, and consequently binds the states, as well as the private sector.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25; Brief for Respondents 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  An employee wrongly denied self-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursuant to Ex parte Young, \n\n209 U.\xc2\xa0S. 123 (1908)\n, seek injunctive relief against the responsible state official.  See Brief for Respondents 33.  Moreover, the U.\xc2\xa0S. Department of Labor may bring an action against a state for violating the self-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72617(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3), (d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality pays scant attention to the overarching aim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work while sustaining family life.  Over the course of eight years, Congress considered the problem of workplace discrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to reduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs.  Essential to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared to women only.  Congress thereby reduced employers\xe2\x80\x99 incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women\xe2\x80\x99s economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more egalitarian relationship at home and at work.  The self-care provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my view, a valid exercise of congressional power under \xc2\xa75 of the \n \nFourteenth Amendment.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0I remain of the view that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I Commerce Clause power.
