One month later, the Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration sent a joint surveillance team to Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 home.  Detective Pedraja was part of that team. He watched the home for fifteen minutes and saw no vehicles in the driveway or activity around the home, and could not see inside because the blinds were drawn. \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetective Pedraja then approached Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 home accompanied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a trained canine handler who had just arrived at the scene with his drug-sniffing dog.  The dog was trained to detect the scent of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs, indicating the presence of any of these substances through particular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDetective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash, owing in part to the dog\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwild\xe2\x80\x9d nature, App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9335, and tendency to dart around erratically while searching.  As the dog approached Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 front porch, he apparently sensed one of the odors he had been trained to detect, and began energetically exploring the area for the strongest point source of that odor.  As Detective Bartelt explained, the dog \xe2\x80\x9cbegan tracking that airborne odor by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. tracking back and forth,\xe2\x80\x9d engaging in what is called \xe2\x80\x9cbracketing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cback and forth, back and forth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at A\xe2\x80\x93 33 to A\xe2\x80\x9334.  Detective Bartelt gave the dog \xe2\x80\x9cthe full six feet of the leash plus whatever safe distance [he could] give him\xe2\x80\x9d to do this\xe2\x80\x94he testified that he needed to give the dog \xe2\x80\x9cas much distance as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at A\xe2\x80\x9335.  And Detective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring, so that he would not \xe2\x80\x9cget knocked over\xe2\x80\x9d when the dog was \xe2\x80\x9cspinning around trying to find\xe2\x80\x9d the source.  Id., at A\xe2\x80\x9338.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat, which is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor\xe2\x80\x99s strongest point.  Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog away from the door and returned to his vehicle.  He left the scene after informing Detective Pedraja that there had been a positive alert for narcotics.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the basis of what he had learned at the home, De- tective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to search the residence.  When the warrant was executed later that day, Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the search revealed marijuana plants, and he was charged with trafficking in cannabis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana plants on the ground that the canine investigation was an unreasonable search.  The trial court granted the motion, and the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed.  On a petition for discretionary review, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Third District Court of Appeal and approved the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to suppress, holding (as relevant here) that the use of the trained narcotics dog to investigate Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 home was a \n \nFourth Amendment search unsupported by probable cause, rendering invalid the warrant based upon information gathered in that search.  73 So. 3d 34 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, limited to the question of whether the officers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior was a search within the meaning of the \n \nFourth Amendment.  565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFourth Amendment provides in relevant part that the \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Amendment establishes a simple baseline, one that for much of our history formed the exclusive basis for its protections: When \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government obtains information by physically intruding\xe2\x80\x9d on persons, houses, papers, or effects, \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98search\xe2\x80\x99 within the original meaning of the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d has \xe2\x80\x9cun- doubtedly occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Jones, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa03 (2012) (slip op., at 6, n.\xc2\xa03).  By reason of our decision in Katz v. United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967)\n, property rights \xe2\x80\x9care not the sole measure of \n \nFourth Amendment violations,\xe2\x80\x9d Soldal v. Cook County, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56, \n64 (1992)\n\xe2\x80\x94but though Katz may add to the baseline, it does not subtract anything from the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Government does engage in [a] physi- cal intrusion of a constitutionally protected area,\xe2\x80\x9d United States v. Knotts, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276, \n286 (1983)\n (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat principle renders this case a straightforward one.  The officers were gathering information in an area belonging to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house\xe2\x80\x94in the curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys protection as part of the home itself.  And they gathered that information by physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cindicates with some precision the places and things encompassed by its protections\xe2\x80\x9d: persons, houses, papers, and effects.  Oliver v. United States, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170, \n176 (1984)\n.  The \n \nFourth Amendment does not, therefore, prevent all investigations conducted on private property; for example, an officer may (subject to Katz) gather information in what we have called \xe2\x80\x9copen fields\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if those fields are privately owned\xe2\x80\x94because such fields are not enumerated in the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Hester v. United States, \n\n265 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57 (1924)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut when it comes to the \n \nFourth Amendment, the home is first among equals.  At the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvery core\xe2\x80\x9d stands \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental in- trusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Silverman v. United States, \n\n365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505, \n511 (1961)\n.  This right would be of little practical value if the State\xe2\x80\x99s agents could stand in a home\xe2\x80\x99s porch or side garden and trawl for evidence with impunity; the right to retreat would be significantly diminished if the police could enter a man\xe2\x80\x99s property to observe his repose from just outside the front window.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe therefore regard the area \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately surrounding and associated with the home\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what our cases call the curtilage\xe2\x80\x94as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the home itself for \n \nFourth Amendment purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oliver, supra, at 180.  That principle has ancient and durable roots.  Just as the distinction between the home and the open fields is \xe2\x80\x9cas old as the common law,\xe2\x80\x9d Hester, supra, at 59, so too is the identity of home and what Blackstone called the \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage or homestall,\xe2\x80\x9d for the \xe2\x80\x9chouse protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 223, 225 (1769).  This area around the home is \xe2\x80\x9cintimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically,\xe2\x80\x9d and is where \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy expectations are most heightened.\xe2\x80\x9d  California v.

Here there is no doubt that the officers entered it: The front porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the home and \xe2\x80\x9cto which the activity of home life extends.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSince the officers\xe2\x80\x99 investigation took place in a constitutionally protected area, we turn to the question of whether it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical in- trusion.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  While law enforcement officers need not \xe2\x80\x9cshield their eyes\xe2\x80\x9d when passing by the home \xe2\x80\x9con public thoroughfares,\xe2\x80\x9d Ciraolo, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 213, an officer\xe2\x80\x99s leave to gather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps off those thoroughfares and enters the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protected areas.  In permitting, for example, visual observation of the home from \xe2\x80\x9cpublic navigable airspace,\xe2\x80\x9d we were careful to note that it was done \xe2\x80\x9cin a physically nonintrusive manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

As it is undisputed that the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of their companion\xe2\x80\x99s firmly planted on the constitutionally protected extension of Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 home, the only question is whether he had given his leave (even implicitly) for them to do so.

Alexandria, \n\n341 U. S. 622, \n626 (1951)\n.  This implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger longer) leave.  Complying with the terms of that traditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal knowledge; it is generally managed without incident by the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, a police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home and knock, precisely because that is \xe2\x80\x9cno more than any private citizen might do.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kentucky v. King, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut introducing a trained police dog to explore the area around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating evidence is something else.  There is no customary invitation to do that.  An invitation to engage in canine forensic investigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of hanging a knocker.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  To find a visitor knocking on the door is routine (even if sometimes unwelcome); to spot that same visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector, or marching his bloodhound into the garden before saying hello and asking permission, would inspire most of us to\xe2\x80\x94well, call the police.  The scope of a license\xe2\x80\x94express or implied\xe2\x80\x94is limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific purpose.  Consent at a traffic stop to an officer\xe2\x80\x99s checking out an anonymous tip that there is a body in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage through the trunk for narcotics.  Here, the background social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not invite him there to conduct a search.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State points to our decisions holding that the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant.  See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011); Whren v. United States, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 806 (1996)\n. But those cases merely hold that a stop or search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by the fact that the officer\xe2\x80\x99s real reason for making the stop or search has nothing to do with the validating reason.  Thus, the defendant will not be heard to complain that although he was speeding the officer\xe2\x80\x99s real reason for the stop was racial harassment.  See id., at 810, 813.  Here, however, the question before the court is precisely whether the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was an objectively reasonable search.  As we have described, that depends upon whether the officers had an implied license to enter the porch, which in turn depends upon the purpose for which they entered.  Here, their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to conduct a search, which is not what anyone would think he had license to do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State argues that investigation by a forensic narcotics dog by definition cannot implicate any legitimate privacy interest.  The State cites for authority our decisions in United States v. Place, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 696 (1983)\n, United States v. Jacobsen, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 109 (1984)\n, and Illinois v. Caballes, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405 (2005)\n, which held, respectively, that canine inspection of luggage in an airport, chemical testing of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in transit, and canine inspection of an automobile during a lawful traffic stop, do not violate the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d described in Katz.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJust last Term, we considered an argument much like this.  Jones held that tracking an automobile\xe2\x80\x99s where- abouts using a physically-mounted GPS receiver is a \n \nFourth Amendment search.  The Government argued that the Katz standard \xe2\x80\x9cshow[ed] that no search occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d as the defendant had \xe2\x80\x9cno \xe2\x80\x98reasonable expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in his whereabouts on the public roads, Jones, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\xe2\x80\x94a proposition with at least as much support in our case law as the one the State marshals here.  See, e.g., United States v. Knotts, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276, \n278 (1983)\n.  But because the GPS receiver had been physically mounted on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s automobile (thus intruding on his \xe2\x80\x9ceffects\xe2\x80\x9d), we held that tracking the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s movements was a search: a person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFourth Amendment rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jones, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The Katz reasonable-expectations test \xe2\x80\x9chas been added to, not substituted for,\xe2\x80\x9d the traditional property-based understanding of the \n \nFourth Amendment, and so is unnecessary to consider when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas.

One virtue of the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s property-rights baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy.  That the officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 property to gather evidence is enough to establish that a search occurred.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor a related reason we find irrelevant the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument (echoed by the dissent) that forensic dogs have been commonly used by police for centuries.  This argument is apparently directed to our holding in Kyllo v. United States, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27 (2001)\n, that surveillance of the home is a search where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government uses a device that is not in general public use\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cexplore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 40 (emphasis added).  But the implication of that statement (inclusio unius est exclusio alterius) is that when the government uses a physical intrusion to explore details of the home (including its curtilage), the antiquity of the tools that they bring along is irrelevant.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe government\xe2\x80\x99s use of trained police dogs to inves- tigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a \xe2\x80\x9csearch\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the \n \nFourth Amendment.

A stranger comes to the front door of your home carrying super-high-powered binoculars.  See ante, at 7, n.\xc2\xa03.  He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t knock or say hello.  Instead, he stands on the porch and uses the binoculars to peer through your windows, into your home\xe2\x80\x99s furthest corners.

Has your \xe2\x80\x9cvisitor\xe2\x80\x9d trespassed on your property, exceeding the license you have granted to members of the public to, say, drop off the mail or distribute campaign flyers?  Yes, he has.  And has he also invaded your \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d by nosing into intimacies you sensibly thought protected from disclosure?  Katz v. United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347, \n360 (1967)\n (Harlan, J., concurring).

Here, police officers came to Joelis Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 door with a super-sensitive instrument, which they deployed to detect things inside that they could not perceive unassisted.  The equip-ment they used was animal, not mineral.  But contra the dissent, see post, at 2 (opinion of Alito, J.) (noting the ubiquity of dogs in American households), that is of no significance in determining whether a search occurred.  Detective Bartelt\xe2\x80\x99s dog was not your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s pet, come to your porch on a leisurely stroll.  As this Court discussed earlier this Term, drug-detection dogs are highly trained tools of law enforcement, geared to respond in distinctive ways to specific scents so as to convey clear and reliable information to their human partners.  See Florida v. Harris, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013) (slip op. at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 7\xe2\x80\x938).  They are to the poodle down the street as high-powered binoculars are to a piece of plain glass.  Like the binoculars, a drug-detection dog is a specialized device for discovering objects not in plain view (or plain smell).  And as in the hypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a home\xe2\x80\x94the most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of all the places and things the \n \nFourth Amendment protects.  Was this activity a trespass?  Yes, as the Court holds to-day.  Was it also an invasion of privacy?  Yes, that as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court today treats this case under a property rubric; I write separately to note that I could just as happily have decided it by looking to Jardines\xe2\x80\x99 privacy interests.  A decision along those lines would have looked .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, much like this one.

It would have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98privacy expectations are most heightened\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the home and the surrounding area.  Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (quoting California v. Ciraolo, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207, \n213 (1986)\n).  And it would have determined that police officers invade those shared expectations when they use trained canine assistants to reveal within the confines of a home what they could not otherwise have found there.  See ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, and nn. 2\xe2\x80\x933.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not surprising that in a case involving a search of a home, property concepts and privacy concepts should so align.

If officers can smell drugs coming from a house, they can use that information; a human sniff is not a search, we can all agree.  But it does not follow that a person loses his expectation of privacy in the many scents within his home that (his own nose capably tells him) are not usually detectible by humans standing outside.

This license is not limited to persons who intend to speak to an occupant or who actually do so.  (Mail carriers and persons delivering packages and flyers are examples of individuals who may lawfully approach a front door without intending to converse.)  Nor is the license restricted to categories of visitors whom an occupant of the dwelling is likely to welcome; as the Court acknowledges, this license applies even to \xe2\x80\x9csolicitors, hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  Thus, the amount of time that Franky and the detective remained at the front porch was even less.  The Court also fails to mention that, while Detective Bartelt apparently did not personally smell the odor of marijuana coming from the house, another officer who subsequently stood on the front porch, Detective Pedraja, did notice that smell and was able to identify it.

Breard v. Alexandria, \n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622, \n626 (1951)\n; Lakin v. Ames, 64 Mass. 198, 220 (1852); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Non-Contract Law \xc2\xa7823, p. 378 (1889).  This rule encompasses categories of visitors whom most homeowners almost certainly wish to allow to approach their front doors\xe2\x80\x94friends, relatives, mail carriers, persons making deliveries.  But it also reaches categories of visitors who are less universally welcome\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csolicitors,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chawkers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpeddlers,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.  The law might attempt to draw fine lines between categories of welcome and unwelcome visitors, distinguishing, for example, between tolerable and intolerable door-to-door peddlers (Girl Scouts selling cookies versus adults selling aluminum siding) or be- tween police officers on agreeable and disagreeable missions (gathering information about a bothersome neighbor versus asking potentially incriminating questions).  But the law of trespass has not attempted such a difficult taxonomy.  See Desnick v. American Broadcasting Cos., 44 F.\xc2\xa03d 1345, 1351 (CA7 1995) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]onsent to an entry is often given legal effect even though the entrant has intentions that if known to the owner of the property would cause him for perfectly understandable and generally ethical or at least lawful reasons to revoke his consent\xe2\x80\x9d); cf.

A visitor must stick to the path that is typically used to approach a front door, such as a paved walkway.  A visitor cannot traipse through the garden, meander into the backyard, or take other circuitous detours that veer from the pathway that a visitor would customarily use.  See, e.g., Robinson v.

A stranger may not plop down uninvited to spend the afternoon in the front porch rocking chair, or throw down a sleeping bag to spend the night, or lurk on the front porch, looking in the windows\xe2\x80\x9d).

For example, mail carriers, persons making deliveries, and in- dividuals distributing flyers may leave the items they are carrying and depart without making any attempt to converse.  A pedestrian or motorist looking for a particular address may walk up to a front door in order to check a house number that is hard to see from the sidewalk or road.  A neighbor who knows that the residents are away may approach the door to retrieve an accumulation of newspapers that might signal to a potential burglar that the house is unoccupied.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the majority acknowledges, this implied license to approach the front door extends to the police.  See ante, at 6.  As we recognized in Kentucky v. King, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), police officers do not engage in a search when they approach the front door of a residence and seek to engage in what is termed a \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., knocking on the door and seeking to speak to an occupant for the purpose of gathering evidence.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any private citizen might do\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also 1 LaFave \xc2\xa72.3(e), at 592 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not objectionable for an officer to come upon that part of the property which has been opened to public common use\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Even when the objective of a \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk\xe2\x80\x9d is to obtain evidence that will lead to the homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s arrest and prosecution, the license to approach still applies.  In other words, gathering evidence\xe2\x80\x94even damning evidence\xe2\x80\x94is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the license to approach.  And when officers walk up to the front door of a house, they are permitted to see, hear, and smell whatever can be detected from a lawful vantage point.  California v.

What this means, I take it, is that anyone aware of what Detective Bartelt did would infer that his subjective purpose was to gather evidence.  But if this is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s point, then a standard \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk\xe2\x80\x9d and most other police visits would likewise constitute searches.

That is certainly the objective of a \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court offers no meaningful way of distinguishing the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of Detective Bartelt\xe2\x80\x99s conduct here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court contends that a \xe2\x80\x9cknock and talk\xe2\x80\x9d is different because it involves talking, and \xe2\x80\x9call are invited\xe2\x80\x9d to do that.

But in the entire body of common-law decisions, the Court has not found a single case holding that a visitor to the front door of a home commits a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by a dog on a leash.  On the contrary, the common law allowed even unleashed dogs to wander on private property without committing a trespass.  G. Williams, Liability for Animals 136\xe2\x80\x93146 (1939); J.

The antiquity of this practice is evidenced by a Scottish law from 1318 that made it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cdisturb a tracking dog or the men coming with it for pursuing thieves or seizing malefactors.\xe2\x80\x9d  K. Brown et\xc2\xa0al., The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, (St Andrews, 2007\xe2\x80\x932013), online at http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9.  If bringing a tracking dog to the front door of a home constituted a trespass, one would expect at least one case to have arisen during the past 800 years.  But the Court has found none.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, the real law of trespass provides no support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today.  While the Court claims that its reasoning has \xe2\x80\x9cancient and durable roots,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 4, its trespass rule is really a newly struck counterfeit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurring opinion attempts to provide an alternative ground for today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, namely, that Detective Bartelt\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectations of privacy.  But we have already rejected a very similar, if not identical argument, see Illinois v. Caballes, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405\n\xe2\x80\x93410 (2005), and in any event I see no basis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have a reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate from the dwelling and reach spots where members of the public may lawfully stand.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is clear that the occupant of a house has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to odors that can be smelled by human beings who are standing in such places.  See United States v. Johns, \n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478, \n482 (1985)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the officers came closer and detected the distinct odor of marihuana, they had probable cause to believe that the vehicles contained contraband\xe2\x80\x9d); United States v. Ventresca, \n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 102, \n111 (1965)\n (scent of ferment- ing mash supported probable cause for warrant); United States v. Johnston, 497 F.\xc2\xa02d 397, 398 (CA9 1974) (there is no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable expectation of privacy from drug agents with inquisitive nostrils\xe2\x80\x9d).  And I would not draw a line between odors that can be smelled by humans and those that are detectible only by dogs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider the situation from the point of view of the occupant of a building in which marijuana is grown or methamphetamine is manufactured.  Would such an oc- cupant reason as follows?  \xe2\x80\x9cI know that odors may emanate from my building and that atmospheric conditions, such as the force and direction of the wind, may affect the strength of those odors when they reach a spot where members of the public may lawfully stand.  I also know that some people have a much more acute sense of smell than others,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and I have no idea who might be standing in one of the spots in question when the odors from my house reach that location.  In addition, I know that odors coming from my building, when they reach these locations, may be strong enough to be detected by a dog.  But I am confident that they will be so faint that they cannot be smelled by any human being.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a finely tuned expectation would be entirely unrealistic, and I see no evidence that society is prepared to recognize it as reasonable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn an attempt to show that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the odor of marijuana wafting from his house, the concurrence argues that this case is just like Kyllo v. United States, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27 (2001)\n, which  held that police officers conducted a search when they used a thermal imaging device to detect heat emanating from a house.  Ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Kagan, J.).  This Court, however, has already rejected the argument that the use of a drug-sniffing dog is the same as the use of a thermal imaging device.  See Caballes, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 409\xe2\x80\x93410.  The very argument now advanced by the concurrence appears in Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s Caballes dissent.  See id., at 413, and n.\xc2\xa03.  But the Court was not persuaded.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContrary to the interpretation propounded by the concurrence, Kyllo is best understood as a decision about the use of new technology.  The Kyllo Court focused on the fact that the thermal imaging device was a form of \xe2\x80\x9csense-enhancing technology\xe2\x80\x9d that was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in general public use,\xe2\x80\x9d and it expressed concern that citizens would be \xe2\x80\x9cat the mercy of advancing technology\xe2\x80\x9d if its use was not restricted.  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  A dog, however, is not a new form of \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology or a \xe2\x80\x9cdevice.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, as noted, the use of dogs\xe2\x80\x99 acute sense of smell in law enforcement dates back many centuries.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurrence suggests that a Kyllo-based decision would be \xe2\x80\x9cmuch like\xe2\x80\x9d the actual decision of the Court, but that is simply not so.  The holding of the Court is based on what the Court sees as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3 (quoting United States v. Knotts, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 276, \n286 (1983)\n (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment)).  As a result, it does not apply when a dog alerts while on a public sidewalk or street or in the corridor of a building to which the dog and handler have been lawfully admitted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s Kyllo-based approach would have a much wider reach.  When the police used the thermal imaging device in Kyllo, they were on a public street, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 29, and \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted no trespass.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3.  Therefore, if a dog\xe2\x80\x99s nose is just like a thermal imaging device for \n \nFourth Amendment purposes, a search would occur if a dog alerted while on a public sidewalk or in the corridor of an apartment building.  And the same would be true if the dog was trained to sniff, not for marijuana, but for more dangerous quarry, such as explosives or for a violent fugitive or kidnaped child.  I see no ground for hampering legitimate law enforcement in this way.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe conduct of the police officer in this case did not constitute a trespass and did not violate respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectations of privacy.  I would hold that this conduct was not a search, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See, e.g., Sloane, Dogs in War, Police Work and on Patrol, 46 J.
