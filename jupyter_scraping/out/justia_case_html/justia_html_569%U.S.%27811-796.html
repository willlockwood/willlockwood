It sells the seeds subject to a licensing agreement that permits farmers to plant the purchased seed in one, and only one, growing season.  Growers may consume or sell the resulting crops, but may not save any of the harvested soybeans for replanting.  Petitioner Bowman purchased Roundup Ready soybean seed for his first crop of each growing season from a company associated with Monsanto and followed the terms of the licensing agreement.  But to reduce costs for his riskier late-season planting, Bowman purchased soybeans intended for consumption from a grain elevator; planted them; treated the plants with glyphosate, killing all plants without the Roundup Ready trait; harvested the resulting soybeans that contained that trait; and saved some of these harvested seeds to use in his late-season planting the next season.  After discovering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement.  Bowman raised the defense of patent exhaustion, which gives the purchaser of a patented article, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or resell that article.  The District Court rejected Bowman\xe2\x80\x99s defense and the Federal Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder\xe2\x80\x99s permission.

However, the doctrine restricts the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s rights only as to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular article\xe2\x80\x9d sold, id., at 251; it leaves untouched the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prevent a buyer from making new copies of the patented item.  By planting and harvesting Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented seeds, Bowman made additional copies of Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented invention, and his conduct thus falls outside the protections of patent exhaustion.  Were this otherwise, Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patent would provide scant benefit.  After Monsanto sold its first seed, other seed companies could produce the patented seed to compete with Monsanto, and farmers would need to buy seed only once.

But it is really Bowman who is asking for an exception to the well-settled rule that exhaustion does not extend to the right to make new copies of the patented item.  If Bowman was granted that exception, patents on seeds would retain little value.  Further, applying the normal rule will allow farmers to make effective use of patented seeds.  Bowman, who purchased seeds intended for consumption, stands in a peculiarly poor position to argue that he cannot make effective use of his soybeans.  Bowman conceded that he knew of no other farmer who planted soybeans bought from a grain elevator.  In the more ordinary case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed from Monsanto or an affiliate, he will be able to plant it in accordance with Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s license to make one crop.

Such a sale, however, does not allow the purchaser to make new copies of the patented invention.  The question in this case is whether a farmer who buys patented seeds may reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder\xe2\x80\x99s permission.  We hold that he may not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Monsanto invented a genetic modification that enables soybean plants to survive exposure to glyphosate, the active ingredient in many herbicides (including Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s own Roundup).  Monsanto markets soybean seed containing this altered genetic material as Roundup Ready seed.  Farmers planting that seed can use a glyphosate-based herbicide to kill weeds without damaging their crops.  Two patents issued to Monsanto cover various aspects of its Roundup Ready technology, including a seed in-corporating the genetic alteration.  See Supp. App. SA1\xe2\x80\x9321 (U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent Nos. 5,352,605 and RE39,247E); see also 657 F.\xc2\xa03d 1341, 1343\xe2\x80\x931344 (CA Fed. 2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMonsanto sells, and allows other companies to sell, Roundup Ready soybean seeds to growers who assent to a special licensing agreement.  See App. 27a.  That agreement permits a grower to plant the purchased seeds in one (and only one) season.  He can then consume the resulting crop or sell it as a commodity, usually to a grain elevator or agricultural processor.  See 657 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1344\xe2\x80\x931345.  But under the agreement, the farmer may not save any of the harvested soybeans for replanting, nor may he supply them to anyone else for that purpose.  These restrictions reflect the ease of producing new generations of Roundup Ready seed.  Because glyphosate resistance comes from the seed\xe2\x80\x99s genetic material, that trait is passed on from the planted seed to the harvested soybeans: Indeed, a single Roundup Ready seed can grow a plant containing dozens of genetically identical beans, each of which, if replanted, can grow another such plant\xe2\x80\x94and so on and so on.  See App. 100a.  The agreement\xe2\x80\x99s terms prevent the farmer from co-opting that process to produce his own Roundup Ready seeds, forcing him instead to buy from Monsanto each season.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Vernon Bowman is a farmer in Indiana who, it is fair to say, appreciates Roundup Ready soybean seed.  He purchased Roundup Ready each year, from a company affiliated with Monsanto, for his first crop of the season.  In accord with the agreement just described, he used all of that seed for planting, and sold his entire crop to a grain elevator (which typically would resell it to an agricultural processor for human or animal consumption).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBowman, however, devised a less orthodox approach for his second crop of each season.  Because he thought such late-season planting \xe2\x80\x9crisky,\xe2\x80\x9d he did not want to pay the premium price that Monsanto charges for Roundup Ready seed.  Id., at 78a; see Brief for Petitioner 6.  He therefore went to a grain elevator; purchased \xe2\x80\x9ccommodity soybeans\xe2\x80\x9d intended for human or animal consumption; and planted them in his fields.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Those soybeans came from prior harvests of other local farmers.  And because most of those farmers also used Roundup Ready seed, Bowman could anticipate that many of the purchased soybeans would contain Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented technology.  When he applied a glyphosate-based herbicide to his fields, he confirmed that this was so; a significant proportion of the new plants survived the treatment, and produced in their turn a new crop of soybeans with the Roundup Ready trait.  Bowman saved seed from that crop to use in his late-season planting the next year\xe2\x80\x94and then the next, and the next, until he had harvested eight crops in that way.  Each year, that is, he planted saved seed from the year before (sometimes adding more soybeans bought from the grain elevator), sprayed his fields with glyphosate to kill weeds (and any non-resistant plants), and produced a new crop of glyphosate-resistant\xe2\x80\x94i.e., Roundup Ready\xe2\x80\x94soybeans.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter discovering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman for infringing its patents on Roundup Ready seed.  Bowman raised patent exhaustion as a defense, arguing that Monsanto could not control his use of the soybeans because they were the subject of a prior authorized sale (from local farmers to the grain elevator).  The District Court rejected that argument, and awarded damages to Monsanto of $84,456.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  It reasoned that patent exhaustion did not protect Bowman because he had \xe2\x80\x9ccreated a newly infringing article.\xe2\x80\x9d  657 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1348.  The \xe2\x80\x9cright to use\xe2\x80\x9d a patented article following an authorized sale, the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not include the right to construct an essentially new article on the template of the original, for the right to make the article remains with the patentee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, Bowman could not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98replicate\xe2\x80\x99 Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented technology by planting it in the ground to create newly infringing genetic material, seeds, and plants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari to consider the important question of patent law raised in this case, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), and now affirm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe doctrine of patent exhaustion limits a patentee\xe2\x80\x99s right to control what others can do with an article embodying or containing an invention.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Under the doctrine, \xe2\x80\x9cthe initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.\xe2\x80\x9d  Quanta Computer, Inc. v.

And by \xe2\x80\x9cexhaust[ing] the [patentee\xe2\x80\x99s] monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d in that item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to use [or] sell\xe2\x80\x9d the thing as he sees fit.  United States v. Univis Lens Co., \n\n316 U.\xc2\xa0S. 241\n\xe2\x80\x93250 (1942).  We have explained the basis for the doctrine as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he purpose of the patent law is fulfilled with respect to any particular article when the patentee has received his reward . . . by the sale of the article\xe2\x80\x9d; once that \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose is realized the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 251.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with that rationale, the doctrine restricts a patentee\xe2\x80\x99s rights only as to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular article\xe2\x80\x9d sold, ibid.; it leaves untouched the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prevent a buyer from making new copies of the patented item.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he purchaser of the [patented] machine . . . does not acquire any right to construct another machine either for his own use or to be vended to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mitchell v. Hawley, 16 Wall. 544, 548 (1873); see Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther, \n\n377 U.\xc2\xa0S. 422, \n424 (1964)\n (holding that a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d of a patented machine \xe2\x80\x9cwould impinge on the patentee\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x98to exclude others from making\xe2\x80\x99 . . . the article\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7154 (1964 ed.))).  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9ca second creation\xe2\x80\x9d of the patented item \xe2\x80\x9ccall[s] the monopoly, conferred by the patent grant, into play for a second time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., \n\n365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 336, \n346 (1961)\n.  That is because the patent holder has \xe2\x80\x9creceived his reward\xe2\x80\x9d only for the actual article sold, and not for subsequent recreations of it.  Univis, 316 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251.  If the purchaser of that article could make and sell endless copies, the patent would effectively protect the invention for just a single sale.  Bowman himself disputes none of this analysis as a general matter: He forthrightly acknowledges the \xe2\x80\x9cwell settled\xe2\x80\x9d principle \xe2\x80\x9cthat the exhaustion doctrine does not extend to the right to \xe2\x80\x98make\xe2\x80\x99 a new product.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 37 (citing Aro, 365 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 346).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnfortunately for Bowman, that principle decides this case against him.  Under the patent exhaustion doctrine, Bowman could resell the patented soybeans he purchased from the grain elevator; so too he could consume the beans himself or feed them to his animals.  Monsanto, although the patent holder, would have no business interfering in those uses of Roundup Ready beans.  But the exhaustion doctrine does not enable Bowman to make additional patented soybeans without Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s permission (either express or implied).  And that is precisely what Bowman did.  He took the soybeans he purchased home; planted them in his fields at the time he thought best; applied glyphosate to kill weeds (as well as any soy plants lacking the Roundup Ready trait); and finally harvested more (many more) beans than he started with.  That is how \xe2\x80\x9cto \xe2\x80\x98make\xe2\x80\x99 a new product,\xe2\x80\x9d to use Bowman\xe2\x80\x99s words, when the original product is a seed.  Brief for Petitioner 37; see Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1363 (1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9ccause to exist, occur, or appear,\xe2\x80\x9d or more specifically, \xe2\x80\x9cplant and raise (a crop)\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because Bowman thus reproduced Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented invention, the exhaustion doctrine does not protect him.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWere the matter otherwise, Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patent would provide scant benefit.  After inventing the Roundup Ready trait, Monsanto would, to be sure, \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[e] [its] reward\xe2\x80\x9d for the first seeds it sells.  Univis, 316 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 251.  But in short order, other seed companies could reproduce the product and market it to growers, thus depriving Mon-santo of its monopoly.  And farmers themselves need only buy the seed once, whether from Monsanto, a competitor, or (as here) a grain elevator.  The grower could multiply his initial purchase, and then multiply that new creation, ad infinitum\xe2\x80\x94each time profiting from the patented seed without compensating its inventor.  Bowman\xe2\x80\x99s late-season plantings offer a prime illustration.  After buying beans for a single harvest, Bowman saved enough seed each year to reduce or eliminate the need for additional purchases.  Monsanto still held its patent, but received no gain from Bowman\xe2\x80\x99s annual production and sale of Roundup Ready soybeans.  The exhaustion doctrine is limited to the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular item\xe2\x80\x9d sold to avoid just such a mismatch between invention and reward.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur holding today also follows from J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124 (2001)\n.  We considered there whether an inventor could get a patent on a seed or plant, or only a certificate issued under the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72321 et\xc2\xa0seq.  We decided a patent was available, rejecting the claim that the PVPA implicitly repealed the Patent Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of seeds and plants.  On our view, the two statutes established different, but not conflicting schemes: The requirements for getting a patent \xe2\x80\x9care more stringent than those for obtaining a PVP certificate, and the pro-tections afforded\xe2\x80\x9d by a patent are correspondingly greater.  J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M., 534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 142.  Most notable here, we explained that only a patent holder (not a certificate holder) could prohibit \xe2\x80\x9c[a] farmer who legally purchases and plants\xe2\x80\x9d a protected seed from saving harvested seed \xe2\x80\x9cfor replanting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 140; see id., at 143 (noting that the Patent Act, unlike the PVPA, contains \xe2\x80\x9cno exemptio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9csaving seed\xe2\x80\x9d).  That statement is inconsistent with applying exhaustion to protect conduct like Bowman\xe2\x80\x99s.  If a sale cut off the right to control a patented seed\xe2\x80\x99s progeny, then (contrary to J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M.) the patentee could not prevent the buyer from saving harvested seed.  Indeed, the patentee could not stop the buyer from selling such seed, which even a PVP certificate owner (who, recall, is supposed to have fewer rights) can usually accomplish.  See 7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72541, 2543.  Those limitations would turn upside-down the statutory scheme J.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0M. described.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBowman principally argues that exhaustion should apply here because seeds are meant to be planted.  The exhaustion doctrine, he reminds us, typically prevents a patentee from controlling the use of a patented product following an authorized sale.  And in planting Roundup Ready seeds, Bowman continues, he is merely using them in the normal way farmers do.  Bowman thus concludes that allowing Monsanto to interfere with that use would \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] an impermissible exception to the exhaustion doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d for patented seeds and other \xe2\x80\x9cself-replicating technologies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 16.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut it is really Bowman who is asking for an unprecedented exception\xe2\x80\x94to what he concedes is the \xe2\x80\x9cwell settled\xe2\x80\x9d rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exhaustion doctrine does not extend to the right to \xe2\x80\x98make\xe2\x80\x99 a new product.\xe2\x80\x9d  See supra, at 5.  Reproducing a patented article no doubt \xe2\x80\x9cuses\xe2\x80\x9d it after a fashion.  But as already explained, we have always drawn the boundaries of the exhaustion doctrine to exclude that activity, so that the patentee retains an undiminished right to prohibit others from making the thing his patent protects.  See, e.g., Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons, \n\n106 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89\n\xe2\x80\x9394 (1882) (holding that a purchaser could not \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d the buckle from a patented cotton-bale tie to \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d a new tie).  That is because, once again, if simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention.  The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years (as the Patent Act promises), but for only one transaction.  And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted.  Hence our repeated insistence that exhaustion applies only to the particular item sold, and not to reproductions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor do we think that rule will prevent farmers from making appropriate use of the Roundup Ready seed they buy.  Bowman himself stands in a peculiarly poor position to assert such a claim.  As noted earlier, the commodity soybeans he purchased were intended not for planting, but for consumption. See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  Indeed, Bowman conceded in deposition testimony that he knew of no other farmer who employed beans bought from a grain elevator to grow a new crop.  See App. 84a.  So a non-replicating use of the commodity beans at issue here was not just available, but standard fare.  And in the more ordinary case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed qua seed\xe2\x80\x94that is, seed intended to grow a crop\xe2\x80\x94he will be able to plant it. Monsanto, to be sure, conditions the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reproduce Roundup Ready; but it does not\xe2\x80\x94could not realistically\xe2\x80\x94preclude all planting.  No sane farmer, after all, would buy the product without some ability to grow soybeans from it.  And so Monsanto, predictably enough, sells Roundup Ready seed to farmers with a license to use it to make a crop.  See supra, at 2, 6, n. 3.  Applying our usual rule in this context therefore will allow farmers to benefit from Roundup Ready, even as it rewards Monsanto for its innovation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill, Bowman has another seeds-are-special argument: that soybeans naturally \xe2\x80\x9cself-replicate or \xe2\x80\x98sprout\xe2\x80\x99 unless stored in a controlled manner,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9cit was the planted soybean, not Bowman\xe2\x80\x9d himself, that made replicas of Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented invention.  Brief for Petitioner 42; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]armers, when they plant seeds, they don\xe2\x80\x99t exercise any control . . . over their crop\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cover the creative process\xe2\x80\x9d).  But we think that blame-the-bean defense tough to credit.  Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans\xe2\x80\x99 multiplication; or put another way, the seeds he purchased (miraculous though they might be in other respects) did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops.  As we have explained, supra at 2\xe2\x80\x933, Bowman devised and executed a novel way to harvest crops from Roundup Ready seeds without paying the usual premium.  He purchased beans from a grain elevator anticipating that many would be Roundup Ready; applied a glyphosate-based herbicide in a way that culled any plants without the patented trait; and saved beans from the rest for the next season.  He then planted those Roundup Ready beans at a chosen time; tended and treated them, including by exploiting their patented glyphosate-resistance; and harvested many more seeds, which he either marketed or saved to begin the next cycle.  In all this, the bean surely figured.  But it was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented invention.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur holding today is limited\xe2\x80\x94addressing the situa- tion before us, rather than every one involving a self-replicating product.  We recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse.  In another case, the article\xe2\x80\x99s self-replication might occur outside the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s control.  Or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another purpose.  Cf. \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7117(a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not [a copyright] infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make . . . another copy or adaptation of that computer program provide[d] that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program\xe2\x80\x9d).  We need not address here whether or how the doctrine of patent exhaustion would apply in such circumstances.  In the case at hand, Bowman planted Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them, thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article.  Patent exhaustion provides no haven for that conduct.  We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Grain elevators, as indicated above, purchase grain from farmers and sell it for consumption; under federal and state law, they generally cannot package or market their grain for use as agricultural seed.

The difference between the two purchases was that the first\xe2\x80\x94but not the second\xe2\x80\x94came with a license from Monsanto to plant the seed and then harvest and market one crop of beans.  We do not here confront a case in which Monsanto (or an affiliated seed company) sold Roundup Ready to a farmer without an express license agreement.  For reasons we explain below, we think that case unlikely to arise.  See infra, at 9.  And in the event it did, the farmer might reasonably claim that the sale came with an implied license to plant and harvest one soybean crop.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
