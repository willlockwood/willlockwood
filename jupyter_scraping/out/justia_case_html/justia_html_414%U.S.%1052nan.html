NEPA embodies the belated national recognition that we have been \'brought to the brink\' by myopic pursuit of technological progress and by a decision-making mechanism resting largely on the advice of vested interest groups. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] A long standing policy of listening only to those with enough money to be heard has left our country scarred with a continuum of environmental abcesses. The oil-auto-concrete interests have long urged the necessity of pavng over the countryside with highways. The same oil interests which argued the advisability of off- shore drilling at Santa Barbara pressed for a transAlaska pipeline and obtained a concession in the Act that in effect exempted the pipeline from NEPA to the extent that it curtailed judicial review. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] Other inter- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1055">Page 414 U.S. 1052 , 1055</a></p><p> ests, notably those waiting for the great killing in nuclear fission, got temporary relief from NEPA. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] Our congested land and fouled air bear grim testimony to the success of Detroit in making fortunes out of the destruction of elemental parts of our biosphere. </p><p> We have listened as the manufacturing-industrial complex advised us on the desirability of fueling \'progress\' by stripping our land and using our rivers, lakes, and atmosphere as technological sewers. We have allowed commercial recreational interests to determine the advisability of \'developing\' our dwindling wilderness. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] NEPA was designed to correct in part the infor- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1056">Page 414 U.S. 1052 , 1056</a></p><p> mation void underlying our national decision-making mechanism. Congress knew what happens when we heed the counsel only of those who measure national advancement by GNP and the Dow Jones industrial average. Congress knew that we can trust them to supply us with voluminous economic data, but it also knew that we cannot trust them to supply us with an improved quality of life. They are not advocates of the interests of mountains, forests, streams, rivers, oceans, and coral beds, or of the wildlife that inhabit them or the people who enjoy them. They are not useful when it comes to appraising the values of an unspoiled meadow or glacier or reef, for they think only in terms of dollars. They lack the sensitivity to be entrusted with evaluating what effect dredging will have on our estuaries. These estuaries are essential in part of the life cycle of two-thirds of the marine life. Dredging makes these estuaries biological deserts for years to come. Congress knew that the final say on these environmental matters should not be under the direct or indirect control of those who plan to make millions out of their destruction. </p><p> The people have long heard and too long heeded the advice of those with a monetary stake. NEPA was designed to augment that information with an analysis of other factors. Whether that analysis can be undertaken by those whose economic voice is already heard is an issue as yet undecided in this Court. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] It is an issue worthy of our determination and should be decided before the ongoing construction of the Reef Runway does irreparable injury to the environmental interests here </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1057">Page 414 U.S. 1052 , 1057</a></p><p> involved. These are the considerations that led me to grant the stay.
