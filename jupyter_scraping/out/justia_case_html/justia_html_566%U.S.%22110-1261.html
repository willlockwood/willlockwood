She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with \xc2\xa716(a)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests.  That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s 2-year time period.  The District Court dismissed the complaints as untimely.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Citing its decision in Whittaker v. Whittaker Corp., 639 F.\xc2\xa02d 516, it held that the limitations period is tolled until an insider files the \xc2\xa716(a) disclosure statement \xe2\x80\x9cregardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a question on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in determining that it is tolled until a \xc2\xa716(a) statement is filed.

The rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment.  Under long-settled equitable-tolling principles, a litigant must establish \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pace v. DiGuglielmo, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408\n.  Tolling therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should have been, discovered by the plaintiff.  Allowing tolling to continue beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the general purpose of statutes of limitations: \xe2\x80\x9cto protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130\n.  The Whittaker rule\xe2\x80\x99s inequity is especially apparent here, where the theory of \xc2\xa716(b) liability is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they had to file a \xc2\xa716(a) statement.  Under the Whittaker rule, alleged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled either to file or to face the prospect of \xc2\xa716(b) litigation in perpetuity.  Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it would have said so.  Simmonds\xe2\x80\x99 arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.

Pointing to dictum in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350 (1991)\n, petitioners argue that \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is a period of repose, which is not to be \xe2\x80\x9cextended to account for a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the facts underlying a claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 17.  See Lampf, supra, at 360, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 16(b) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sets a 2-year .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. period of repose\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do not reach that contention, because we conclude that, even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in de-termining that it is tolled until the filing of a \xc2\xa716(a) statement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn adopting its rule in Whittaker, the Ninth Circuit ex-pressed its concern that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t would be a simple matter for the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section 16(b) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. simply by failing to file .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reports in violation of subdivision (a) and thereby concealing from prospective plaintiffs the information they would need\xe2\x80\x9d to bring a \xc2\xa716(b) action.  639 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 528 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Assuming that is correct, it does not follow that the limitations period is tolled until the \xc2\xa716(a) statement is filed.  Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the period in that manner.  The 2-year clock starts from \xe2\x80\x9cthe date such profit was realized.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778p(b).  Congress could have very easily provided that \xe2\x80\x9cno such suit shall be brought more than two years after the filing of a statement under subsection (a)(2)(C).\xe2\x80\x9d  But it did not.  The text of \xc2\xa716 simply does not support the Whittaker rule.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Whittaker court suggested that the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t operates to toll the limitations period until the \xc2\xa716(a) statement is filed.  See 639 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 527, and n.\xc2\xa09.  Even accepting that equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered by the failure to file a \xc2\xa716(a) statement, the Whittaker rule is completely divorced from long-settled equitable-tolling principles.  \xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pace v. DiGuglielmo, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408, \n418 (2005)\n (emphasis added).  It is well established, moreover, that when a limitations period is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts, the tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have been, discovered by the plaintiff.  2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \xc2\xa79.7.1, pp. 55\xe2\x80\x9357 (1991).  Thus, we have explained that the statute does not begin to run until discovery of the fraud \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98where the party injured by the fraud remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Lampf, supra, at 363 (quoting Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875); emphasis added).  Allowing tolling to continue beyond the point at which a \xc2\xa716(b) plaintiff is aware, or should have been aware, of the facts underlying the claim would quite certainly be inequitable and inconsistent with the general purpose of statutes of limitations: \xe2\x80\x9cto protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, \n\n552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 130, \n133 (2008)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe inequity of the Whittaker rule is especially apparent in a case such as this, where the theory of \xc2\xa716(b) liability of underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they were required to file a \xc2\xa716(a) statement.  And where they disclaim the necessity of filing, the Whittaker rule compels them either to file or to face the prospect of \xc2\xa716(b) litigation in perpetuity.  Simmonds has acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cunder her theory she could buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago and bring claims for short-swing transactions if the underwriters had undervalued a stock.\xe2\x80\x9d  602 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1218.  The potential for such endless tolling in cases in which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the facts underlying the action is out of step with the purpose of limitations periods in general.  And it is especially at odds with a provision that imposes strict liability on putative insiders, see Gollust, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122.  Had Congress intended this result, it most certainly would have said so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimmonds maintains that failing to apply the Whittaker rule would obstruct Congress\xe2\x80\x99s objective of curbing short-swing speculation by corporate insiders.  This objective, according to Simmonds, is served by \xc2\xa716(a) statements, which \xe2\x80\x9cprovide the information necessary to trigger \xc2\xa716(b) enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 24.  Simmonds\xe2\x80\x94like the Ninth Circuit in Whittaker\xe2\x80\x94disregards the most glaring indication that Congress did not intend that the limitations period be categorically tolled until the statement is filed: The limitations provision does not say so.  This fact alone is reason enough to reject a departure from settled equitable-tolling principles.  Moreover, \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is fully served by the rules outlined above, under which the limitations period would not expire until two years after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have learned the facts underlying a \xc2\xa716(b) action.  The usual equitable-tolling inquiry will thus take account of the unavailability of sources of information other than the \xc2\xa716(a) filing.  Cf., e.g., Ruth v. Unifund CCR Partners, 604 F.\xc2\xa03d 908, 911\xe2\x80\x93913 (CA6 2010); Santos ex rel. Beato v. United States, 559 F.\xc2\xa03d 189, 202\xe2\x80\x93203 (CA3 2009).  The oddity of Simmonds\xe2\x80\x99 position is well demonstrated by the circumstances of this case.  Under the Whittaker rule, because petitioners have yet to file \xc2\xa716(a) statements (as noted earlier they do not think themselves subject to that requirement), Simmonds still has two years to bring suit, even though she is so well aware of her alleged cause of action that she has already sued.  If \xc2\xa716(a) statements were, as Simmonds suggests, indispensable to a party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sue, Simmonds would not be here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimmonds also asserts that application of established equitable-tolling doctrine in this context would be in-consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intention to establish in \xc2\xa716 a clear rule that is capable of \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 57 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Equitable tolling, after all, involves fact-intensive disputes \xe2\x80\x9cabout what the notice was, where it was disseminated, who received it, when it was received, and whether it provides sufficient notice of relevant Section 16(a) facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id, at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  Of course this argument counsels just as much in favor of the \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d rule that petitioners urge (that is, no tolling whatever) as it does in favor of the Whittaker rule.  No tolling is certainly an easily administrable bright-line rule.

Co. v. Utah,\n, Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule isbest understood as applying legal\xe2\x80\x94rather than equitable\xe2\x80\x94tolling.  In American Pipe, we held that \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 554.  We based our conclusion on \xe2\x80\x9cthe efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 class actions].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 553.  Although we did not employ the term \xe2\x80\x9clegal tolling,\xe2\x80\x9d some federal courts have used that term to describe our holding on the ground that the rule \xe2\x80\x9cis derived from a statutory source,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas equitable tolling is \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially created.\xe2\x80\x9d  Arivella v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 623 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 164, 176 (Mass. 2009).  The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter.  As we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles nor the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory source\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa716 supports the conclusion that the limitations period is tolled until the filing of a \xc2\xa716(a) statement.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0It is for this reason that we also reject the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule that the 2-year period is tolled until the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cgets actual notice that a person subject to Section 16(a) has realized specific short-swing profits that are worth pursuing,\xe2\x80\x9d Litzler v.
