S. 97</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a writ of error to a decree pronounced in the court of the last resort in the State of Mississippi directing the plaintiffs in error to convey to the defendants a certain tract of land in the said proceedings mentioned.  The plaintiffs in error allege that their title was secured by the compact entered into between the United States and Georgia for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="98">Page 26 U. S. 98</a></p><p> cession of the country in which the land lies, and that this decree is in violation of that compact.  The defendants insist that the compact between the United States and Georgia was not called into question, and that the 25th section of the Judicial Act does not give this Court jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p>In the construction of that section, the Court has never required that the treaty or act of Congress under which the party claims who brings the final judgment of a state court into review before this Court should have been pleaded specially or spread on the record.  But it has always been deemed essential to the exercise of jurisdiction in such a case that the record should show a complete title under the treaty or act of Congress and that the judgment of the court is in violation of that treaty or act.  The condition in the Cession Act, on which the plaintiffs in error rely, is in these words:</p>\n<p>"That all persons who on 27 October, 1795, were actual settlers within the territory thus ceded shall be confirmed in all the grants legally and fully executed prior to that day by the former British government of West Florida or by the government of Spain."</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs produce a grant, legally and fully executed, but to bring the case under the treaty they must also prove that the ancestor or person under whom they claim was an actual settler on 27 October, 1795.  The answer asserts that the warrant of survey issued on 7 February, 1793, and the survey made on 20 July in the same year, when possession was taken, and that the patent issued on 3 April, 1794.  James Williams deposes that about 3 December, 1795, he took possession of the tract of land in dispute as overseer for James Mather, the patentee, and understood from him that he had gone to Natchez sometime before to apply for land in the part of the country where the tract in controversy lies.  This is the testimony furnished by the record to prove that James Mather, the grantee, was an actual settler according to the requisition of the Cession Act of Georgia.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/25/530/case.html">Henderson v. Poindexter,</a></span></em> 12 Wheat. 530, the term "actual settler" seems to have been understood as synonymous with the resident of the country.  That case, however, did not require that the precise meaning of the term should be fixed, and the Court is disposed to think that a settlement made on the land by another person who cultivated it for the proprietor would be sufficient though the proprietor should not reside in person on the estate or within the territory.  Had the settlement proved by Williams been made at the day required by the Cession Act, it would, we think, have satisfied the requisition of that act and entitled the plaintiffs in error to the benefit of the condition.  But it was not made until 3 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="99">Page 26 U. S. 99</a></p><p> December, 1795.  We think then that the plaintiffs in error have failed to prove that the person under whom they claim was an actual settler on 27 October, 1795, and that the Court has no jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p><em>The writ of error dismissed, it not appearing that this Court has jurisdiction of the cause.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
