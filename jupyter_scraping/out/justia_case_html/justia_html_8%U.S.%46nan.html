In the plea it was stated that he was an alien and subject of France.  An objection to the jurisdiction was taken, the record not showing that a suit upon the notes could be prosecuted in the Circuit Court of Georgia.</p>\n<p>It was suggested by the counsel for the defendant that it did not sufficiently appear that the original parties to the notes were aliens.</p>\n<p>But MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL said that if it did not appear upon the record that the character of the original parties would support the jurisdiction, that objection was equally fatal under the uniform decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p>As to costs, the Court directed that in cases of reversal, costs do not go of course, but in all cases of affirmance they do, and that when a judgment is reversed for want of jurisdiction, it must be without costs.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
