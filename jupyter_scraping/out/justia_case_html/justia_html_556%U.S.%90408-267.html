S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  With counsel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, respondent agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges.  The special court-martial accepted the plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was discharged from the Navy in 2000.  In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent based on the conviction.  To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of deportation.  Though rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for lack of merit.  Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further proceedings on the merits.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.

Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>coram nobis </em>request is simply a further \xe2\x80\x9cstep in [his] criminal\xe2\x80\x9d appeal, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/502/index.html">346 U. S. 502</a>, 505 n.\xc2\xa04, the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised under \xc2\xa7866(a) to hear and determine the conviction\xe2\x80\x99s validity on direct review.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>coram nobis </em>request is not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA \xe2\x80\x9cact only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7866(c).  An alleged error in the original judgment predicated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the conviction\xe2\x80\x99s validity, see <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, <em>ante,</em> at ___, so respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment claim is \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to\xe2\x80\x9d the special-court-martial\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfindings\xe2\x80\x9d of guilty.  Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.

The military court which had affirmed the conviction and where the writ of <em>coram nobis </em>was sought is the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA).  Its ruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the writ, but then denying its issuance for lack of merit, was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF).  After the CAAF agreed that the NMCCA has jurisdiction to issue the writ, it remanded for further proceedings on the merits.  The Government of the United States, contending that a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>directed to a final judgment of conviction is beyond the jurisdiction of the military courts, now brings the case to us.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Jacob Denedo came to the United States in 1984 from his native Nigeria.  He enlisted in the Navy in 1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990.  In 1998, military authorities charged him with conspiracy, larceny, and forgery\xe2\x80\x94in contravention of Articles 81, 121, and 123 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7881, 921, 923\xe2\x80\x94all for his role in a scheme to defraud a community college.  With the assistance of both military and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea bargain to plead guilty to reduced charges.  In exchange for his plea the convening authority referred respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case to a special court-martial, \xc2\xa7819, which, at that time, could not impose a sentence greater than six months\xe2\x80\x99 confinement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The special court-martial, consisting of a single military judge, accepted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea after determining that it was both knowing and voluntary.  The court convicted respondent of conspiracy and larceny.  It sentenced him to three months\xe2\x80\x99 confinement, a bad-conduct discharge, and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.  Respondent appealed on the ground that his sentence was unduly severe.  The NMCCA affirmed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a\xe2\x80\x9367a.  Respondent did not seek further review in the CAAF, and he was discharged from the Navy on May 30, 2000.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent based upon his special court-martial conviction.  To avoid deportation, respondent decided to challenge his conviction once more, though at this point it had been final for eight years.  He maintained, in a petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> filed with the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier affirmed must be deemed void because his guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Respondent alleged that he informed his civilian attorney during plea negotiations that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98his primary concern and objective\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was to avoid deportation and that he was willing to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98risk \xe2\x80\xa6 going to jail\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to avert separation from his family.  66 M.\xc2\xa0J. 114, 118 (C.\xc2\xa0A. Armed Forces 2008).  On respondent\xe2\x80\x99s account, his attorney\xe2\x80\x94an alcoholic who was not sober during the course of the special court-martial proceeding\xe2\x80\x94erroneously assured him that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98if he agreed to plead guilty at a special-court-martial he would avoid any risk of deportation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Petitioner argued that the NMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issuing a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>under the authority of the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.  It contended that the NMCCA had no authority to conduct postconviction proceedings.  In a terse, four-sentence order, the NMCCA summarily denied both the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em>.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.  Respondent appealed and the CAAF, dividing 3 to 2, affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA that standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review under the All Writs Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 119.  This is so, the CAAF explained, because \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a petitioner seeks collateral relief to modify an action that was taken within the subject matter jurisdiction of the military justice system \xe2\x80\xa6 a writ that is necessary or appropriate may be issued under the All Writs Act \xe2\x80\x98in aid of\xe2\x80\x99 the court\xe2\x80\x99s existing jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 120 (citing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651(a)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Satisfied that it had jurisdiction, the CAAF next turned to whether the writ of <em>coram nobis</em> should issue.  It held that a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was yet to receive a full and fair review \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the military justice system\xe2\x80\x9d could justify issuance of the writ.  66 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 125.  Finding that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim satisfied \xe2\x80\x9cthe threshold criteria for coram nobis review,\xe2\x80\x9d the CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could ascertain in the first instance \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the merits of [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] petition can be resolved on the basis of the written submissions, or whether a factfinding hearing is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 126, 130.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Stucky filed a dissenting opinion.  Assuming that the majority had correctly determined its jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, he concluded that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim lacked merit.  <em>Id.</em>, at 131.  Judge Ryan also dissented.  Reasoning that the majority had misapplied this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Clinton </em>v.<em> Goldsmith, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/526/529/index.html">526 U. S. 529</a> (1999), she concluded that the UCMJ does not confer jurisdiction upon military tribunals to conduct \xe2\x80\x9cpost-finality collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 136.  We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\naffirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before we address another court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction we must first determine our own.  See <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Iqbal</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cSubject-matter jurisdiction \xe2\x80\xa6 should be considered when fairly in doubt\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government, upon which the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdiction lies, <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/332/index.html">547 U. S. 332</a>, 342 (2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests on 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259(4).  That jurisdictional provision permits us to review CAAF decisions in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cases \xe2\x80\xa6 in which the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces \xe2\x80\xa6 granted relief.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Respondent maintains that we lack jurisdiction because the CAAF did not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98grant relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9call it did was remand\xe2\x80\x9d to the NMCCA.  Brief for Respondent 6\xe2\x80\x937 (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s parsimonious construction of the word \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d need not detain us long.  Though \xc2\xa71259 does not define the term, its familiar meaning encompasses any \xe2\x80\x9credress or benefit\xe2\x80\x9d provided by a court.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1317 (8th ed. 2004).  The CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s judgment reversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition.  The NMCCA denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis,</em> while the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decision reversed and remanded so that the NMCCA could determine anew if the writ should issue.  That decision conferred a palpable benefit on respondent; for a chance of success on the merits, however slight, is superior to no possibility at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, respondent would have preferred the CAAF to issue a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> or to direct the NMCCA to do so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct further proceedings.  We have jurisdiction, however, to review any decision granting \xe2\x80\x9crelief,\xe2\x80\x9d not just those providing \xe2\x80\x9cultimate relief\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, appellate courts reverse and remand lower court judgments\xe2\x80\x94rather than issuing complete relief\xe2\x80\x94with regularity.  See, <em>e.g., Arthur Andersen LLP</em> v. <em>Carlisle</em>, <em>ante,</em> at ___; <em>FCC </em>v.<em> Fox Television Stations, Inc.</em>, <em>ante,</em> at ___.  There is no merit to the view that a decision granting partial relief should be construed as granting no relief at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the CAAF \xe2\x80\x9cgranted relief\xe2\x80\x9d to respondent, the text of \xc2\xa71259 is satisfied here.  We have jurisdiction to determine whether the CAAF was correct in ruling that the NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The writ of <em>coram nobis</em> is an ancient common-law remedy designed \xe2\x80\x9cto correct errors of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/502/index.html">346 U. S. 502</a>, 507 (1954).  In American jurisprudence the precise contours of <em>coram nobis</em> have not been \xe2\x80\x9cwell defined,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bronson</em> v. <em>Schulten</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/104/410/index.html">104 U. S. 410</a>, 416 (1882), but the writ traces its origins to the King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench and the Court of Common Pleas.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Plumer</em>, 27 F. Cas. 561, 573 (No. 16,056) (CC Mass. 1859) (opinion for the court by Clifford, Circuit Justice); see also <em>Morgan</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 507, n.\xc2\xa09 (citing 2 W. Tidd, Practice of Courts of King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench and Common Pleas *1136\xe2\x80\x93*1137).  In English practice the office of the writ was to foster respect for judicial rulings by enabling the same court \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the action was commenced and where the judgment was rendered\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid the rigid strictures of judgment finality by correcting technical errors \xe2\x80\x9csuch as happened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the proceedings prior to the judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Plumer</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 572\xe2\x80\x93573.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any rationale confining the writ to technical errors, however, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration <em>coram nobis</em> is broader than its common-law predecessor.  This is confirmed by our opinion in <em>Morgan</em>.  In that case we found that a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> can issue to redress a fundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to mere technical errors<em>.</em>  346 U. S., at 513.  The potential universe of cases that range from technical errors to fundamental ones perhaps illustrates, in the case of <em>coram nobis</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9ctendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic.\xe2\x80\x9d  B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 51 (1921).  To confine the use of <em>coram nobis</em> so that finality is not at risk in a great number of cases, we were careful in <em>Morgan </em>to limit the availability of the writ<em> </em>to \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d cases presenting circumstances compelling its use \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  346 U. S., at 511.  Another limit, of course, is that an extraordinary remedy<em> </em>may not issue when alternative remedies, such as habeas corpus, are available.  See <em>id., </em>at 510\xe2\x80\x93511.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits \xe2\x80\x9ccourts established by Act of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d to issue \xe2\x80\x9call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

S. 683</a>, 695, n.\xc2\xa07 (1969), that authority does not determine the anterior question whether military courts have jurisdiction to entertain a petition for <em>coram nobis.</em>  As the text of the All Writs Act recognizes, a court\xe2\x80\x99s power to issue any form of relief\xe2\x80\x94extraordinary or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94is contingent on that court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or controversy.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming no constraints or limitations grounded in the Constitution are implicated, it is for Congress to determine the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts.  <em>Bowles</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/205/index.html">551 U. S. 205</a>, 212 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cWithin constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider\xe2\x80\x9d).  This rule applies with added force to Article I tribunals, such as the NMCCA and CAAF, which owe their existence to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority to enact legislation pursuant to Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78 of the Constitution.  <em>Goldsmith</em>, 526 U. S., at 533\xe2\x80\x93534.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision in <em>Goldsmith </em>demonstrates these teachings.  There an Air Force officer, James Goldsmith, was convicted of various crimes by general court-martial and sentenced to six years\xe2\x80\x99 confinement.  <em>Id., </em>at 531.  Following his conviction, Congress enacted a statute authorizing the President to drop convicted officers from the rolls of the Armed Forces.  When the Air Force notified Goldsmith that he would be dropped from the rolls, he lodged a petition before the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) claiming that the proposed action contravened the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto</em> Clause of the Constitution.  <em>Id., </em>at 532\xe2\x80\x93533<em>.</em>  Goldsmith sought extraordinary relief as authorized by the All Writs Act to enjoin the President from removing him from the rolls.  The AFCCA denied relief, but the CAAF granted it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concluding that the UCMJ does not authorize military courts to review executive action\xe2\x80\x94including a decision to drop an officer from the rolls\xe2\x80\x94we held that the AFCCA and the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <em>Id., </em>at 535.  This was so, we unequivocally found, irrespective of the military court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to issue extraordinary relief pursuant to the All Writs Act and its previous jurisdiction over Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s criminal proceeding.  The power to issue relief depends upon, rather than enlarges, a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 536\xe2\x80\x93537.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That principle does not control the question before us.  Because <em>coram nobis </em>is but an extraordinary tool to correct a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is properly viewed as a belated extension of the original proceeding during which the error allegedly transpired.  See <em>Morgan, supra, </em>at 505, n.\xc2\xa04 (<em>coram nobis </em>is \xe2\x80\x9ca step in the criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Beggerly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/38/index.html">524 U. S. 38</a>, 46 (1998) (citing <em>Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co. of Mo. </em>v.<em> Missouri Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/111/505/index.html">111 U. S. 505</a>, 522 (1884) (noting that an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, like <em>coram nobis</em>, is an equitable means to obtain relief from a judgment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may be regarded as ancillary to the prior suit, so that the relief asked may be granted by the court which made the decree in that suit \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The bill, though an original bill in the chancery sense of the word, is a continuation of the former suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of the [court]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  It follows that to issue respondent a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> on remand, the NMCCA must have had statutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent\xe2\x80\x99s original judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdiction and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of <em>coram nobis</em> in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for review as one \xe2\x80\x9cunder the All Writs Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  66 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 119.  This is correct, of course, if it simply confirms that the Act authorizes federal courts to issue writs \xe2\x80\x9cin aid of\xe2\x80\x9d their jurisdiction; but it does not advance the inquiry into whether jurisdiction exists.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there are limits to the use of <em>coram nobis </em>to alter or interpret earlier judgments.  As <em>Goldsmith </em>makes plain, the All Writs Act and the extraordinary relief the statute authorizes are not a source of subject-matter jurisdiction.  526 U. S., at 534\xe2\x80\x93535.  Statutes which address the power of a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree certain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in some specified measure, in some circumstances might be construed also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and determine the underlying cause of action.  Cf.<em> Marbury </em>v.<em> Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  We have long held, however, that the All Writs Act should not be interpreted in this way.  <em>Goldsmith, supra, </em>at 536; <em>Plumer</em>, 27 F.\xc2\xa0Cas., at 574 (jurisdiction cannot be acquired \xe2\x80\x9cby means of the writ to be issued\xe2\x80\x9d).  The authority to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font of jurisdiction.  See <em>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.</em> v. <em>Henson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/28/index.html">537 U. S. 28</a>, 31 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite apart from the All Writs Act, we conclude that the NMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em>.  Article 66 of the UCMJ provides: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases, the [Court of Criminal Appeals] may sit \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7866(a).  Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for <em>coram nobis </em>is simply a further \xe2\x80\x9cstep in [his] criminal\xe2\x80\x9d appeal, <em>Morgan</em>, 346 U. S., at 505, n.\xc2\xa04, the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to hear and determine the validity of the conviction on direct review.  As even the Government concedes, the textual authority under the UCMJ to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98revie[w] court-martial cases\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d provided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an appeal of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of conviction.  See Brief for United States 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  That jurisdiction is sufficient to permit the NMCCA to entertain respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for <em>coram nobis</em>.  See also Courts of Criminal Appeals Rule of Practice and Procedure 2(b) (recognizing NMCCA discretionary authority to entertain petitions for extraordinary writs).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that when exercising its jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7866(a), the NMCCA \xe2\x80\x9cmay act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7866(c).  That limitation does not bar respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em>.  An alleged error in the original judgment predicated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the validity of a conviction, see <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 3, so respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment claim is \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to\xe2\x80\x9d the special-court-martial\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfindings of guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7866(c).  Pursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA has subject-matter jurisdiction to hear respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the NMCCA had jurisdiction over respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for <em>coram nobis</em>, the CAAF had jurisdiction to entertain respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal from the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  When exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s authority is confined \xe2\x80\x9cto matters of law\xe2\x80\x9d connected to \xe2\x80\x9cthe findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside \xe2\x80\xa6 by the Court of Criminal Appeals,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7867(c), but these limitations pose no obstacle to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s requested review of the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment claim presents a \xe2\x80\x9cmatte[r] of law\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to the [guilty] findings \xe2\x80\xa6 as approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed \xe2\x80\xa6 by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The CAAF had subject-matter jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7876, \xe2\x80\x9caffirmatively prohibit[s] the type of collateral review sought by respondent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 18.  That is incorrect.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument commits the error of \xe2\x80\x9cconflating the jurisdictional question with the merits\xe2\x80\x9d of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition.<em>  Arthur Andersen LLP</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 3.  Article 76 states in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe appellate review of records of trial provided by this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and discharges carried into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required by this chapter, are final and conclusive.  Orders publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7876.</p>\n<p align="left">\nArticle 76 codifies the common-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.  <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/738/index.html">420 U. S. 738</a>, 749 (1975).  Just as the rules of finality did not jurisdictionally bar the court in <em>Morgan </em>from examining its earlier judgment, neither does the principle of finality bar the NMCCA from doing so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government may ultimately be correct that the facts of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case are insufficient to set aside the final judgment that Article 76 makes binding.  No doubt, judgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside; and courts must be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of <em>coram nobis</em> issues only in extreme cases.  But the long-recognized authority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier judgments impels the conclusion that the finality rule<em> </em>is not so inflexible that it trumps each and every competing consideration.  Our holding allows military courts to protect the integrity of their dispositions and processes by granting relief from final judgments in extraordinary cases when it is shown that there were fundamental flaws in the proceedings leading to their issuance.  The Government remains free to argue that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s is a merely ordinary case that is not entitled to extraordinary relief.  But respondent\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to relief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdictional question presented.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>coram nobis</em> permits a court \xe2\x80\x9cto correct its <em>own</em> errors, not \xe2\x80\xa6 those of an inferior court,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of on similar grounds.  Just as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for <em>coram nobis</em> does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the relief should not issue \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the writ\xe2\x80\x99s traditional scope\xe2\x80\x9d does not undermine it, <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis deleted).  In sum, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not the NMCCA\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction to issue it.  The CAAF rejected the former argument.  Only the latter one is before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction to entertain <em>coram nobis</em> petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect.  That conclusion is consistent with our holding that Article III courts have a like authority.  <em>Morgan, </em>346 U. S., at 508.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The result we reach today is of central importance for military courts.  The military justice system relies upon courts that must take all appropriate means, consistent with their statutory jurisdiction, to ensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.  Under the premises and statutes we have relied upon here, the jurisdiction and the responsibility of military courts to reexamine judgments in rare cases where a fundamental flaw is alleged and other judicial processes for correction are unavailable are consistent with the powers Congress has granted those courts under Article I and with the system Congress has designed.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not prejudge the merits of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  To be sure, the writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> is an extraordinary writ; and \xe2\x80\x9can extraordinary remedy \xe2\x80\xa6 should not be granted in the ordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The relative strength of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim, his delay in lodging his petition, when he learned or should have learned of his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s alleged deficiencies, and the effect of the rule of judgment finality expressed in Article 76 are all factors the NMCCA can explore on remand.  We hold only that the military appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for a writ of <em>coram nobis</em>.  The judgment of the CAAF is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962970">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF ROBERTS, C.

The military courts here had original jurisdiction over Denedo\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Those courts therefore have implicit \xe2\x80\x9cextended\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction to consider Denedo\xe2\x80\x99s <em>coram nobis</em> petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaw in this syllogism is at the first step: The only arguable authority for the proposition that <em>coram nobis</em> jurisdiction marches hand in hand with original jurisdiction is a footnote in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/502/index.html">346 U. S. 502</a> (1954), and that case concerned Article III courts.  The military courts are markedly different.  They are Article I courts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn.  Those careful limits cannot be overridden by judicial \xe2\x80\x9cextension\xe2\x80\x9d of statutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a \xe2\x80\x9cfurther step\xe2\x80\x9d to the ones marked out by Congress.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the majority that this Court has jurisdiction to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent from its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to issue writs of <em>coram nobis</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTraditionally, military justice has been a rough form of justice emphasizing summary procedures, speedy convictions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining obedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/1/index.html">354 U.

If a service member wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he pursued a collateral attack in an Article III court.

But in keeping with the historical backdrop against which these courts were created, Congress did not grant military courts of appeals \xe2\x80\x9cbroad responsibility with respect to administration of military justice\xe2\x80\x9d; on the contrary, their jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly circumscribed\xe2\x80\x9d by the governing statutes.  <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Goldsmith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/529/index.html">526 U.

The UCMJ grants military courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final court-martial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a postconviction extraordinary writ to \xe2\x80\x9caid.\xe2\x80\x9d  A petition for <em>coram nobis</em> by its nature seeks postconviction review; it is therefore beyond the scope of these courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly circumscribed\xe2\x80\x9d statutory jurisdiction.  <em>Goldsmith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 535. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority overrides these careful limits on military court jurisdiction by maintaining that later jurisdiction to issue <em>coram nobis</em> is a \xe2\x80\x9cbelated extension\xe2\x80\x9d of the statutory jurisdiction, that \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction to issue [<em>coram nobis</em>] derives from the earlier jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, 9.  The authority the Court cites for this key jurisdictional analysis is\xe2\x80\x94a footnote.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (citing <em>Morgan</em>, 346 U. S., at 505, n.\xc2\xa04); <em>ante</em>, at 9 (same).  Now, footnotes are part of an opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for a key jurisdictional ruling.  But since footnote 4 plays such an indispensable role in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, it must be read with care.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first thing you notice in doing so is that the footnote does not mention the word \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d at all.  That is because it has nothing to do with jurisdiction.  The issue addressed in the paragraph to which the footnote was appended was \xe2\x80\x9cchoice of remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  346 U. S., at 505.  The Court concluded that <em>coram nobis</em> was the appropriate one.  The footnote simply addressed the concern that the remedy might not be available because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure had abolished <em>coram nobis</em> as a remedy; the concern was dismissed because the Court concluded the criminal rules, not the civil rules, applied.  <em>Id.</em>, at 505, n.\xc2\xa04; see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Keogh</em>, 391 F.\xc2\xa02d 138, 140 (CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem to which the footnote was addressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had abolished writs of error <em>coram nobis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point is further confirmed by the text in the body of the opinion: The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in the paragraph in which the footnote appears is that since the remedy sought was \xe2\x80\x9cin the nature of \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>coram nobis</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the trial court could \xe2\x80\x9cproperly <em>exercise</em> its jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  346 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).  The issue was not the existence of jurisdiction, but whether the court had the authority to exercise it.  The Court in the present case recognizes the distinction.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s authority is confined to matters of law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>ante</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe authority to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even accepting the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <em>Morgan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s hitherto obscure footnote, that reading would only establish the \xe2\x80\x9cbelated jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d theory for Article III courts.  The military courts are Article I courts.  The distinction has direct pertinence to the point at issue in this case.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legal doctrines \xe2\x80\x9cmust be placed in their historical setting.  They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without suffering mutilation or distortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reid</em>, 354 U. S., at 50 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).  The Article III courts have been given broad jurisdiction.  I can understand, if not necessarily agree with, the notion that they might enjoy some implicit \xe2\x80\x9clong-recognized authority\xe2\x80\x9d to correct their earlier judgments.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11.  But not so for Article I courts.  The principle that Congress defines the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts \xe2\x80\x9capplies with added force to Article I tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  That is especially true with respect to military courts.  The military justice system is the last place courts should go about finding \xe2\x80\x9cextensions\xe2\x80\x9d of jurisdiction beyond that conferred by statute.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we expressly recognized in <em>Goldsmith</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no source of <em>continuing</em> jurisdiction for the CAAF over all actions administering sentences that the CAAF <em>at one time</em> had the power to review.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U. S., at 536 (emphasis added).  Since the UCMJ grants military courts no postconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual authority to entertain <em>coram nobis</em> petitions plainly contravenes that basic principle.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of <em>Morgan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote could be transplanted to the military context, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion would still not follow.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute.  Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carlisle</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/416/index.html">517 U.

S. 34</a>, 43 (1985)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The UCMJ contains not one, but two provisions specifically limiting the circumstances under which postconviction relief (other than action by the appropriate Secretary or the President) may be obtained within the court-martial system.  First, Article 73 provides that, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin two years after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7873.  The only relief available under this \xe2\x80\x9cspecial post-conviction remedy\xe2\x80\x9d is a new trial, <em>Burns</em>, 346 U. S., at 141 (plurality opinion), and even that may be granted only in an expressly circumscribed timeframe (two years) and set of circumstances (newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court).  Article 73 stands in stark contrast to <em>coram nobis</em>, which the majority characterizes as a writ infinitely available \xe2\x80\x9cto redress a[ny] fundamental error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6; see <em>Morgan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 512 (\xe2\x80\x9cfundamental error\xe2\x80\x9d not limited to jurisdictional defects or errors on the face of the record).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the limited nature of relief available under Article 73 might lead one to question whether that is truly the <em>only </em>postconviction relief the UCMJ permits.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in the Army now\xe2\x80\x9d is a sufficient answer to such concerns; the relief available looks positively extravagant in light of the prior history and tradition of military justice.  In any event, as the majority recognizes, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, Article 76 makes clear that all court-martial judgments \xe2\x80\x9ccarried into execution\xe2\x80\x9d after completion of direct review are \xe2\x80\x9cfinal and conclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7876.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, that language does not simply \xe2\x80\x9ccodif[y] the common-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  In fact, Article 76 does not stop there.  It goes on to instruct that final court-martial judgments are binding \xe2\x80\x9c<em>subject only</em> to action upon a petition for a new trial [under Article 73],\xe2\x80\x9d or action by the appropriate Secretary or the President.  10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7876 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these provisions, only Article 73 provides <em>any</em> authority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even that narrow authority is limited to pending cases.  Once a conviction is final, only the judge advocate general can provide relief.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3; 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7873.  To the extent the CCAs or the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent continuing authority to issue writs of <em>coram nobis</em>, Articles 73 and 76 extinguish it.  </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government goes on to argue that even if military courts have jurisdiction to issue writs of <em>coram nobis</em>, and even if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar such relief, the courts still lack authority to issue <em>coram nobis</em>, because the writ is neither \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d to the court-martial system of justice.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651(a) (federal courts \xe2\x80\x9cmay issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Coram nobis</em> allows the court that issued a judgment to correct its own errors of fact.  See <em>Morgan</em>, 346 U. S., at 507, n.\xc2\xa09 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If a judgment in the King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench be erroneous in matter of <em>fact</em> only, \xe2\x80\xa6 it may be reversed <em>in the same court</em>, by writ of error <em>coram nobis</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 2 W. Tidd, Practice of the Courts of King\xe2\x80\x99s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856); some emphasis added)); see also <em>ante</em>, at 11 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cauthority of a court to protect the integrity of <em>its </em>earlier judgments\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  But a court-martial is not a standing court.  On a case-by-case basis, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is called into existence for a special purpose and to perform a particular duty.  When the object of its creation has been accomplished it is dissolved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Runkle</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/122/543/index.html">122 U. S. 543</a>, 555\xe2\x80\x93556 (1887); see also 66 M.\xc2\xa0J. 114, 124 (CAAF 2008) (a court-martial \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not have independent jurisdiction over a case after the military judge authenticates the record and the convening authority forwards the record after taking action\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the court-martial that issues the conviction no longer exists once the conviction is final, there is no court to which a postconviction petition for <em>coram nobis</em> could be directed. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of standing courts-martial is no mere technicality, but rather an integral and intentional part of the military justice system.  \xe2\x80\x9cCourt-martial jurisdiction sprang from the belief that within the military ranks there is need for a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience and order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States ex rel.

But meeting that need requires expending significant military resources, and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent that those responsible for performance of [the military\xe2\x80\x99s] primary function are diverted from it by the necessity of trying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not served.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 17.  Accordingly, courts-martial, composed of active duty military personnel, have always been called into existence for a limited purpose and duration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are standing courts that could act as substitutes for <em>coram nobis</em> purposes.  As this case illustrates, those courts are not equipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to resolve claims that might be brought on <em>coram nobis</em>.  Instead, the CCAs will have to resort to the procedures invented by <em>United States</em> v. <em>DuBay</em>, 17 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. 147, 37 C.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening authority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task various military personnel who have no prior familiarity with the case to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hearing on the merits of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 149, 37 C.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0R., at 413.  This \xe2\x80\x9cunwieldy and imperfect system\xe2\x80\x9d will undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconviction relief Congress specifically withheld.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court expressly declines to consider the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary or appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d argument: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not the [CCA\xe2\x80\x99s] jurisdiction to issue it.  The CAAF rejected the former argument.  Only the latter one is before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court may well be correct in dividing the questions into separate pigeonholes.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument, even if an argument about authority rather than jurisdiction, applies to <em>every coram nobis </em>case,<em> </em>given the nature of the military justice system.  It is curious to conclude that military courts have jurisdiction, while not considering a raised and briefed argument that they may never exercise it.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the adoption of the UCMJ, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has gradually changed the system of military justice so that it has come to more closely resemble the civilian system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weiss</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/163/index.html">510 U.
