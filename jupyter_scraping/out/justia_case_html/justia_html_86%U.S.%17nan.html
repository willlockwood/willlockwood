The 9,000 bushels were delivered and paid for before the 1st day of May, and about this there was no dispute.  Some negotiations took place afterwards between Salomon and the quartermaster of that military department concerning the delivery of the remainder, the finding in regard to which was not very clear.  Salomon did, however, deliver the remainder of the corn at Fort Fillmore October 15, 1865, by depositing it in the military storehouse at that place.  The chief quartermaster\'s clerk afterwards examined this corn, weighed some of the sacks, counted the remainder, and gave to Salomon a receipt for the amount, stating that it completed his contract.  This clerk then and there accepted and took actual possession of the corn, and the chief quartermaster gave to Salomon the usual voucher for the sum due.  The corn was sound when delivered, but was injured by reason of the defective and leaky condition of the storehouse at Fort Fillmore.</p>\n<p>The government declining to pay the amount of the voucher, Salomon filed a petition in the court below for payment.  The court decreed that he should be paid for a part of what he had finally delivered and which the government used, but not for the residue, which had proved unserviceable and been lost by decay arising from the defective and leaky condition of the storehouse.
