The plan entitled US Airways to reimbursement if McCutchen later recovered money from the third party.  McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys secured $110,000 in payments, and McCutchen received $66,000 after deducting the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 40% contingency fee.  US Airways demanded reimbursement of the full $66,866 it had paid.  When McCutchen did not comply, US Airways filed suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. appropriate equitable relief .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to enforce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  McCutchen raised two defenses to US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 request for an equitable lien on the $66,866 it demanded: that, absent over-recovery on his part, US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 right to reimbursement did not kick in; and that US Airways had to contribute its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery, so any reimbursement had to be reduced by 40%, to cover the contingency fee.  Rejecting both arguments, the District Court granted summary judgment to US Airways.  The Third Circuit vacated.  Reasoning that traditional \xe2\x80\x9cequitable doctrines and defenses\xe2\x80\x9d applied to \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) suits, it held that the principle of unjust enrichment overrode US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 reimbursement clause because the clause would leave McCutchen with less than full payment for his medical bills and would give US Airways a windfall.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0In a \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) action based on an equitable lien by agreement\xe2\x80\x94like this one\xe2\x80\x94the ERISA plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms govern.

Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356\n, the Court permitted a health-plan administrator to bring a suit just like this one.  The administrator\xe2\x80\x99s claim to enforce its reimbursement clause, the Court explained, was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to enforce a contract-based lien\xe2\x80\x94called an \xe2\x80\x9cequitable lien \xe2\x80\x98by agreement.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365.  Accordingly, the administrator could use \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) to obtain funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over.  The parties agree that US Airways can do the same here.

As in Sereboff, US Airways is seeking to enforce the modern-day equivalent of an equitable lien by agreement.  Such a lien both arises from and serves to carry out a contract\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 363\xe2\x80\x93364.  Thus, enforcing the lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises and declining to apply rules\xe2\x80\x94even if they would be \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d absent a contract\xe2\x80\x94at odds with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 expressed commitments.  The Court has found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity courts.  McCutchen identifies a slew of cases in which courts applied the equitable doctrines invoked here, but none in which they did so to override a clear contract that provided otherwise.  This result comports with ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s focus on what a plan provides: \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) does not \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize \xe2\x80\x98appropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x99 at large,\xe2\x80\x9d Mertens, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253, but countenances only such relief as will enforce \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d or the statute.

US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and the common-fund doctrine provides the appropriate default rule to fill that gap.

Courts construe ERISA plans, as they do other contracts, by \xe2\x80\x9clooking to the terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d as well as to \xe2\x80\x9cother manifestations of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101\n.  Where the terms of a plan leave gaps, courts must \xe2\x80\x9clook outside the plan\xe2\x80\x99s written language\xe2\x80\x9d to decide the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, and they properly take account of the doctrines that typically or traditionally have governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.

By contrast, the plan says nothing specific about how to pay for the costs of recovery.  Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine provides the best indication of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases make clear that the doctrine would govern here in the absence of a contrary agreement.  See, e.g., Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, \n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472\n.  Because a party would not typically expect or intend a plan saying nothing about attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to abrogate so strong and uniform a background rule, a court should be loath to read the plan in that way.  The common-fund rule\xe2\x80\x99s rationale reinforces this conclusion: Without the rule, the insurer can free ride on the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, and the beneficiary, as in this case, may be made worse off for having pursued a third party.  A contract should not be read to produce these strange results unless it specifically provides as much.

The plan in turn entitled US Airways to reimbursement if McCutchen later recovered money from the third party.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court has held that a health-plan administrator like US Airways may enforce such a reimbursement provision by filing suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) of ERISA, \n\n88Stat.\n891, \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(3).

In particular, we address one equitable doctrine limiting reimbursement to the amount of an insured\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdouble recovery\xe2\x80\x9d and another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to pay a share of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred in securing funds from the third party.  We hold that neither of those equitable rules can override the clear terms of a plan.  But we explain that the latter, usually called the common-fund doctrine, plays a role in interpreting US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 plan because the plan is silent about allocating the costs of recovery.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn January 2007, McCutchen suffered serious injuries when another driver lost control of her car and collided with McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s.  At the time, McCutchen was an employee of US Airways and a participant in its self-funded health plan.  The plan paid $66,866 in medical expenses arising from the accident on McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMcCutchen retained attorneys, in exchange for a 40% contingency fee, to seek recovery of all his accident-related damages, estimated to exceed $1 million.  The attorneys sued the driver responsible for the crash, but settled for only $10,000 because she had limited insurance coverage and the accident had killed or seriously injured three other people.  Counsel also secured a payment from McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s own automobile insurer of $100,000, the maximum amount available under his policy.  McCutchen thus received $110,000\xe2\x80\x94and after deducting $44,000 for the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s fee, $66,000.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn learning of McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, US Airways demanded reimbursement of the $66,866 it had paid in medical expenses.  In support of that claim, US Airways relied on the following statement in its summary plan description:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIf [US Airways] pays benefits for any claim you incur as the result of negligence, willful misconduct, or other actions of a third party, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

That amount represented US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 full claim minus a proportionate share of the promised attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUS Airways then filed this action under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), seeking \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d to enforce the plan\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement provision.  The suit requested an equitable lien on $66,866\xe2\x80\x94the $41,500 in the escrow account and $25,366 more in McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s possession.  McCutchen countered by raising two defenses relevant here.  First, he maintained that US Airways could not receive the relief it sought because he had recovered only a small portion of his total damages; absent over-recovery on his part, US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 right to reimbursement did not kick in.  Second, he contended that US Airways at least had to contribute its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery; any reimbursement therefore had to be marked down by 40%, to cover the promised contingency fee.  The District Court rejected both arguments, granting summary judgment to US Airways on the ground that the plan \xe2\x80\x9cclear[ly] and unambiguous[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d provided for full reimbursement of the medical expenses paid.

The Third Circuit reasoned that in a suit for \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3), a court must apply any \xe2\x80\x9cequitable doctrines and defenses\xe2\x80\x9d that traditionally limited the relief requested.  663 F.\xc2\xa03d 671, 676 (CA3 2011).  And here, the court continued, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the principle of unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d should \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98serve to limit the effectiveness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement provision.  See id., at 677 (quoting 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution \xc2\xa723.18, p. 472\xe2\x80\x93473 (1978)).  Full reimbursement, the Third Circuit thought, would \xe2\x80\x9cleav[e] [McCutchen] with less than full payment\xe2\x80\x9d for his medical bills; at the same time, it would provide a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d to US Airways given its failure to \xe2\x80\x9ccontribute to the cost of obtaining the third-party recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 679.

The \xe2\x80\x9cnature of the recovery\xe2\x80\x9d requested was equitable because Mid Atlantic claimed \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically identifiable funds\xe2\x80\x9d within the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 control\xe2\x80\x94that is, a portion of the settlement they had gotten.  Id., at 362\xe2\x80\x93363 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the \xe2\x80\x9cbasis for [the] claim\xe2\x80\x9d was equitable too, because Mid Atlantic relied on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not yet acquired \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98create[s] a lien\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on that object as soon as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the contractor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. gets a title to the thing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 363\xe2\x80\x93364 (quoting Barnes v. Alexander, \n\n232 U.\xc2\xa0S. 117, \n121 (1914)\n).  Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s claim for reimbursement, we determined, was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to enforce such a contract-based lien\xe2\x80\x94called an \xe2\x80\x9cequitable lien by agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, Mid Atlantic could bring an action under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) seeking the funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over.  And here, as all parties agree, US Airways can do the same thing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question in this case concerns the role that equitable defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a suit.  As earlier noted, the Third Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x9d overrides US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 reimbursement clause if and when they come into conflict.  663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 677.  McCutchen offers a more refined version of that view, alleging that two specific equitable doctrines meant to \xe2\x80\x9cprevent unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x9d defeat the reimbursement provision.  Brief for Respondents i.  First, he contends that in equity, an insurer in US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 position could recoup no more than an insured\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdouble recovery\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the amount the insured has received from a third party to compensate for the same loss the insurance covered.  That rule would limit US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 reimbursement to the share of McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s settlements paying for medical expenses; McCutchen would keep the rest (e.g., damages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering), even though the plan gives US Airways first claim on the whole third-party recovery.  Second, McCutchen claims that in equity the common-fund doctrine would have operated to reduce any award to US Airways.  Under that rule, \xe2\x80\x9ca litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee from the fund as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, \n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472, \n478 (1980)\n.  McCutchen urges that this doctrine, which is designed to prevent freeloading, enables him to pass on a share of his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s fees to US Airways, no matter what the plan provides.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe rejected a similar claim in Sereboff, though without altogether foreclosing McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The Sereboffs argued, among other things, that the lower courts erred in enforcing Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement clause \xe2\x80\x9cwithout imposing various limitations\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9capply to truly equitable relief grounded in principles of subrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 368 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In particular, the Sereboffs contended that a variant of the double-recovery rule, called the make-whole doctrine, trumped the plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  We rebuffed that argument, explaining that the Sereboffs were improperly mixing and matching rules from different equitable boxes.  The Sereboffs asserted a \xe2\x80\x9cparcel of equitable defenses\xe2\x80\x9d available when an out-of-pocket insurer brought a \xe2\x80\x9cfreestanding action for equitable subrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d not founded on a contract, to succeed to an insured\xe2\x80\x99s judgment against a third party.  Ibid.  But Mid Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement claim was \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered equitable,\xe2\x80\x9d we replied, because it sought to enforce a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0lien based on agreement\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not a lien imposed independent of contract by virtue of equitable subrogation.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of that fact, we viewed the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 equitable defenses\xe2\x80\x94which again, closely resemble McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94as \xe2\x80\x9cbeside the point.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And yet, we left a narrow opening for future litigants in the Sereboffs\xe2\x80\x99 position to make a like claim.  In a footnote, we observed that the Sereboffs had forfeited a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct assertion\xe2\x80\x9d that the contract-based relief Mid Atlantic requested, although \xe2\x80\x9cequitable,\xe2\x80\x9d was not \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) because \xe2\x80\x9cit contravened principles like the make-whole doctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 368\xe2\x80\x93369 n. 2.  Enter McCutchen, to make that basic argument.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, however, Sereboff\xe2\x80\x99s logic dooms McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s effort.  US Airways, like Mid Atlantic, is seeking to enforce the modern-day equivalent of an \xe2\x80\x9cequitable lien by agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  And that kind of lien\xe2\x80\x94as its name announces\xe2\x80\x94both arises from and serves to carry out a contract\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.  See id., at 363\xe2\x80\x93364; 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\xe2\x80\x99s Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa71234, p. 695 (5th ed. 1941).  So enforcing the lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises.  See, e.g., Barnes, 232 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121; Walker v. Brown, \n\n165 U.\xc2\xa0S. 654, \n664 (1897)\n.  Conversely, it means declining to apply rules\xe2\x80\x94even if they would be \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d in a contract\xe2\x80\x99s absence\xe2\x80\x94at odds with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 expressed commitments.  McCutchen therefore cannot rely on theories of unjust enrichment to defeat US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 appeal to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s clear terms.  Those principles, as we said in Sereboff, are \xe2\x80\x9cbeside the point\xe2\x80\x9d when parties demand what they bargained for in a valid agreement.  See Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \xc2\xa72(2), p. 15 (2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cA valid contract defines the obligations of the parties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment\xe2\x80\x9d).  In those circumstances, hewing to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 exchange yields \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity courts.  McCutchen offers us a slew of cases in which those courts applied the double-recovery or common-fund rule to limit insurers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to recoup funds from their beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 tort judgments.  See Brief for Respondents 21\xe2\x80\x9325.  But his citations are not on point.  In some of McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s cases, courts apparently applied equitable doctrines in the absence of any relevant contract provision.  See, e.g., Washtenaw Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Budd, 208 Mich. 483, 486\xe2\x80\x93487, 175 N.\xc2\xa0W. 231, 232 (1919); Fire Assn. of Philadelphia v. Wells, 84 N.\xc2\xa0J. Eq. 484, 487, 94 A. 619, 621 (1915).  In others, courts found those rules to comport with the applicable contract term.  For example, in Svea Assurance Co. v. Packham, 92 Md. 464, 48 A. 359 (1901)\xe2\x80\x94the case McCutchen calls his best, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348\xe2\x80\x94the court viewed the double-recovery rule as according with \xe2\x80\x9cthe intention\xe2\x80\x9d of the contracting parties; \xe2\x80\x9c[b]road as [the] language is,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, the agreement \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be construed to\xe2\x80\x9d give the insurer any greater recovery.  92 Md., at 478, 48 A., at 362; see also Knaffl v. Knoxville Banking &amp; Trust Co., 133 Tenn. 655, 661, 182 S.\xc2\xa0W. 232, 233 (1916); Camden Fire Ins. Assn. v. Prezioso, 93 N.\xc2\xa0J. Eq. 318, 319\xe2\x80\x93320, 116 A. 694, 694 (Ch. Div. 1922).  But in none of these cases\xe2\x80\x94nor in any other we can find\xe2\x80\x94did an equity court apply the double-recovery or common-fund rule to override a plain contract term.  That is, in none did an equity court do what McCutchen asks of us.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the United States, appearing as amicus curiae, claims that the common-fund rule has a special capacity to trump a conflicting contract.  The Government begins its brief foursquare with our (and Sereboff\xe2\x80\x99s) analysis: In a suit like this one, to enforce an equitable lien by agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe agreement, not general restitutionary principles of unjust enrichment, provides the measure of relief due.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 6.  Because that is so, the Government (naturally enough) concludes, McCutchen cannot invoke the double-recovery rule to defeat the plan.  But then the Government takes an unexpected turn.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to the costs incurred\xe2\x80\x9d by a beneficiary to obtain money from a third party, \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the plan do not control.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 21.  An equity court, the Government contends, has \xe2\x80\x9cinherent authority\xe2\x80\x9d to apportion litigation costs in accord with the \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding equitable common-fund doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d even if that conflicts with the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract.  Id., at 22.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if the agreement governs, the agreement governs: The reasons we have given (and the Government mostly ac- cepts) for looking to the contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms do not permit an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s-fees exception.  We have no doubt that the common-fund doctrine has deep roots in equity.  See Sprague v. Ticonic Nat. Bank, \n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 161, \n164 (1939)\n (tracing equity courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority over fees to the First Judiciary Act).  Those roots, however, are set in the soil of unjust enrichment: To allow \xe2\x80\x9cothers to obtain full benefit from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s efforts without contributing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the litigation expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d we have often noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to enrich the others unjustly at the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., \n\n396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375, \n392 (1970)\n; see Boeing, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478; Trustees v. Greenough, \n\n105 U.\xc2\xa0S. 527, \n532 (1882)\n; supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 and n. 4.  And as we have just explained, principles of unjust enrichment give way when a court enforces an equitable lien by agreement.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The agreement itself becomes the measure of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 equities; so if a contract abrogates the common-fund doctrine, the insurer is not unjustly enriched by claiming the benefit of its bargain.  That is why the Government, like McCutchen, fails to produce a single case in which an equity court applied the common-fund rule (any more than the double-recovery rule) when a contract provided to the contrary.  Even in equity, when a party sought to enforce a lien by agreement, all provisions of that agreement controlled.  So too, then, in a suit like this one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe result we reach, based on the historical analysis our prior cases prescribe, fits lock and key with ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s focus on what a plan provides.  The section under which this suit is brought \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not, after all, authorize \xe2\x80\x98appropriate equitable relief\xe2\x80\x99 at large,\xe2\x80\x9d Mertens, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253 (quoting \xc2\xa71132(a)(3)); rather, it countenances only such relief as will enforce \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d or the statute, \xc2\xa71132(a)(3) (emphasis added).  That limitation reflects ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s principal function: to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect contractually defined benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134, \n148 (1985)\n.  The statutory scheme, we have often noted, \xe2\x80\x9cis built around reliance on the face of written plan documents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73, \n83 (1995)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cEvery employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71102(a)(1), and an administrator must act \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\xe2\x80\x9d insofar as they accord with the statute, \xc2\xa71104(a)(1)(D).  The plan, in short, is at the center of ERISA.  And precluding McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s equitable defenses from overriding plain contract terms helps it to remain there.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s arguments are not all for naught.  If the equitable rules he describes cannot trump a reimbursement provision, they still might aid in properly construing it.  And for US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 plan, the common-fund doctrine (though not the double-recovery rule) serves that function.  The plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, and in those circumstances, the common-fund doctrine provides the appropriate default.  In other words, if US Airways wished to depart from the well-established common-fund rule, it had to draft its contract to say so\xe2\x80\x94and here it did not.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOrdinary principles of contract interpretation point toward this conclusion.  Courts construe ERISA plans, as they do other contracts, by \xe2\x80\x9clooking to the terms of the plan\xe2\x80\x9d as well as to \xe2\x80\x9cother manifestations of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101, \n113 (1989)\n.  The words of a plan may speak clearly, but they may also leave gaps.  And so a court must often \xe2\x80\x9clook outside the plan\xe2\x80\x99s written language\xe2\x80\x9d to decide what an agreement means.  CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 13); see Curtiss-Wright, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 80\xe2\x80\x9381.  In undertaking that task, a court properly takes account of background legal rules\xe2\x80\x94the doctrines that typically or traditionally have governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assoc. Health &amp; Welfare Plan v. Wells, 213 F.\xc2\xa03d 398, 402 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ontracts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are enacted against a background of common-sense understandings and legal principles that the parties may not have bothered to incorporate expressly but that operate as default rules to govern in the absence of a clear expression of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 [contrary] intent\xe2\x80\x9d); 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa731:7 (4th ed. 2012); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7221 (1979).  Indeed, ignoring those rules is likely to frustrate the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent and produce perverse consequences.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reimbursement provision at issue here precludes looking to the double-recovery rule in this manner.  Both the contract term and the equitable principle address the same problem: how to apportion, as between an insurer and a beneficiary, a third party\xe2\x80\x99s payment to recompense an injury.  But the allocation formulas they prescribe differ markedly.  According to the plan, US Airways has first claim on the entire recovery\xe2\x80\x94as the plan description states, on \xe2\x80\x9cany monies recovered from [the] third party\xe2\x80\x9d; McCutchen receives only whatever is left over (if anything).  See supra, at 3.  By contrast, the double-recovery rule would give McCutchen first dibs on the portion of the recovery compensating for losses that the plan did not cover (e.g., future earnings or pain and suffering); US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 claim would attach only to the share of the recovery for medical expenses.  See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The express contract term, in short, contradicts the background equitable rule; and where that is so, for all the reasons we have given, the agreement must govern.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, the plan provision here leaves space for the common-fund rule to operate.  That equitable doctrine, as earlier noted, addresses not how to allocate a third-party recovery, but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining it.  See supra, at 7.  And the contract, for its part, says nothing specific about that issue.  The District Court below thus erred when it found that the plan clearly repudiated the common-fund rule.  See supra, at 4.  To be sure, the plan\xe2\x80\x99s allocation formula\xe2\x80\x94first claim on the recovery goes to US Airways\xe2\x80\x94might operate on every dollar received from a third party, even those covering the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s litigation costs.  But alternatively, that formula could apply to only the true recovery, after the costs of obtaining it are deducted.  (Consider, for comparative purposes, how an income tax is levied on net, not gross, receipts.)  See Dawson, Lawyers and Involuntary Clients: Attorney Fees From Funds, 87 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1597, 1606\xe2\x80\x931607 (1974) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he claim for legal services is a first charge on the fund and must be satisfied before any distribution occurs\xe2\x80\x9d).  The plan\xe2\x80\x99s terms fail to select between these two alternatives: whether the recovery to which US Airways has first claim is every cent the third party paid or, instead, the money the beneficiary took away.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine provides the best indication of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  No one can doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here in the absence of a contrary agreement.  This Court has \xe2\x80\x9crecognized consistently\xe2\x80\x9d that someone \xe2\x80\x9cwho recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself\xe2\x80\x9d is due \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee from the fund as whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Boeing Co., 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 478.

State courts have done the same; the \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming majority\xe2\x80\x9d routinely use the common-fund rule to allocate the costs of third-party recoveries between insurers and beneficiaries.  8A Appleman \xc2\xa74903.85, at 335 (1981); see Annot., 2 A.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0R. 3d 1441, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x933 (1965 and Supp. 2012).  A party would not typically expect or intend a plan saying nothing about attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to abrogate so strong and uniform a background rule.  And that means a court should be loath to read such a plan in that way.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe rationale for the common-fund rule reinforces that conclusion.  Third-party recoveries do not often come free: To get one, an insured must incur lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s fees and expenses.  Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s efforts\xe2\x80\x94taking the fruits while contributing nothing to the labor.  Odder still, in some cases\xe2\x80\x94indeed, in this case\xe2\x80\x94the beneficiary is made worse off by pursuing a third party.  Recall that McCutchen spent $44,000 (representing a 40% contingency fee) to get $110,000, leaving him with a real recovery of $66,000.  But US Airways claimed $66,866 in medical expenses.  That would put McCutchen $866 in the hole; in effect, he would pay for the privilege of serving as US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 collection agent.  We think McCutchen would not have foreseen that result when he signed on to the plan.  And we doubt if even US Airways should want it.  When the next McCutchen comes along, he is not likely to relieve US Airways of the costs of recovery.  See Blackburn v. Sundstrand Corp., 115 F.\xc2\xa03d 493, 496 (CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. injured persons could not charge legal costs against recoveries, people like [McCutchen] would in the future have every reason\xe2\x80\x9d to make different judgments about bringing suit, \xe2\x80\x9cthrowing on plans the burden and expense of collection\xe2\x80\x9d).  The prospect of generating those strange results again militates against reading a general reimbursement provision\xe2\x80\x94like the one here\xe2\x80\x94for more than it is worth.  Only if US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 plan expressly addressed the costs of recovery would it alter the common-fund doctrine.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur holding today has two parts, one favoring US Airways, the other McCutchen.  First, in an action brought under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) based on an equitable lien by agreement, the terms of the ERISA plan govern.  Neither general principles of unjust enrichment nor specific doctrines reflecting those principles\xe2\x80\x94such as the double-recovery or common-fund rules\xe2\x80\x94can override the applicable contract.  We therefore reject the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  But second, the common-fund rule informs interpretation of US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 reimbursement provision.  Because that term does not advert to the costs of recovery, it is properly read to retain the common-fund doctrine.  We therefore also disagree with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  In light of these rulings, we vacate the judgment below and re- mand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We have made clear that the statements in a summary plan description \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicat[e] with beneficiaries about the plan, but .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. donot themselves constitute the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  CIGNA Corp. v.

The language the dissent highlights in McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition, indicating that the plan clearly abrogates the common-fund doctrine, comes from his description of US Airways\xe2\x80\x99 claim in the District Court.  See post, at 1 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Brief in Opposition 5.  McCutchen\xe2\x80\x99s argument in that court urged the very position we adopt\xe2\x80\x94that the common-fund doctrine applies because the plan is silent.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 2:08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x931593 (WD Pa., Dec. 4, 2011), Doc. 33, pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf [US Airways] wanted to exclude a deduction for attorney fees, it easily could have so expressed\xe2\x80\x9d).  To be sure, McCutchen shifted ground on appeal because the District Court ruled that Third Circuit precedent foreclosed his contract-based argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a; the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision then put front-and-center his alternative contention that the common-fund rule trumps a contract.  But both claims have the same basis (the nature and function of the common-fund doctrine), which the parties have disputed throughout this litigation.  And similarly, the question we decide here is included in the question presented.  The principal clause of that question asks whether a court may use \xe2\x80\x9cequitable principles to rewrite contractual language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.
