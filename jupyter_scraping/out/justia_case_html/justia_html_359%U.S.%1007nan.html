This is not the first time that state disbarment proceedings have been challenged as lacking in procedural due process. See Isserman v. Ethics Committee, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/927/case.html">345 U.S. 927</a> (dissent). Sometimes we can act on the face of the record as where no serious issues of fact are involved.

But the important questions presented here turn on factual issues. The return in this case contains allegations which, if proved, would suggest that the requirements of fair procedure, without which no citizen can be deprived of his livelihood, were not satisfied in the Ohio proceedings. </p><p> These complaints and Crow makes may prove to be as fanciful as he thinks the charges against him are.
