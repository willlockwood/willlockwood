Katzenbach, \n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301\n.  Section 2 of the Act, which bans any \xe2\x80\x9cstandard, practice, or procedure\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to vote on account of race or color,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and is not at issue in this case.

In those covered jurisdictions, \xc2\xa75 of the Act provides that no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by specified federal authorities in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  \xc2\xa71973c(a).  Such approval is known as \xe2\x80\x9cpreclearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized several times.  In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25 years, but the coverage formula was not changed.  Coverage still turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or 1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time.  Shortly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to bail out from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged the Act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  This Court resolved the challenge on statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Act\xe2\x80\x99s continued constitutionality.  See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v.

The District Court upheld the Act, finding that the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing \xc2\xa75 and continuing \xc2\xa74(b)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage formula.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  After surveying the evidence in the record, that court accepted Congress\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xc2\xa72 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, that \xc2\xa75 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage formula continued to pass constitutional muster.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.

States retain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and pursuing legislative objectives.  Indeed, the \n \nTenth Amendment reserves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal Government, including \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to regulate elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452\n\xe2\x80\x93462.  There is also a \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d among the States, which is highly pertinent in assessing disparate treatment of States.  Northwest Austin, supra, at 203.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.  It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own.  And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).  That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as \xe2\x80\x9cstringent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpotent,\xe2\x80\x9d Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308, 315, 337.  The Court nonetheless upheld the Act, concluding that such an \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon exercise of congressional power\xe2\x80\x9d could be justified by \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 334.

At the time, the coverage formula\xe2\x80\x94the means of linking the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that warranted it\xe2\x80\x94made sense.  The Act was limited to areas where Congress found \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of actual voting discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d and the covered jurisdictions shared two characteristics: \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of tests and devices for voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential election at least 12 points below the national average.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 330.  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Court therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe coverage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Largely because of the Voting Rights Act, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]oter turnout and registration rates\xe2\x80\x9d in covered jurisdictions \xe2\x80\x9cnow approach parity.  Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare.  And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin, supra, at 202.  The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years.  Yet the Act has not eased \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions or narrowed the scope of \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s coverage formula along the way.  Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they have grown even stronger.  Because \xc2\xa75 applies only to those jurisdictions singled out by \xc2\xa74, the Court turns to consider that provision.

It looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.  By 2009, however, the \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin, supra, at 204.  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices.  The formula captures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s.  But such tests have been banned for over 40 years.  And voter registration and turnout numbers in covered States have risen dramatically.  In 1965, the States could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter registration and turnout and those without those characteristics.  Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.  Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds that it is \xe2\x80\x9creverse-engineered\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Congress identified the jurisdictions to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them.  Katzenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that the coverage formula was rational because the \xe2\x80\x9cformula .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was relevant to the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329, 330.  The Government has a fallback argument\xe2\x80\x94because the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the States identified in 1965.  But this does not look to \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent political conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a comparison between the States in 1965.  But history did not end in 1965.  In assessing the \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent need[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d for a preclearance system treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965 cannot be ignored.  The \n \nFifteenth Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.  To serve that purpose, Congress\xe2\x80\x94if it is to divide the States\xe2\x80\x94must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.

Regardless of how one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cflagrant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crampant\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation in 1965.  Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331.  But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current conditions.  It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.

Section 5 of the Act required States to obtain federal permission before enacting any law related to voting\xe2\x80\x94a drastic departure from basic principles of federalism.  And \xc2\xa74 of the Act applied that requirement only to some States\xe2\x80\x94an equally dramatic departure from the principle that all States enjoy equal sovereignty.  This was strong medicine, but Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, \xe2\x80\x9can insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, \n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301, \n309 (1966)\n.

There is no denying, however, that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.  By 2009, \xe2\x80\x9cthe racial gap in voter registration and turnout [was] lower in the States originally covered by \xc2\xa75 than it [was] nationwide.\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193\n\xe2\x80\x93204 (2009).  Since that time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-American voter turnout has come to exceed white voter turnout in five of the six States originally covered by \xc2\xa75, with a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one percent.

The current version forbids any \xe2\x80\x9cstandard, practice, or procedure\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(a).  Both the Federal Government and individuals have sued to enforce \xc2\xa72, see, e.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 997 (1994)\n, and injunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block voting laws from going into effect, see \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973j(d).  Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide, and is not at issue in this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther sections targeted only some parts of the country.  At the time of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s passage, these \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdictions were those States or political subdivisions that had maintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as of November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.  \xc2\xa74(b), \n\n79Stat.\n438.  Such tests or devices included literacy and knowledge tests, good moral character requirements, the need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like.  \xc2\xa74(c), id., at 438\xe2\x80\x93439.  A covered jurisdiction could \xe2\x80\x9cbail out\xe2\x80\x9d of coverage if it had not used a test or device in the preceding five years \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74(a), id., at 438.  In 1965, the covered States included Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia.  The additional covered subdivisions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in Arizona.

Section 5 provided that no change in voting procedures could take effect until it was approved by federal authorities in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.\xe2\x80\x94either the Attorney General or a court of three judges.  Id., at 439.  A jurisdiction could obtain such \xe2\x80\x9cpreclearance\xe2\x80\x9d only by proving that the change had neither \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose [nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they were set to expire after five years.  See \xc2\xa74(a), id., at 438; Northwest Austin, supra, at 199.  In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional challenge, explaining that it was justified to address \xe2\x80\x9cvoting discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five years, and extended the coverage formula in \xc2\xa74(b) to jurisdictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout as of 1968.

Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7101, 202, \n\n89Stat.\n400,\n401.  Congress also amended the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctest or device\xe2\x80\x9d to include the practice of providing English-only voting materials in places where over five percent of voting-age citizens spoke a single language other than English.  \xc2\xa7203, id., at 401\xe2\x80\x93402.  As a result of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona, and Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-ida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-kota, became covered jurisdictions.  See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.  Congress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to forbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in a language minority group, in addition to discrimination on the basis of race or color.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7203, 206, \n\n89Stat.\n401,\n402.  Finally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and devices permanent.  \xc2\xa7102, id., at 400.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but did not alter its coverage formula.  See Voting Rights Act Amendments, \n\n96Stat.\n131.  Congress did, however, amend the bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of covered jurisdictions to bail out.  Among other prerequisites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must not have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive preclearance, or lost a \xc2\xa72 suit, in the ten years prior to seeking bailout.  \xc2\xa72, id., at 131\xe2\x80\x93133.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe upheld each of these reauthorizations against constitutional challenge.

Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amend-ments Act, \n\n120Stat.\n577.  Congress also amended \xc2\xa75 to prohibit more conduct than before.  \xc2\xa75, id., at 580\xe2\x80\x93 581; see Reno v.

Section 5 now forbids voting changes with \xe2\x80\x9cany discriminatory purpose\xe2\x80\x9d as well as voting changes that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race, color, or language minority status, \xe2\x80\x9cto elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973c(b)\xe2\x80\x93(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tShortly after this reauthorization, a Texas utility district brought suit, seeking to bail out from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s cover- age and, in the alternative, challenging the Act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  See Northwest Austin, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 200\xe2\x80\x93201.  A three-judge District Court explained that only a State or political subdivision was eligible to seek bailout under the statute, and concluded that the utility district was not a political subdivision, a term that encompassed only \xe2\x80\x9ccounties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 221, 232 (DC 2008).  The District Court also rejected the constitutional challenge.

We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin, supra, at 205 (quoting Escambia County v. McMillan, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 48, \n51 (1984)\n (per curiam)).  Concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying constitutional concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d among other things, \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[led] a broader reading of the bailout provision,\xe2\x80\x9d we construed the statute to allow the utility district to seek bailout.  Northwest Austin, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 207.  In doing so we expressed serious doubts about the Act\xe2\x80\x99s con-tinued constitutionality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe explained that \xc2\xa75 \xe2\x80\x9cimposes substantial federalism costs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdifferentiates between the States, despite our his- toric tradition that all the States enjoy equal sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 202, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).   We also noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hings have changed in the South.  Voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.  Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare.  And minority candidates hold office at unprece-dented levels.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 202.  Finally, we questioned whether the problems that \xc2\xa75 meant to address were still \xe2\x80\x9cconcentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 203.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEight Members of the Court subscribed to these views, and the remaining Member would have held the Act unconstitutional.  Ultimately, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the bailout provision left the constitutional issues for another day.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tShelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdiction.  It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General has recently objected to voting changes proposed from within the county.  See App. 87a\xe2\x80\x9392a.  Instead, in 2010, the county sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against their enforcement.  The District Court ruled against the county and upheld the Act.  811 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 424, 508 (2011).  The court found that the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing \xc2\xa75 and continuing the \xc2\xa74(b) coverage formula.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  In assessing \xc2\xa75, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit considered six primary categories of evidence: Attorney General objections to voting changes, Attorney General requests for more information regarding voting changes, successful \xc2\xa72 suits in covered jurisdictions, the dispatching of federal observers to monitor elections in covered jurisdictions, \xc2\xa75 preclearance suits involving covered jurisdictions, and the deterrent effect of \xc2\xa75.  See 679 F.\xc2\xa03d 848, 862\xe2\x80\x93863 (2012).  After extensive analysis of the record, the court accepted Congress\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xc2\xa72 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, and that \xc2\xa75 was therefore still necessary.

Circuit noted that the evidence for singling out the covered jurisdictions was \xe2\x80\x9cless robust\xe2\x80\x9d and that the issue presented \xe2\x80\x9ca close question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 879.  But the court looked to data comparing the number of successful \xc2\xa72 suits in the different parts of the country.  Coupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of \xc2\xa75, the court concluded that the statute continued \xe2\x80\x9cto single out the jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus held that the coverage formula passed constitutional muster.

He found \xe2\x80\x9cno positive cor-relation between inclusion in \xc2\xa74(b)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage formula and low black registration or turnout.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 891.  Rather, to the extent there was any correlation, it actually went the other way: \xe2\x80\x9ccondemnation under \xc2\xa74(b) is a marker of higher black registration and turnout.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Judge Williams also found that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]overed jurisdictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion of the black population than do uncovered ones.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 892.  As to the evidence of successful \xc2\xa72 suits, Judge Williams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have worse records than eight of the covered jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 897.  He also noted that two covered jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94Arizona and Alaska\xe2\x80\x94had not had any successful reported \xc2\xa72 suit brought against them during the entire 24 years covered by the data.  Ibid.  Judge Williams would have held the coverage formula of \xc2\xa74(b) \xe2\x80\x9cirrational\xe2\x80\x9d and unconstitutional.

While one State waits months or years and expends funds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor can typically put the same law into effect immediately, through the normal legislative process.  Even if a noncovered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences between those proceedings and preclearance proceedings; the preclearance proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cnot only switches the burden of proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies substantive standards quite different from those governing the rest of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  679 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 884 (Williams, J., dissenting) (case below).  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in 1966, we described it as \xe2\x80\x9cstringent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpotent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308, 315, 337.

The \xe2\x80\x9cblight of racial discrimination in voting\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cinfected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century.\xe2\x80\x9d  Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 308.  Several States had enacted a variety of requirements and tests \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically designed to prevent\xe2\x80\x9d African-Americans from voting.  Id., at 310.  Case-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent such racial discrimination in voting, in part because States \xe2\x80\x9cmerely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal decrees,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cenacted difficult new tests,\xe2\x80\x9d or simply \xe2\x80\x9cdefied and evaded court orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 314.  Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act, only 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were registered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisiana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi.

We found that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328.  The areas where Congress found \xe2\x80\x9cevidence of actual voting discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d shared two characteristics: \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of tests and devices for voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential election at least 12 points below the national average.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 330.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We therefore concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe coverage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

See Bossier II, 528 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 324, 335\xe2\x80\x93336.  In 2006, Congress amended \xc2\xa75 to prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but did not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c(c), even though we had stated that such broadening of \xc2\xa75 coverage would \xe2\x80\x9cexacerbate the substantial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure already exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns about \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality,\xe2\x80\x9d Bossier II, supra, at 336 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, Congress expanded \xc2\xa75 to prohibit any voting law \xe2\x80\x9cthat has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d on account of race, color, or language minority status, \xe2\x80\x9cto elect their preferred candidates of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71973c(b).

Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage formula was rational because the \xe2\x80\x9cformula .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was relevant to the problem\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cTests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 329, 330.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, by contrast, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reverse- engineering argument does not even attempt to demonstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem it targets.  And in the context of a decision as significant as this one\xe2\x80\x94subjecting a disfavored subset of States to \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system,\xe2\x80\x9d Northwest Austin, supra, at 211\xe2\x80\x94that failure to establish even relevance is fatal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government falls back to the argument that because the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the States Congress identified back then\xe2\x80\x94regardless of how that discrimination compares to discrimination in States unburdened by coverage.  Brief for Federal Respondent 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  This argument does not look to \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent political conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead relies on a comparison between the States in 1965.  That comparison reflected the different histories of the North and South.  It was in the South that slavery was upheld by law until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim Crow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms, and that state and local governments worked tirelessly to disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race.  The Court invoked that history\xe2\x80\x94rightly so\xe2\x80\x94in sustaining the disparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966.  See Katzenbach, supra, at 308 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut history did not end in 1965.  By the time the Act was reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of it.  In assessing the \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent need[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d for a preclearance system that treats States differently from one another today, that history cannot be ignored.  During that time, largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained political office in record numbers.  And yet the coverage formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-evant to decades-old problems, rather than current data reflecting current needs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \n \nFifteenth Amendment commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command.  The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.  See Rice v. Cayetano, \n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495, \n512 (2000)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cConsistent with the design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment is cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the particular controversy which was the immediate impetus for its enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d).  To serve that purpose, Congress\xe2\x80\x94if it is to divide the States\xe2\x80\x94must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.  It cannot rely simply on the past.  We made that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear again today.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn defending the coverage formula, the Government, the intervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from the record that they claim justify disparate coverage.  Congress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act.  The court below and the parties have debated what that record shows\xe2\x80\x94they have gone back and forth about whether to compare covered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to disaggregate the data State by State, how to weigh \xc2\xa72 cases as evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to consider evidence not before Congress, among other issues.  Compare, e.g., 679 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 873\xe2\x80\x93883 (case below), with id., at 889\xe2\x80\x93902 (Williams, J., dissenting).  Regardless of how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cflagrant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crampant\xe2\x80\x9d discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that time.  Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest Austin, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions.  It instead reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.  The dissent relies on \xe2\x80\x9csecond-generation barriers,\xe2\x80\x9d which are not impediments to the casting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that affect the weight of minority votes.  That does not cure the problem.  Viewing the preclearance requirements as targeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of continued reliance on the \xc2\xa74 coverage formula, which is based on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote dilution.  We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an updated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute ourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s contention, see post, at 23, we are not ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it played no role in shaping the statutory formula before us today.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in light of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county cannot complain about the provisions that subject it to preclearance.  Post, at 23\xe2\x80\x9330.  But that is like saying that a driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all redheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out his license has expired.  Shelby County\xe2\x80\x99s claim is that the coverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its applications, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-jected to preclearance.  The county was selected based on that formula, and may challenge it in court. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent proceeds from a flawed premise.  It quotes the famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819), with the following emphasis: \xe2\x80\x9cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 9 (emphasis in dissent).  But this case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent does not emphasize\xe2\x80\x94the part that asks whether a legislative means is \xe2\x80\x9cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  The dissent states that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t cannot tenably be maintained\xe2\x80\x9d that this is an issue with regard to the Voting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an opinion joined by two of today\xe2\x80\x99s dissenters, the Court expressly stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Act\xe2\x80\x99s preclearance requirement and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Northwest Austin, supra, at 204.  The dissent does not explain how those \xe2\x80\x9cserious constitutional questions\xe2\x80\x9d became untenable in four short years.    \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any other piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear from the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from ordinary.  At the risk of repetition, Katzenbach indicated that the Act was \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot otherwise appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d but was justified by \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunique\xe2\x80\x9d conditions.  383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 334, 335.  Multiple decisions since have reaffirmed the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d nature.  See, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211.  Yet the dissent goes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance requirement and disparate treatment of the States should be upheld into the future \xe2\x80\x9cunless there [is] no or almost no evidence of unconstitutional action by States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 33.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the ques- tion presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never happened.  For example, the dissent refuses to con- sider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest Austin\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on its significance.  Northwest Austin also emphasized the \xe2\x80\x9cdramatic\xe2\x80\x9d progress since 1965, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of discrimination as \xe2\x80\x9cflagrant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpervasive,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Despite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate geographic coverage\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently related\xe2\x80\x9d to its targeted problems, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203, the dissent maintains that an Act\xe2\x80\x99s limited coverage actually eases Congress\xe2\x80\x99s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous relationship should suffice.  Although Northwest Austin stated definitively that \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent burdens\xe2\x80\x9d must be justified by \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent needs,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage formula can be justified by history, and that the required showing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law was first passed.    \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-mula from review merely because it was previously enacted 40 years ago.  If Congress had started from scratch in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula.  It would have been irrational for Congress to distinguish between States in such a fundamental way based on 40-year-old data, when today\xe2\x80\x99s statistics tell an entirely different story.  And it would have been irrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago, when such tests have been illegal since that time.  But that is exactly what Congress has done.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStriking down an Act of Congress \xe2\x80\x9cis the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blodgett v.

That is why, in 2009, we took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead resolved the case then before us on statutory grounds.  But in issuing that decision, we expressed our broader concerns about the constitutionality of the Act.  Congress could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but did not do so.  Its failure to act leaves us today with no choice but to declare \xc2\xa74(b) unconstitutional.  The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in \xc2\xa72.  We issue no holding on \xc2\xa75 itself, only on the coverage formula.  Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions.  Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that exceptional conditions still exist justifying such an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the Federal Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Presley, 502 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.

Congress was of another mind.  Recognizing that large progress has been made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous record, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extirpated.  The question this case presents is who decides whether, as currently operative, \xc2\xa75 remains justifiable,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to enforce the post-Civil War Amendments \xe2\x80\x9cby appropriate legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  With overwhelming support in both Houses, Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, \xc2\xa75 should continue in force, unabated.  First, continuance would facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far made; and second, continuance would guard against backsliding.  Those assessments were well within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 province to make and should elicit this Court\xe2\x80\x99s unstinting approbation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 2.  But the Court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to combat voting discrimination where other remedies had been tried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting laws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated records of rank discrimination against minority voting rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA century after the Fourteenth and \n \nFifteenth Amendments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of discrimination on the basis of race, the \xe2\x80\x9cblight of racial discrimination in voting\xe2\x80\x9d continued to \xe2\x80\x9cinfec[t] the electoral process in parts of our country.\xe2\x80\x9d  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, \n\n383 U.\xc2\xa0S. 301, \n308 (1966)\n.  Early attempts to cope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.  Whenever one form of voting discrimination was identified and prohibited, others sprang up in its place.  This Court repeatedly encountered the remarkable \xe2\x80\x9cvariety and persistence\xe2\x80\x9d of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.  Id., at 311.  To take just one example, the Court, in 1927, held unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters from participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon, \n\n273 U.\xc2\xa0S. 536\n; in 1944, the Court struck down a \xe2\x80\x9creenacted\xe2\x80\x9d and slightly altered version of the same law, Smith v. Allwright, \n\n321 U.\xc2\xa0S. 649\n; and in 1953, the Court once again confronted an attempt by Texas to \xe2\x80\x9ccircumven[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the \n \nFifteenth Amendment by adopting yet another variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams, \n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 461\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDuring this era, the Court recognized that discrimination against minority voters was a quintessentially political problem requiring a political solution.  As Justice Holmes explained: If \xe2\x80\x9cthe great mass of the white population intends to keep the blacks from voting,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crelief from [that] great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the people of a State and the State itself, must be given by them or by the legislative and political department of the government of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Giles v. Harris, \n\n189 U.\xc2\xa0S. 475, \n488 (1903)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress learned from experience that laws targeting particular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case litigation were inadequate to the task.  In the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and then expanded the power of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General to seek injunctions against public and private interference with the right to vote on racial grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313.  But circumstances reduced the ameliorative potential of these legislative Acts:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cVoting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, sometimes requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent combing through registration records in preparation for trial.  Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded voting officials and others involved in the proceed-ings.  Even when favorable decisions have finally been obtained, some of the States affected have merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests designed to prolong the existing disparity between white and Negro registration.  Alternatively, certain local officials have defied and evaded court orders or have simply closed their registration offices to freeze the voting rolls.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tPatently, a new approach was needed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnswering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s his-tory.  Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting laws in the covered jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x94those States and localities where opposition to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s commands were most virulent\xe2\x80\x94the VRA provided a fit solution for minority voters as well as for States.  Under the preclearance regime established by \xc2\xa75 of the VRA, covered jurisdictions must submit proposed changes in voting laws or procedures to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has 60 days to respond to the changes.  \n\n79Stat.\n439, codified at \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c(a).

In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek approval by a three-judge District Court in the District of Columbia.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter a century\xe2\x80\x99s failure to fulfill the promise of the Fourteenth and \n \nFifteenth Amendments, passage of the VRA finally led to signal improvement on this front.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Justice Department estimated that in the five years after [the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to vote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century before 1965.\xe2\x80\x9d  Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief History, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B. Grofman &amp; C. Davidson eds. 1992).  And in assessing the overall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first generation barriers experienced by minority voters, including increased numbers of registered minority voters, minority voter turnout, and minority representation in Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.  This progress is the direct result of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 (hereinafter 2006 Reauthorization), \xc2\xa72(b)(1), \n\n120Stat.\n577.  On that matter of cause and effects there can be no genuine doubt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the realization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date, surely has not eliminated all vestiges of discrimination against the exercise of the franchise by minority citizens.  Jurisdictions covered by the preclearance requirement continued to submit, in large numbers, proposed changes to voting laws that the Attorney General declined to approve, auguring that barriers to minority voting would quickly resurface were the preclearance remedy elimi-nated.  City of Rome v. United States, \n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156, \n181 (1980)\n.  Congress also found that as \xe2\x80\x9cregistration and voting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures may be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority voting strength.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93196, p.\xc2\xa010 (1975)).  See also Shaw v. Reno, \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, \n640 (1993)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t soon became apparent that guaranteeing equal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other racially discriminatory voting practices\xe2\x80\x9d such as voting dilution).  Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the bal- lot, are aptly described as \xe2\x80\x9csecond-generation barriers\xe2\x80\x9d to minority voting.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond-generation barriers come in various forms.  One of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing of legislative districts in an \xe2\x80\x9ceffort to segregate the races for purposes of voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 642.  Another is adoption of a system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district voting in a city with a sizable black minority.  By switching to at-large voting, the overall majority could control the election of each city council member, effectively eliminating the potency of the minority\xe2\x80\x99s votes.  Grofman &amp; Davidson, The Effect of Municipal Election Structure on Black Representation in Eight Southern States, in Quiet Revolution in the South 301, 319 (C. Davidson &amp; B. Grofman eds. 1994) (hereinafter Quiet Revolution).  A similar effect could be achieved if the city engaged in discriminatory annexation by incorporating majority-white areas into city limits, thereby decreasing the effect of VRA-occasioned increases in black voting.  Whatever the device employed, this Court has long recognized that vote dilution, when adopted with a discriminatory purpose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of access to the ballot.

Morgan, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 641, \n653 (1966)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUntil today, in considering the constitutionality of the VRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of respect its judgments in this domain should garner.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach supplies the standard of review: \xe2\x80\x9cAs against the reserved powers of the States, Congress may use any rational means to effectuate the constitu-tional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting.\xe2\x80\x9d  383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 324.  Faced with subsequent reauthorizations of the VRA, the Court has reaffirmed this standard.  E.g., City of Rome, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s Court does not purport to alter settled precedent establishing that the dispositive question is whether Congress has employed \xe2\x80\x9crational means.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing statute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal requirements of the rational-basis test.  First, when reauthorization is at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative record justifying the initial legislation.  Congress is en-titled to consider that preexisting record as well as the record before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.  This is especially true where, as here, the Court has repeatedly affirmed the statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality and Congress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.  See id., at 174 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe appellants are asking us to do nothing less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v. Katzenbach .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , in which we upheld the constitutionality of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d); Lopez v. Monterey County, \n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 266, \n283 (1999)\n (similar).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary arises because Congress has built a temporal limitation into the Act.  It has pledged to review, after a span of years (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary evidence, the continued need for the VRA.  Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 306, \n343 (2003)\n (anticipating, but not guaranteeing, that, in 25 years, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of racial preferences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, a reviewing court should expect the record supporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record originally made.  Demand for a record of violations equivalent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a catch-22.  If the statute was working, there would be less evidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that Congress should not be allowed to renew the statute.  In contrast, if the statute was not working, there would be plenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to renew a failed regulatory regime.  See Persily 193\xe2\x80\x93194.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis is not to suggest that congressional power in this area is limitless.  It is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to ensure that Congress has used appropriate means.  The question meet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are \xe2\x80\x9cadapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ex parte Virginia, \n\n100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339, \n346 (1880)\n.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that of Congress, but to determine whether the legislative record sufficed to show that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could rationally have determined that [its chosen] provisions were appropriate methods.\xe2\x80\x9d  City of Rome, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 176\xe2\x80\x93177.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn summary, the Constitution vests broad power in Congress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to combat racial discrimination in voting.  This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prerogative to use any rational means in exercise of its power in this area.  And both precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means test should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s challenger should be higher, when what is at issue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has previously affirmed, and that Congress found, from contemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate objective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully satisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421: Congress may choose any means \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cplainly adapted to\xe2\x80\x9d a legitimate constitutional end.

The surest way to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is to see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discriminatory changes to voting laws.  See City of Rome, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 181 (identifying \xe2\x80\x9cinformation on the number and types of submissions made by covered jurisdictions and the number and nature of objections interposed by the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x9d as a primary basis for upholding the 1975 reauthorization).  On that score, the record before Congress was huge.  In fact, Congress found there were more DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than there were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization (490).  1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need, Hearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued Need).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked over 700 voting changes based on a determination that the changes were discriminatory.

And litigation places a heavy financial burden on minority voters.  See id., at 84.  Congress also received evidence that preclearance lessened the litigation burden on covered jurisdictions themselves, because the preclearance process is far less costly than defending against a \xc2\xa72 claim, and clearance by DOJ substantially reduces the likelihood that a \xc2\xa72 claim will be mounted.

While racially polarized voting alone does not signal a constitutional violation, it is a factor that increases the vulnerability of racial minorities to dis-criminatory changes in voting law.  The reason is twofold.  First, racial polarization means that racial minorities are at risk of being systematically outvoted and having their interests underrepresented in legislatures.  Second, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen political preferences fall along racial lines, the natural inclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench themselves have predictable racial effects.

In today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Court ratchets up what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing breadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contradiction of Katzenbach.  The Court does so with nary an explanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone any discussion of whether stare decisis nonetheless counsels adherence to Katzenbach\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the limited \xe2\x80\x9csignificance\xe2\x80\x9d of the equal sovereignty principle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented extension of the equal sover-eignty principle outside its proper domain\xe2\x80\x94the admission of new States\xe2\x80\x94is capable of much mischief.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (suggesting that proof of egregious episodes of racial discrimination in covered jurisdictions would not suffice to carry the day for the VRA, unless such episodes are shown to be absent elsewhere).

Volumes of evidence supported Congress\xe2\x80\x99 de-termination that the prospect of retrogression was real.

Even if the legislative record shows, as engaging with it would reveal, that the formula accurately identifies the jurisdictions with the worst conditions of voting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court sees it.

Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328.

By then, the formula had been in effect for many years, and all of the jurisdictions covered by it were \xe2\x80\x9cfamiliar to Congress by name.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 328.  The question before Congress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support continued application of the preclearance remedy in each of those already-identified places?  There was at that point no chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in new areas that were not the subject of congressional findings.  And Congress could determine from the record whether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for-mula still belonged under the preclearance regime.  If they did, there was no need to alter the formula.  That is why the Court, in addressing prior reauthorizations of the VRA, did not question the continuing \xe2\x80\x9crelevance\xe2\x80\x9d of the formula.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider once again the components of the record before Congress in 2006.  The coverage provision identified a known list of places with an undisputed history of serious problems with racial discrimination in voting.  Recent evidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there for all to see.  Multiple Supreme Court decisions had upheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.  There was extensive evidence that, due to the preclearance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions had notably improved.  And there was evidence that preclearance was still having a substantial real-world effect, having stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes in the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.  In addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in voting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere, increasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those jurisdictions.  And countless witnesses, reports, and case studies documented continuing problems with voting dis-crimination in those jurisdictions.  In light of this rec- ord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to conclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of sync with conditions on the ground in covered areas.  And certainly Shelby County was no candidate for release through the mechanism Congress provided.  See supra, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323, 26\xe2\x80\x9328.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court holds \xc2\xa74(b) invalid on the ground that it is \xe2\x80\x9cirrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago, when such tests have been illegal since that time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 23.  But the Court disregards what Congress set about to do in enacting the VRA.  That extraordinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests and devices that happened to exist in 1965.  The grand aim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizenship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.  As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abundantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as attempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that originally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 8, 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe sad irony of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective.  The Court appears to believe that the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclearance is no longer needed.  Ante, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322, 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  With that belief, and the argument derived from it, history repeats itself.  The same assumption\xe2\x80\x94that the problem could be solved when particular methods of voting discrimination are identified and eliminated\xe2\x80\x94was indulged and proved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Unlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or devices, the VRA is grounded in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 recognition of the \xe2\x80\x9cvariety and persistence\xe2\x80\x9d of measures designed to impair minority voting rights.  Katzenbach, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 311; supra, at 2.  In truth, the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBeyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation.  It is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize the purpose and promise of the \n \nFifteenth Amendment.  For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to end racial discrimination in voting.  Thanks to the Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA is also extraordinary.

Rec. H5143 (July 13, 2006) (statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner).  After exhaustive evidence-gathering and deliberative process, Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support.  It was the judgment of Congress that \xe2\x80\x9c40 years has not been a sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard for the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  2006 Reauthorization \xc2\xa72(b)(7), \n\n120Stat.\n577.
