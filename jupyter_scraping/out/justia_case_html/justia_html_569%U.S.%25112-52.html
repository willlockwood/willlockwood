Although \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation\xe2\x80\x99s one conspicuous alteration\xe2\x80\x94addition of the words \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to the transportation of property\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94significantly limits the FAAAA\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope.  It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the \xe2\x80\x9cprice, route, or service\xe2\x80\x9d of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also concern a motor carrier\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation of property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Title 49 defines \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation,\xe2\x80\x9d in relevant part, as \xe2\x80\x9cservices related to th[e] movement\xe2\x80\x9d of property, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding arranging for .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. storage [and] handling.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa713102(23)(B).  Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s Consumer Protection Act and negligence claims are not \xe2\x80\x9crelated to th[e] movement\xe2\x80\x9d of his car.  Chapter 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation\xe2\x80\x94here, by towing\xe2\x80\x94has ended.  Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored.  Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City maintains that because \xc2\xa713102(23)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9cstorage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chandling,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims fall within \xc2\xa714501(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive ambit.  But \xe2\x80\x9cstorage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chandling\xe2\x80\x9d fit within \xc2\xa713102(23)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s definition only when those services \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to th[e] movement\xe2\x80\x9d of property.  Thus temporary storage of an item in transit en route to its final destination qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation,\xe2\x80\x9d but permanent storage does not.  Here, no storage occurred in the course of transporting Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims are also unrelated to a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d a motor carrier renders its customers.

Because chapter 262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses \xe2\x80\x9cstorage compan[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgarage owner[s] or keeper[s],\xe2\x80\x9d not transportation activities, it has neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services a motor carrier offers its customers.

But exceptions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in themselves delineate the scope of the rule.  Here, the exceptions identify matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDan\xe2\x80\x99s City also maintains that Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims are \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d its towing service because selling Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s car was the means by which Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City obtained payment for the tow.  If such state-law claims were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute arising from a towing company\xe2\x80\x99s disposal of a vehicle previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.

The New Hampshire law in point regulates no towing services, no carriage of prop- erty.  Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles seeking to sell them.

Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition, Pelkey did not know his car had been towed.  Soon after removal of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for a procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he suffered a heart attack.  He remained under hospital care until his discharge on April 9, 2007.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnaware of Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s identity or illness, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City sought permission from New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Public Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.

On April 17, Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s attorney informed  Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and  reclaim his vehicle.

Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City overlooks, however, that under \xc2\xa713102(23)(B), services such as \xe2\x80\x9cstorage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chandling\xe2\x80\x9d fit within the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation\xe2\x80\x9d only when those services \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to th[e] movement\xe2\x80\x9d of property.  Temporary storage of an item in transit en route to its final destination relates to the movement of property and therefore fits within \xc2\xa713102(23)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s definition.

Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City\xe2\x80\x99s storage of Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s car after the towing job was done, in short, does not involve \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the federal Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims also survive preemption under \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d a motor carrier renders its customers.

He sued under state consumer protection and tort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful disposal of his vehicle.  The state laws in question hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a motor carrier to offer services not available in the market.

First, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City contends that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regulation of motor carriers only when the State\xe2\x80\x99s law comes within a specified exception.  Because Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims do not fit within any exception to preemption, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City urges, those claims must be preempted.  This argument exceeds sensible bounds.  Exceptions to a general rule, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in themselves delineate the scope of the rule.  The exceptions to \xc2\xa714501(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule of preemption identify matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn example may clarify the point.  Section 14501(c) does not exempt zoning regulations.  Such laws, however, \xe2\x80\x9care peculiarly within the province of state and local legislative authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warth v. Seldin, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490\n, n.\xc2\xa018 (1975).  It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation of the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls outside the preemptive sweep of \xc2\xa714501(c)(1).  That is so because zoning ordinances ordinarily are not \xe2\x80\x9crelated to  a price, route, or service of any motor carrier .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with re- spect to the transportation of property.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa714501(c)(1).  The same is true of New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of the dis- posal of stored vehicles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDan\xe2\x80\x99s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.  Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City maintains, are \xe2\x80\x9crelated to\xe2\x80\x9d the towing service it rendered because selling Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s car was the means by which Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City obtained payment for the tow.  But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute arising from a towing company\xe2\x80\x99s disposal of a vehicle previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.  Federal law does not speak to these issues.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, not only would the preemption urged by Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City leave vehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would eliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing com- pany\xe2\x80\x99s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed.  No such design can be attributed to a rational Congress.  See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n251 (1984)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City cannot have it both ways.  It cannot rely on New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory framework as authorization for the sale of Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s car, yet argue that Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.   New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s legislation on abandoned vehicles gave rise to Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s debt and established the conditions under which Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City could collect on that debt by selling Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s Honda.  See N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7262:33, 262:36\xe2\x80\x93a, 262:40\xe2\x80\x93a; supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x935.  Pelkey\xe2\x80\x99s claims, attacking Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in disposing of the vehicle, rest on the very same provisions.  See Brief for Petitioner 41 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll of the alleged wrongful conduct of Dan\xe2\x80\x99s City was part of the state sanctioned and regulated process for disposing of abandoned vehicles under Ch. 262.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons stated, we hold that \n\n49 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims for dam- ages stemming from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle.
