On appeal, Tapia argued that lengthening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18 U.

Relying on Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a prison term to assist a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation, but once imprisonment is chosen, the court may consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation needs in setting the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s length.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation.

Because that system produced \xe2\x80\x9cserious disparities in [the] sentences\xe2\x80\x9d imposed on similarly situated defendants, <em>id.,</em> at 365, and failed to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve rehabilitation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines would provide courts with \xe2\x80\x9ca range of determinate sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 368.  Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least imprisonment, probation, or a fine.  See \xc2\xa73551(b).  In determining the appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, \xc2\xa73553(a)(2), but a particular purpose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.  As relevant here, a court ordering imprisonment must \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73582(a).  A similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sentencing Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 author, to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment when \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and \xe2\x80\xa6 [when] determining the length of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Amicus, </em>appointed to defend the judgment below, argues that the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause is merely a caution for judges not to put too<em> </em>much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.  But his alternative interpretation is unpersuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in \xc2\xa73582(a).  <em>Amicus</em> also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning that \xc2\xa73582\xe2\x80\x99s term \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the determination of the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s length.  Because \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d most naturally means \xe2\x80\x9cthe state of being confined\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca period of confinement,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not distinguish between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial placement behind bars and his continued stay there.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s context supports this textual conclusion.  By restating \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to implement the statutory determination to \xe2\x80\x9creject imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 367.  Equally illuminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.  When Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave them authority to do so.  See, <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa73563(b)(9).  In fact, although a sentencing court can recommend that an offender be placed in a particular facility or program, see \xc2\xa73582(a), the authority to make the placement rests with the Bureau of Prisons, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa73621(e).  The point is well illustrated here, where the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s strong recommendations that Tapia participate in RDAP and be placed in a particular facility went unfulfilled.  Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report on the SRA provides corroborating evidence.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus\xe2\x80\x99</em> attempts to recast what the SRA says about rehabilitation are unavailing.

A court does not err by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs.  But the record indicates that the District Court may have increased the length of Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to ensure her completion of RDAP, something a court may not do.

At sen-tencing, the District Court determined that the United States Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term of between 41 and 51 months for Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s offenses.  The court decided to impose a 51-month term, followed by three years of supervised release.  In explaining its reasons, the court referred several times to Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s need for drug treatment, citing in particular the Bureau of Prison\xe2\x80\x99s Residential Drug Abuse Program (known as RDAP or the 500 Hour Drug Program).  The court indicated that Tapia should serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and complete that program: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed correctional treatment, and here I think the needed correctional treatment is the 500 Hour Drug Program.</p>\n<p>\n\n.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I have to say that one of the factors that\xe2\x80\x94I am going to impose a 51-month sentence, \xe2\x80\xa6 and one of the factors that affects this is the need to provide treatment.

Appx. 707 (2010), relying on its prior decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Duran</em>, 37 F.\xc2\xa03d 557 (1994).  The Ninth Circuit had held there that \xc2\xa73582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term of imprisonment and determining its length.  See <em>id.,</em> at 561.  According to <em>Duran</em>, a sentencing court cannot impose a prison term to assist a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d the court may consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s need for rehabilitation in setting the length of the sentence.  <em>Ibid. </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to consider whether \xc2\xa73582(a) permits a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation. 562 U.

Aficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize much of the story line.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFor almost a century, the Federal Government employed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/361/index.html">488 U. S. 361</a>, 363 (1989).  Within \xe2\x80\x9ccustomarily wide\xe2\x80\x9d outer boundaries set by Congress, trial judges exercised \xe2\x80\x9calmost unfettered discretion\xe2\x80\x9d to select prison sentences for federal offenders.  <em>Id.</em>, at 364.  In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison time altogether, by imposing a \xe2\x80\x9csuspended\xe2\x80\x9d sentence.  If the judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary authority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant had spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order his release.  See K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18\xe2\x80\x9320 (1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation.  Discretion allowed \xe2\x80\x9cthe judge and the parole officer to [base] their respective sentencing and release decisions upon their own assessments of the offender\xe2\x80\x99s amenability to rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 363.  A convict, the theory went, should generally remain in prison only until he was able to reenter society safely.  His release therefore often coincided with \xe2\x80\x9cthe successful completion of certain vocational, educational, and counseling programs within the prisons.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p. 40 (1983) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.).  At that point, parole officials could \xe2\x80\x9cdetermin[e] that [the] prisoner had become rehabilitated and should be released from confinement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stith &amp; Cabranes, <em>supra</em>, at 18.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this model of indeterminate sentencing eventually fell into disfavor.  One concern was that it produced \xe2\x80\x9c[s]eri-ous disparities in [the] sentences\xe2\x80\x9d imposed on simi-\nlarly situated defendants.  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 365.  Another was that the system\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve rehabilitation of offenders had failed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 366.  Lawmakers and others increasingly doubted that prison programs could \xe2\x80\x9crehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or that parole officers could \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine accurately whether or when a particular prisoner ha[d] been rehabilitated.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 40.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul federal sentencing practices.  The Act abandoned indeterminate sentencing and parole in favor of a system in which Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing Commission, would provide courts with \xe2\x80\x9ca range of determinate sentences for categories of offenses and defendants.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 368.  And the Act further channeled judges\xe2\x80\x99 discretion by establishing a framework to govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender must impose at least one of the following sanctions: imprisonment (often followed by supervised release), probation, or a fine.  See \xc2\xa73551(b).  In determining the appropriate sentence from among these options, \xc2\xa73553(a)(2) requires the judge to consider specified factors, including:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe need for the sentence imposed\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese four considerations\xe2\x80\x94retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94are the four purposes of sentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve the[se] purposes \xe2\x80\xa6 to the extent that they are applicable\xe2\x80\x9d in a given case.  \xc2\xa73551(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SRA then provides additional guidance about how the considerations listed in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2) pertain to each of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s main sentencing options\xe2\x80\x94imprisonment, supervised release, probation, and fines.  See \xc2\xa73582(a); \xc2\xa73583; \xc2\xa73562(a); \xc2\xa73572(a).  These provisions make clear that a particular purpose may apply differently, or even not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.  For example, a court may <em>not </em>take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release.  See \xc2\xa73583(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the \xe2\x80\x9cfactors to be considered\xe2\x80\x9d when a court orders imprisonment.  That section provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe court, in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is \nto be imposed, in determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nA similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission in its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines.  The SRA instructs the Commission to:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cinsure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.

As just noted, that section instructs courts to \xe2\x80\x9crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  A common\xe2\x80\x94and in context the most natural\xe2\x80\x94definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9crecognize\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cto ac-knowledge or treat as valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1611 (2d ed. 1987).

Putting these two definitions together, \xc2\xa73582(a) tells courts that they should acknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation.  And when should courts acknowledge this?  Section \xc2\xa73582(a) answers: when \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [when] determining the length of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d  So a court making these decisions should consider the specified rationales of \npunishment <em>except for </em>rehabilitation, which it should ac-knowledge as an unsuitable justification for a prison term.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As against this understanding, <em>amicus</em> argues that \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause is not a flat prohibition \nbut only a \xe2\x80\x9creminder\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cguide [for] sentencing judges\xe2\x80\x99 cognitive processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in Support of Judgment Below 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (hereinafter <em>Amicus</em> Brief) (emphasis deleted).  <em>Amicus </em>supports this view by offering a string of other definitions of the \nword \xe2\x80\x9crecognize\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recall to mind,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98realize,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98perceive clearly.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 24 (quoting dictionary definitions).  Once these are plugged in, <em>amicus</em> suggests, \xc2\xa73582(a) reveals itself as a kind of loosey-goosey caution not to put <em>too </em>much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we do not see how these alternative meanings of \xe2\x80\x9crecognize\xe2\x80\x9d help <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99s cause.

Ditto for a judge who \xe2\x80\x9crealizes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crecalls\xe2\x80\x9d that imprisonment is not a way to rehabilitate an offender.  To be sure, the drafters of the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause could have used still more commanding language: Congress could have inserted a \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt not\xe2\x80\x9d or equivalent phrase to convey that a sentencing judge may never, ever, under any circumstances consider rehabilitation in imposing a prison term.  But when we interpret a statute, we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the merely excellent.  Congress expressed itself clearly in \xc2\xa73582(a), even if armchair legislators might come up with something even better.  And what Congress said was that when sentencing an offender to prison, the court shall consider all the purposes of punishment except rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94because imprisonment is not an appropriate means of pursuing that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Amicus</em> also claims, echoing the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Duran</em>, that \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause bars courts from considering rehabilitation only when imposing a prison term, and not when deciding on its length.  The argument goes as follows.  Section 3582(a) refers to two decisions: \xe2\x80\x9cThe court, [1] in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [2] in determining the length of the term\xe2\x80\x9d must consider the purposes of punishment listed \nin \xc2\xa73553(a)(2), subject to the caveat of the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  But that clause says only that \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d is not an appropriate means of rehabilitation.  Because the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary meaning of \xe2\x80\x98imprisonment\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98the act of confining a person,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>amicus </em>argues, the clause relates only to [1]\xc2\xa0the decision to incarcerate, and not to [2] the separate determination of the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s length.  <em>Amicus</em> Brief 52.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We again disagree.  Under standard rules of grammar, \xc2\xa73582(a) says: A sentencing judge shall recognize that imprisonment is not appropriate to promote rehabilita-tion when the court considers the applicable factors of \xc2\xa73553(a)(2); and a court considers these factors when determining <em>both </em>whether to imprison an offender <em>and</em> what length of term to give him.  The use of the \nword \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause does not destroy\xe2\x80\x94but instead fits neatly into\xe2\x80\x94this construction.  \xe2\x80\x9cImprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the clause most naturally means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he state of being confined\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca period of confinement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1137 (1993) (the \xe2\x80\x9cstate of being imprisoned\xe2\x80\x9d).  So the word does not distinguish between the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial placement behind bars and his continued stay there.  As the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit noted in rejecting an identical argument, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] sentencing court deciding to keep a defendant locked up for an additional month is, as to that month, in fact choosing imprisonment over release.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Sealed Case</em>, 573 F.\xc2\xa03d 844, 850 (2009).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Accordingly, the word \xe2\x80\x9cimprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d does not change the function of the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x94to constrain a sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s decision both to impose and to lengthen a prison term.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The context of \xc2\xa73582(a) puts an exclamation point on this textual conclusion.  As noted earlier, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 6, another provision of the SRA restates \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s message, but to a different audience.  That provision, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(k), directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9creflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this way, Congress ensured that all sentencing officials would work \nin tandem to implement the statutory determination to \xe2\x80\x9crejec[t] imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mistretta</em>, 488 U. S., at 367 (citing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(k)).  Section 994(k) bars the Commission from recommending a \xe2\x80\x9cterm of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a phrase that again refers both to the fact and to the length of incarceration\xe2\x80\x94based on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitative needs.  And \xc2\xa73582(a) prohibits a court from considering those needs to impose or lengthen a period of confinement when selecting a sentence from within, or choosing to depart from, the Guidelines range.  Each actor at each stage in the sentencing process receives the same message: Do not think about prison as a way to rehabilitate an offender.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally illuminating here is a statutory silence\xe2\x80\x94the absence of any provision granting courts the power to ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.  For when Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave courts \nthe authority to direct appropriate treatment for offenders.  Thus, the SRA instructs courts, in deciding whether to impose probation or supervised release, to consider whether an offender could benefit from training and treatment programs.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73562(a); \xc2\xa73583(c).  And so the SRA <em>also</em> authorizes courts, when imposing those sentences, to order an offender\xe2\x80\x99s participation in cer-\ntain programs and facilities.  \xc2\xa73563(b)(9); \xc2\xa73563(b)(11); \xc2\xa73563(a)(4); \xc2\xa73583(d).  As a condition of probation, for example, the court may require the offender to \xe2\x80\x9cundergo available medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as specified by the court, and [to] remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73563(b)(9).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If Congress had similarly meant to allow courts to base prison terms on offenders\xe2\x80\x99 rehabilitative needs, it would have given courts the capacity to ensure that offenders participate in prison correctional programs.  But in fact, courts do not have this authority.  When a court sentences a federal offender, the BOP has plenary control, subject to statutory constraints, over \xe2\x80\x9cthe place of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73621(b), and the treatment programs (if any) in which he may participate, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73621(e), (f); \xc2\xa73624(f).  See also 28 CFR pt. 544 (2010) (BOP regulations for administering inmate educational, recreational, and vocational programs); 28 CFR pt. 550, subpart F (drug abuse treatment programs).  A sentencing court can <em>recommend </em>that the BOP place an offender in a particular facility \nor program.  See \xc2\xa73582(a).  But decisionmaking authority rests with the BOP.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case well illustrates the point.  As noted earlier, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly recommend[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d that Tapia participate in RDAP, App. 29, and serve her sentence at FCI Dublin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere they have the facilities to really help her,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 28.  But the court\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations were only recommendations\xe2\x80\x94and in the end they had no effect.  See <em>Amicus</em> Brief 42 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Tapia] was not admitted to RDAP, nor even placed in the prison recommended by the district court\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief for United States 8, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to BOP records, [Tapia] was encouraged to enroll [in RDAP] during her psychology intake screening at [the federal prison], but she stated that she was not interested, and she has not volunteered for the program\xe2\x80\x9d).  The sentencing court may have had plans for Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation, but it lacked the power to implement them.  That incapacity speaks volumes.  It indicates that Congress did not intend that courts consider offenders\xe2\x80\x99 rehabilitative needs when imposing prison sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one last piece of corroborating evidence.  According to that Report, decades of experience with indeterminate sentencing, resulting in the release of many inmates after they completed correctional programs, had left Congress skeptical that \xe2\x80\x9crehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 38.  Although some critics argued that \xe2\x80\x9crehabilitation should be eliminated completely as a purpose of sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress declined to adopt that categorical position.  <em>Id.</em>, at 76.  Instead, the Report explains, Congress barred courts from considering rehabilitation in imposing prison terms, <em>ibid.</em>, and n.\xc2\xa0165, but not in ordering other kinds of sentences, <em>ibid.</em>, and n.\xc2\xa0164.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Report stated, \xe2\x80\x9cis still important in determining whether a sanction <em>other than a term of imprisonment</em> is appropriate in a particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 76\xe2\x80\x9377 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so this is a case in which text, context, and history point to the same bottom line: Section 3582(a) precludes sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison term to promote an offender\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked against him, <em>amicus </em>understandably tries to put the SRA\xe2\x80\x99s view of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame.  <em>Amicus</em> begins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA, rejected the old \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Amicus</em> Brief 1.  But according to <em>amicus</em>, that model had a very limited focus: It was the belief that \xe2\x80\x9cisolation and prison routine\xe2\x80\x9d could alone produce \xe2\x80\x9cpenitence and spiritual renewal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1, 11.  What the rehabilitation model did <em>not </em>include\xe2\x80\x94and the SRA therefore did not reject\xe2\x80\x94was prison treatment programs (including for drug addiction) targeted to offenders\xe2\x80\x99 particular needs.  See <em>id.</em>, at 21, 25, 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  So even after the passage of \xc2\xa73582(a), <em>amicus </em>argues, a court may impose or lengthen a prison sentence to promote an offender\xe2\x80\x99s participation in a targeted treatment program.  The only thing the court may not do is to impose a prison term on the ground that confinement itself\xe2\x80\x94its inherent solitude and routine\xe2\x80\x94will lead to rehabilitation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think this reading of the SRA is too narrow.  For one thing, the relevant history shows that at the time of \nthe SRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, prison rehabilitation efforts focused on treatment, counseling, and training programs, not on seclusion and regimentation.  See Rotman, The Failure of Reform: United States, 1865\xe2\x80\x931965, in Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society 169, 189\xe2\x80\x93190 (N. Morris &amp; D. Rothman eds. 1995) (describing the pre-SRA \xe2\x80\x9ctherapeutic model of rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x9d as characterized by \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized treatment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvocational training and group counseling programs\xe2\x80\x9d); see also n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra</em> (noting pre-SRA statutes linking the confinement of drug addicts to the completion of treatment programs).  Indeed, Congress had in mind precisely these programs when it prohibited consideration of rehabilitation in imposing a prison term.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(k) (instructing the Sentencing Commission to prevent the use of imprisonment to \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[e] the defendant with needed educational or vocational training \xe2\x80\xa6 or other correctional treatment\xe2\x80\x9d); S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 40 (rejecting the \xe2\x80\x9cmodel of \xe2\x80\x98coercive\xe2\x80\x99 rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x94the theory of correction that ties prison release dates to the successful completion of certain vocational, educational, and counseling programs within the prisons\xe2\x80\x9d).  Far from falling outside the \xe2\x80\x9crehabilitation model,\xe2\x80\x9d these programs practically defined it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is hardly surprising, then, that <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99s argument finds little support in the statutory text.  Read most naturally, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting correction and rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x9d covers efforts to place offenders in rehabilitation programs.  Indeed, \xc2\xa73582(a)\xe2\x80\x99s lan-guage recalls the SRA\xe2\x80\x99s description of the rehabilitative purpose of sentencing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(D).  That description makes clear that, under the SRA, treatment, training, and like programs are rehabilitation\xe2\x80\x99s sum and substance.  So <em>amicus</em>\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to exclude rehabilitation programs from the \xe2\x80\x9crecognizing\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x99s reach do not succeed.  That section prevents a sentencing court from imposing or lengthening a prison term because the court thinks an offender will benefit from a prison treatment program.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the sentencing transcript suggests the possibility that Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was based on her rehabilitative needs.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We note first what we do <em>not</em> disapprove about Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing.  A court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs.  To the contrary, a court properly may address a person who is about to begin a prison term about these important matters.  And as noted earlier, a court may urge the BOP to place an offender in a prison treatment program.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11.  Section 3582(a) itself provides, just after the clause at issue here, that a court may \xe2\x80\x9cmake a recommendation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate for the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d; and in this calculus, the presence of a rehabilitation program may make one facility more appropriate than another.  So the sentencing court here did nothing wrong\xe2\x80\x94and probably something very right\xe2\x80\x94in trying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment \nprogram.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the record indicates that the court may have done more\xe2\x80\x94that it may have selected the length of the sentence to ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug Program.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe sentence has to be sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cto provide needed correctional treatment, and here I think the needed correctional treatment is the \n500 Hour Drug Program.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 27; see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Or again: The \xe2\x80\x9cnumber one\xe2\x80\x9d thing \xe2\x80\x9cis the need to provide treatment.  In other words, so she is in long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 27; see <em>supra</em>, at 2<em>.</em>  These statements suggest that the court may have calculated the length of Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to ensure that she receive certain rehabilitative services.  And that a sentencing court may not do.  As we have held, a court may not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Consistent with our practice, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Marcus</em>, 560 U.

Third, he noted that the offense was \n\xe2\x80\x9cserious,\xe2\x80\x9d warranting a \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 26; see \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(A).  Fourth, he considered the need \xe2\x80\x9cto deter criminal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d which he characterized as a \xe2\x80\x9cbig factor here, given [Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s] failure to appear and what she did out on bail.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 26; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B), (C).  Fifth, he took account of the need \xe2\x80\x9cto provide needed correctional treatment,\xe2\x80\x9d in this case, the Bureau of Prisons\xe2\x80\x99 (BOP) \xe2\x80\x9c500 Hour Drug Program,\xe2\x80\x9d more officially called the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP).  App. 27; see \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(D).  And, finally, he noted the need \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities\xe2\x80\x9d and the need for the sentence \xe2\x80\x9cto be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a) but not greater.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 27; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a), (a)(6).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36 months\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration, App. 18, but her Guidelines range was 41 to 51 months, <em>id.</em>, at 13.  After reviewing the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51 months, the top of the Guidelines range.  He offered two reasons for choosing this sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cnumber one,\xe2\x80\x9d the need for drug treatment; and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]umber two,\xe2\x80\x9d deterrence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 27.  With respect to the latter reason, the judge highlighted Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history and her criminal conduct while released on bail\xe2\x80\x94which, he said, was \xe2\x80\x9csomething that motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the high end of the guideline range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  He concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that a sentence less than what I am imposing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time so she could begin to address these problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s comments at sentencing suggest that he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in further criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51 months\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration.  Granted, the judge also mentioned the need to provide drug treatment through the RDAP.  The 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to have had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP.  See BOP Program Statement No. P5330.11, \xc2\xa72.5.1(b) (Mar. 16, 2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an inmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining on her sentence).  Even the 36-month mandatory minimum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the RDAP.  I thus find it questionable that the judge lengthened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for deterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was necessary for rehabilitation.  Cf. S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 98\xe2\x80\x93225, p.\xc2\xa0176 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cA term imposed for another purpose of sentencing may \xe2\x80\xa6 have a rehabilitative focus if rehabil-itation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose of the sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District Judge imposed or lengthened Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to promote rehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sentencing were not perfectly clear.  Given that Ninth Circuit precedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to consider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see <em>ante</em>, at 2, and that the judge stated that the sentence needed to be \xe2\x80\x9clong enough to get the 500 Hour Drug \nProgram,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not lengthen Tapia\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to promote rehabilitation in violation of \xc2\xa73582(a).  I therefore agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of this case and join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
