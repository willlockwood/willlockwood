Along with nearly every other nude dancer in the metropolitan area, petitioner was arrested in one of two "sweep" operations conducted in February 1984. At a bench trial, an undercover police officer testified that once during her dance, petitioner touched her breasts, and then touched the inside of her thighs. At no time did petitioner expose her vaginal area or touch her genitals.

New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, supra, 452 U.S., at 718; California v. LaRue, supra, 409 U.S., at 118. Indeed, in Schad v. Mount Ephraim, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/61/case.html#66">452 U.S. 61, 66</a>, 2181d 671 (1981), the Court expressly stated that "nude dancing is not without its First Amendment protections from official regulation." See also Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/922/case.html">422 U.S. 922</a>, 933-934, 2568- 69 (1975); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.

Section 41-1812 does not prohibit nudity only in establishments possessing liquor licenses. Instead, it criminalizes nonobscene nudity in any public place so long as its purpose is to gratify the sexual desires of another person. Arkansas thus cannot rely on the Twenty-first Amendment as a sufficient basis to justify its statute, and instead, must demonstrate a compelling state interest sufficient to prohibit the exercise of a protected form of expression. See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., supra, 422 U.S., at 933-934-69; United States v. O\'Brien, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/case.html#377">391 U.S. 367, 377</a>, 1679 (1968). </p><p> In his dissent in New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, supra, Justice STEVENS noted that "[a]lthough the Court has written several opinions implying that nude or partially nude dancing is a form of expressive activity protected by the First Amendment, the Court has never directly confronted the question." Id., 452 U.S., at 718-719. I believe it is time to do so. The state courts are in disagreement over the reach of the First Amendment in this area. See generally Barbre, Topless or Bottomless Dancing or Similar Conduct as Offense, 49 A.L.R.3d 1084, 3, 5 (1973 and Supp.1985) (collecting cases ). In addition, this case does not present the complications of local police power over zoning, as found in Schad v. Mount Ephraim, supra, or the question of States\' rights under the Twenty-first Amendment present in California v. LaRue, supra, Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., supra, and New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, supra. </p><p> For these reasons, I would grant the petition for certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Arkansas Stat.Ann. 41-1812 (1977) provides in full as follows:</p><ul>"Indecent exposure.
