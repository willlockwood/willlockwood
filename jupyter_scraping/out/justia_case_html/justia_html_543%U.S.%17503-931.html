NIXON<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">FLORIDA <em>v.</em> NIXON</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the supreme court of florida</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93931.Argued November 2, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 13, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Nixon was arrested for a brutal murder.  Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped and killed his victim.  After gathering overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the State indicted Nixon for first-degree murder and related crimes.  Assistant public defender Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, filed a plea of not guilty and deposed all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s potential witnesses.  Satisfied that Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt was not subject to reasonable dispute, Corin commenced plea negotiations, but the prosecutors refused to recommend a sentence other than death.  Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, and a strong case for the prosecution, Corin concluded that his best course would be to concede Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, thereby preserving credibility for penalty phase evidence of Nixon\'s mental instability, and for defense pleas to spare Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s life.  Corin several times attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon, but Nixon remained unresponsive, never verbally approving or protesting the proposed strategy.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When trial began, Nixon engaged in disruptive behavior and absented himself from most of the proceedings.  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.  During the State\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief, Corin objected to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, cross-examined witnesses for clarification, and contested several aspects of the jury instructions.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, declaring that he hoped to persuade the jury during the penalty phase that Nixon should not be sentenced to death.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.  At the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Nixon was not \xe2\x80\x9can intact human being\xe2\x80\x9d and had committed the murder while afflicted with multiple mental disabilities.  Corin called as witnesses relatives and friends who described Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior preceding the murder.  Corin also presented expert testimony concerning Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s antisocial personality, history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, low IQ, and possible brain damage.  In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances; urged that, if not sentenced to death, Nixon would never be released; maintained that the death penalty was not appropriate for a person with Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s impairments; and asked the jury to spare Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s life.  The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, the death penalty.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court ultimately reversed, holding that a defense attorney\xe2\x80\x99s concession that his client committed murder, made without the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s express consent, automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial under the standard announced in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cronic,</em> 466 U. S.648.  Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession, according to that court, was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea in that it allowed the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s guilt-phase case to proceed essentially without opposition.  Under <em>Boykin</em> v. <em>Alabama,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/238/index.html">395 U. S. 238</a>, 242\xe2\x80\x93243, consent to a guilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; similarly, the Florida court stated, a concession of guilt at trial requires a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative, explicit acceptance, without which counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance is presumably inadequate.  While acknowledging that Nixon was very disruptive and uncooperative at trial and that Corin\xe2\x80\x99s strategy may have been in Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s best interest, the court nevertheless declared that silent acquiescence is not enough: Counsel conceding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt is inevitably ineffective if the defendant does not expressly approve counsel\xe2\x80\x99s course.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to obtain the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s express consent to a strategy of conceding guilt in a capital trial does not automatically render counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance deficient.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court erred in requiring Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative, explicit acceptance of Corin\xe2\x80\x99s strategy because it mistakenly deemed Corin\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the jury the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  Despite Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession of Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 242\xe2\x80\x93243, and n.\xc2\xa04.  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  Futhermore, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to appeal.  Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin\xe2\x80\x99s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness should not be evaluated under the <em>Cronic</em> standard, but under the standard prescribed in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 688: Did counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation \xe2\x80\x9cf[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?\xe2\x80\x9d  The Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous equation of Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that <em>Cronic </em>reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the client\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, 466 U. S., at 659.  Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession of Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt does not rank as such a failure.  <em>Id.,</em> at 666.<em> </em> Although a concession of guilt in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding\xe2\x80\x99s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies:\xc2\xa0Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase, at which time counsel\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to persuade the trier that his client\xe2\x80\x99s life should be spared.  Defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  Mounting a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant did not commit the crime\xe2\x80\x9d defense risks destroying counsel\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase credibility and may incline the jury against leniency for the defendant.  In a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, satisfies the <em>Strickland</em> standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s express consent\xe2\x80\x94however gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guilt\xe2\x80\x94automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 688 (1984).  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation \xe2\x80\x9cf[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Id.,</em> at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cronic</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/648/index.html">466 U. S. 648</a>, 659 (1984).  A presumption of prejudice is not in order based solely on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide express consent to a tenable strategy counsel has adequately disclosed to and discussed with the defendant.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Monday, August 13, 1984, near a dirt road in the environs of Tallahassee, Florida, a passing motorist discovered Jeanne Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s charred body.  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 572 So.\xc2\xa02d 1336, 1337 (Fla. 1990) <em>(Nixon I)</em>; 13 Record 2464\xe2\x80\x932466.  Bickner had been tied to a tree and set on fire while still alive.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2475, 2483\xe2\x80\x932484.  Her left leg and arm, and most of her hair and skin, had been burned away.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2475\xe2\x80\x932476.  The next day, police found Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s car, abandoned on a Tallahassee street corner, on fire.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2520.  Police arrested 23-year-old Joe Elton Nixon later that morning, after Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s brother informed the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office that Nixon had confessed to the murder.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2559.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped Bickner, then killed her.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He recounted that he had approached Bickner, a stranger, in a mall, and asked her to help him jump-start his car.  5 <em>id.,</em> at 919\xe2\x80\x93921.  Bickner offered Nixon a ride home in her 1973 MG sports car.  <em>Id</em>., at 922.  Once on the road, Nixon directed Bickner to drive to a remote place; en route, he overpowered her and stopped the car.  <em>Id.,</em> at 924, 926\xe2\x80\x93927.  Nixon next put Bickner in the MG\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, drove into a wooded area, removed Bickner from the car, and tied her to a tree with jumper cables.  <em>Id.,</em> at 930\xe2\x80\x93931.  Bickner pleaded with Nixon to release her, offering him money in exchange.  <em>Id.</em>, at 928.  Concerned that Bickner might identify him, Nixon decided to kill her.  <em>Id.,</em> at 929.  He set fire to Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s personal belongings and ignited her with burning objects.  <em>Id.,</em> at 934\xe2\x80\x93935.  Nixon drove away in the MG, and later told his brother and girlfriend what he had done.  <em>Id.,</em> at 938, 961.  He burned the MG on Tuesday, August 14, after reading in the newspaper that Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s body had been discovered.  <em>Id.,</em> at 963, 982.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.  A witness saw Nixon approach Bickner in the mall\xe2\x80\x99s parking lot on August 12, and observed Bickner taking jumper cables out of the trunk of her car and giving them to Nixon.  13 <em>id.,</em> at 2447\xe2\x80\x932448, 2450.  Several witnesses told police they saw Nixon driving around in the MG in the hours and days following Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s death.  See<em> id.,</em> at 2456, 2487\xe2\x80\x932488; 2498; 2509.  Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s palm print was found on the trunk of the car.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2548\xe2\x80\x932549.  Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, Wanda Robinson, and his brother, John Nixon, both stated that Nixon told them he had killed someone and showed them two rings later identified as Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s.  5 <em>id.,</em> at 971, 987; 13 <em>id.,</em> at 2565.  According to Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Nixon pawned the rings, 5 <em>id.,</em> at 986, and attempted to sell the car, <em>id.,</em> at 973.  At a local pawnshop, police recovered the rings and a receipt for them bearing Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s driver\xe2\x80\x99s license number; the pawnshop owner identified Nixon as the person who sold the rings to him.  13 <em>id.,</em> at 2568\xe2\x80\x932569.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see <em>id.,</em> at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, <em>id.,</em> at 468\xe2\x80\x93469, and deposed all of the State\xe2\x80\x99s potential witnesses, <em>id.,</em> at 53\xe2\x80\x9358.  Corin concluded, given the strength of the evidence, that Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt was not \xe2\x80\x9csubject to any reasonable dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 490.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilty pleas to all charges.  <em>Id.,</em> at 336\xe2\x80\x93338; 507.  Negotiations broke down when the prosecutors indicated their unwillingness to recommend a sentence other than death.  See <em>id.,</em> at 339, 508.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s mental instability.  <em>Id.,</em> at 261, 473; see also <em>id.</em>, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see <em>id.,</em> at 248\xe2\x80\x93250, Corin feared that denying Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corin\xe2\x80\x99s ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See <em>id.,</em> at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.  <em>Id.,</em> at 458, 505.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.  <em>Id.,</em> at 254\xe2\x80\x93255.  Although Corin had represented Nixon previously on unrelated charges and the two had a good relationship in Corin\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, see <em>id.,</em> at 466\xe2\x80\x93467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions, <em>id.,</em> at 478\xe2\x80\x93480.  He never verbally approved or protested Corin\xe2\x80\x99s proposed strategy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 234\xe2\x80\x93238; 255; 501.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case, <em>id.,</em> at 478, and refused to attend pretrial dispositions of various motions, <em>Nixon I</em>, 572 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1341; App.<em> </em>478.  Corin eventually exercised his professional judgment to pursue the concession strategy.  As he explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are many times lawyers make decisions because they have to make them because the client does nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 486.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  <em>Nixon I</em>, 572 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1341; 10 Record 1934\xe2\x80\x931935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1918\xe2\x80\x931920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1926\xe2\x80\x931931.  The judge ruled that Nixon had intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1938; 11 <em>id.,</em> at 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The guilt phase of the trial thus began in Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s absence.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn this case, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis case is about the death of Joe Elton Nixon and whether it should occur within the next few years by electrocution or maybe its natural expiration after a lifetime of confinement.</p>\n<p align="left">.....</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNow, in arriving at your verdict, in your penalty recommendation, for we will get that far, you are going to learn many facts \xe2\x80\xa6 about Joe Elton Nixon.  Some of those facts are going to be good.  That may not seem clear to you at this time.  But, and sadly, most of the things you learn of Joe Elton Nixon are not going to be good.  But, I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting to you that when you have seen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and the evidence that has been shown, there are going to be reasons why you should recommend that his life be spared.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 71\xe2\x80\x9372.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner\xe2\x80\x99s car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20 <em>id.,</em> at 3741.  Corin did object to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, 13 <em>id.,</em> at 2470, and actively contested several aspects of the jury instructions during the charge conference, 11 <em>id.,</em> at 2050\xe2\x80\x932058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: \xe2\x80\x9cI will hope to \xe2\x80\xa6 argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 74.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the start of the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that \xe2\x80\x9cJoe Elton Nixon is not normal organically, intellectually, emotionally or educationally or in any other way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 102.  Corin presented the testimony of eight witnesses.  Relatives and friends described Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior in the days preceding the murder.

That obligation, however, does not require counsel to obtain the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s consent to \xe2\x80\x9cevery tactical decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/400/index.html">484 U.

But certain decisions regarding the exercise or waiver of basic trial rights are of such moment that they cannot be made for the defendant by a surrogate.  A defendant, this Court affirmed, has \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate authority\xe2\x80\x9d to determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Barnes,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/745/index.html">463 U.

Concerning those decisions, an attorney must both consult with the defendant and obtain consent to the recommended course of action.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A guilty plea, we recognized in <em>Boykin </em>v.<em> Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/238/index.html">395 U. S. 238</a> (1969), is an event of signal significance in a criminal proceeding.  By entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives constitutional rights that inhere in a criminal trial, including the right to trial by jury, the protection against self-incrimination, and the right to confront one\xe2\x80\x99s accusers.  <em>Id.,</em> at 243.  While a guilty plea may be tactically advantageous for the defendant, <em>id.,</em> at 240, the plea is not simply a strategic choice; it is \xe2\x80\x9citself a conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 242, and the high stakes for the defendant require \xe2\x80\x9cthe utmost solicitude,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 243.  Accordingly, counsel lacks authority to consent to a guilty plea on a client\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, <em>Brookhart</em> v. <em>Janis,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/1/index.html">384 U. S. 1</a>, 6\xe2\x80\x937 (1966); moreover, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s tacit acquiescence in the decision to plead is insufficient to render the plea valid, <em>Boykin,</em> 395 U. S., at 242.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 9, required Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative, explicit acceptance\xe2\x80\x9d of Corin\xe2\x80\x99s strategy because it deemed Corin\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the jury \xe2\x80\x9cthe functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon II</em>, 758 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 624.  We disagree with that assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. <em>Boykin</em>, 395 U. S., at 242\xe2\x80\x93243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts,\xe2\x80\x9d it is a \xe2\x80\x9cstipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on <em>Brookhart</em> v.<em> Janis, </em>that this Court has already extended the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative, explicit acceptance\xe2\x80\x9d to proceedings \xe2\x80\x9csurrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s factual case on the issue of guilt or innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 32.  Defense counsel in <em>Brookhart </em>had agreed to a \xe2\x80\x9cprima facie\xe2\x80\x9d bench trial at which the State would be relieved of its obligation to put on \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete proof\xe2\x80\x9d of guilt or persuade a jury of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  384 U. S., at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  In contrast to <em>Brookhart</em>, there was in Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s case no \xe2\x80\x9ctruncated\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding, <em>id.</em>, at 6, shorn of the need to persuade the trier \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d and of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  While the \xe2\x80\x9cprima facie\xe2\x80\x9d trial in <em>Brookhart</em> was fairly characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cthe equivalent of a guilty plea,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 7, the full presentation to the jury in Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s case does not resemble that severely abbreviated proceeding.  <em>Brookhart</em>, in short, does not carry the weight Nixon would place on it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, 9.  Given Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see <em>Nixon III</em>, 857 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 187\xe2\x80\x93188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin\xe2\x80\x99s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous equation of Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cronic,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/648/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/648/index.html">466 U. S. 648</a> (1984), reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the client\xe2\x80\x99s advocate.  The Florida court therefore did not hold Nixon to the standard prescribed in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), which would have required Nixon to show that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s concession strategy was unreasonable.  As Florida Supreme Court Justice Lewis observed, that court\xe2\x80\x99s majority misunderstood <em>Cronic</em> and failed to attend to the realities of defending against a capital charge.  <em>Nixon III</em>, 857 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 180\xe2\x80\x93183 (opinion concurring in result).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cronic</em> recognized a narrow exception to <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.  <em>Cronic</em> instructed that a presumption of prejudice would be in order in \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 658.  The Court elaborated: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 659; see <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html">535 U. S. 685</a>, 696\xe2\x80\x93697 (2002) (for <em>Cronic</em>\xe2\x80\x99s presumed prejudice standard to apply, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure must be complete\xe2\x80\x9d).  We illustrated just how infrequently the \xe2\x80\x9csurrounding circumstances [will] justify a presumption of ineffectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Cronic </em>itself.  In that case, we reversed a Court of Appeals ruling that ranked as prejudicially inadequate the performance of an inexperienced, under-prepared attorney in a complex mail fraud trial.  466 U. S., at 662, 666.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the record thus far developed, Corin\xe2\x80\x99s concession of Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s guilt does not rank as a \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government\xe2\x80\x99s adversary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </em> Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding\xe2\x80\x99s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0L.

Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L.

Instead, if counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, satisfies the <em>Strickland</em> standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although Nixon initially stated that he kidnaped Bickner on August 11, the kidnaping and murder in fact occurred on Sunday, August 12, 1984.  20 Record 3768\xe2\x80\x933770.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Every court to consider this case, including the judge who presided over Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s trial, agreed with Corin\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the evidence.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Singletary</em>, 758 So.\xc2\xa02d 618, 625 (Fla. 2000) <em>(per curiam)</em> (evidence of guilt was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> State</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, Case No. 84\xe2\x80\x932324 (Fla. Cir.

See<em> Nixon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 572 So.\xc2\xa02d 1336, 1341\xe2\x80\x931342 (Fla. 1990); Brief for Petitioner 6, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Nixon contended in the alternative that Corin\xe2\x80\x99s decision to concede guilt was unreasonable and prejudicial under the generally applicable standard set out in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  App. 385, 389; see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Nixon also raised several other challenges to his conviction and sentence.  See App. 378\xe2\x80\x93384; 390\xe2\x80\x93392.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  See Brief for Respondent 13\xe2\x80\x9322.  Corin\xe2\x80\x99s failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured against the <em>Strickland</em> standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter in the first instance. </p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases \xc2\xa710.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client\xe2\x80\x99s trial rights.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 minds as they deliberate on the sentence.

Rev. 299, 331 (1983); <em>supra</em>, at 7, 11.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
