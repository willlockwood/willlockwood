The District Court refused to dismiss the petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\xe2\x80\x99s (AEDPA) statute of limitations, finding that petitioner was entitled to both statutory and equitable tolling while his PCRA petition was pending even though that petition was untimely under state law.  Reversing, the Third Circuit held, with regard to statutory tolling, that an untimely PCRA petition is not \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d that tolls AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), and that there were no extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Because petitioner filed his federal habeas petition beyond the deadline and is not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling for any of that time period, his federal petition is barred by AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Petitioner is not entitled to statutory tolling.  When this Court held in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a>, 8, 11, that time limits on postconviction petitions are \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] to filing,\xe2\x80\x9d such that an untimely petition would not be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d it reserved the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered improperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa02.  There are no grounds for treating the two differently.  Under the common understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d that guided the <em>Artuz </em>Court, a petition filed after a time limit, which does not fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d than a petition filed after a time limit permitting no exception.  This commonsense reading is confirmed by the purpose of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations and is supported by <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U. S. 214</a>.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counterarguments\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] to filing\xe2\x80\x9d are merely those conditions necessary to get a clerk to accept the petition, not conditions requiring judicial consideration; that a condition that must be applied on a claim-by-claim basis cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing\xe2\x80\x9d; and that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is unfair to petitioners who try in good faith to exhaust their state remedies\xe2\x80\x94are rejected.  <em>Artuz</em> does not require a different result.  There is an obvious distinction between time limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court\xe2\x80\x99 s ability to consider that petition, and the type of rule-of-decision procedural bars at issue in <em>Artuz,</em> which go to the ability to obtain relief.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Because petitioner waited for years after his claims became available to file his PCRA petition and five more months once his PCRA proceedings became final before seeking relief in federal court, he has not established that he pursued his claims diligently.  Thus, assuming equitable tolling applies here, he is not entitled to equitable tolling.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  That limitations period is tolled, however, while \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  This case requires us to decide whether a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely nonetheless is \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  We conclude that it is not, and hold that petitioner John Pace\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition is time barred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 1986, petitioner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in a Pennsylvania state court.  He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Petitioner did not file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and he did not file a direct appeal.  In August 1986, he filed a petition under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79541 <em>et seq</em>. (1988) (amended and renamed by Act No. 1988\xe2\x80\x9347, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73, 6, 1988 Pa. Laws pp. 337\xe2\x80\x93342).  These proceedings concluded in September 1992, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s untimely request for discretionary review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over four years later, on November 27, 1996, petitioner filed another state postconviction petition, this time under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79541 <em>et seq</em>. (1998).  The PCRA had replaced the PCHA in 1988 and was amended in 1995 to include, for the first time, a statute of limitations for state postconviction petitions, with three exceptions.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Although petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition was filed after the date upon which the new time limits became effective, the petition said nothing about timeliness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reviewing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition, appointed counsel submitted a \xe2\x80\x9cno-merit\xe2\x80\x9d letter.  On July 23, 1997, the Court of Common Pleas dismissed the petition, without calling for a response from the Commonwealth.  The court noted that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claims previously had been litigated and were meritless.  Petitioner appealed.  On May 6, 1998, the Commonwealth filed a brief in response, asserting that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition was untimely under the PCRA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar, \xc2\xa79545(b), and citing as support <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alcorn</em>, 703 A.\xc2\xa02d 1054 (Pa. Super. 1997).  On May 28, 1998, petitioner responded by arguing that the time limit was inapplicable to him.  The Superior Court dismissed his petition as untimely on December 3, 1998.<font b="1">  The Superior Court reasoned that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition did not come within the statutory note following \xc2\xa79545(b), see <em>ibid</em>., and that petitioner had \xe2\x80\x9cneither alleged nor proven\xe2\x80\x9d that he fell within any statutory exception, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79545(b)(1)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(iii).  App. 316\xe2\x80\x93317.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review on July 29, 1999.  <em>Id.,</em> at 372.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 24, 1999, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the petition under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, \xc2\xa72244(d)(1), but the District Court rejected that recommendation, App. 447\xe2\x80\x93466 (June 7, 2001, memorandum and order), 503\xe2\x80\x93533 (Mar. 29, 2002, memorandum and order).  The District Court recognized that, without tolling, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s petition was time barred.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But it held that petitioner was entitled to both statutory and equitable tolling for the time during which his PCRA petition was pending\xe2\x80\x94November 27, 1996 to July 29, 1999.  Beginning with statutory tolling, the District Court held that, even though the state court rejected his PCRA petition as untimely, that did not prevent the petition from being \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  It reasoned that because the PCRA set up judicially reviewable exceptions to the time limit, the PCRA time limit was not a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing\xe2\x80\x9d but a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to obtaining relief\xe2\x80\x9d as we described those distinct concepts in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html">531 U. S. 4</a>, 11 (2000).  The District Court alternatively found extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.  <em>Pace</em> v. <em>Vaughn</em>, 71 Fed. Appx. 127 (2003) (not precedential).  With regard to <em>statutory</em> tolling, it relied on a line of Third Circuit cases to conclude that the PCRA time limit constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing\xe2\x80\x9d and that, when a state court deems a petition untimely, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 128.  With regard to <em>equitable</em> tolling, it held that there were not extraordinary circumstances justifying that remedy.  <em>Id.</em>, at 129.  Because Circuits have divided over whether a state postconviction petition that the state court has rejected as untimely nonetheless may be \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d we granted certiorari.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  542 U. S. \xe2\x80\x94 (2004).  We now affirm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett,</em> <em>supra</em>, we held that time limits on postconviction petitions are \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] to filing,\xe2\x80\x9d such that an untimely petition would not be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 8, 11 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n application is \xe2\x80\x98<em>properly</em> filed\xe2\x80\x99 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9ctime limits upon its delivery\xe2\x80\x9d).  However, we reserved the question we face here: \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered improperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 8, n.\xc2\xa02.  Having now considered the question, we see no grounds for treating the two differently.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Artuz</em>, we are guided by the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon usage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommo[n] underst[anding]\xe2\x80\x9d of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 8, 9.  In common understanding, a petition filed after a time limit, and which does not fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d than a petition filed after a time limit that permits no exception.  The purpose of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations confirms this commonsense reading.  On petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s theory, a state prisoner could toll the statute of limitations at will simply by filing untimely state postconviction petitions.  This would turn \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) into a <em>de facto</em> extension mechanism, quite contrary to the purpose of AEDPA, and open the door to abusive delay.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U. S. 214</a> (2002), points to the same conclusion.  In <em>Saffold</em>, we considered whether \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) required tolling during the 4<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2 months between the California appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Saffold\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction petition and his further petition in the California Supreme Court.  The California Supreme Court denied the petition \xe2\x80\x9con the merits and for lack of diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d which raised the question whether that court had dismissed for lack of merit, for untimeliness, or for both.  <em>Id.</em>, at 225 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although we ultimately remanded, we explained that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the California Supreme Court had clearly ruled that Saffold\xe2\x80\x99s 4<font super="1">1<font super="-1">2-month delay was \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> untimely, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>that would be the end of the matter</em>, regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim, or whether its timeliness ruling was \xe2\x80\x98entangled\xe2\x80\x99 with the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 226 (emphasis added); see also <em>id.</em>, at 236 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the California court held that all of [Saffold\xe2\x80\x99s] state habeas petitions were years overdue, then they were not \xe2\x80\x98properly filed\xe2\x80\x99 at all, and there would be no tolling of the federal limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d).  What we intimated in <em>Saffold</em> we now hold: When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, \xe2\x80\x9cthat [is] the end of the matter\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</font></font></font></font></p><font super="1"><font super="-1"><font super="1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner makes three principal arguments against this reading.  First, he asserts that \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] to filing\xe2\x80\x9d are merely those conditions necessary to get a clerk to accept the petition, as opposed to conditions that require some <em>judicial</em> consideration.  Respondent David DiGuglielmo (hereinafter respondent) characterizes petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s position, which the dissent also appears to embrace, see <em>post</em>, at 7, as a juridical game of \xe2\x80\x9chot potato,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a petition will be \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d so long as a petitioner is able to hand it to the clerk without the clerk tossing it back.  Brief for Respondent 16.  Be that as it may, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s theory is inconsistent with <em>Artuz</em>, where we explained that jurisdictional matters and fee payments, both of which often necessitate judicial scrutiny, are \xe2\x80\x9ccondition[s] to filing.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See 531 U. S., at 9.  We fail to see how timeliness is any less a \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d requirement than the mechanical rules that are enforceable by clerks, if such rules exist.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  For example, Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 901 (2005), which is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cInitiation of Post-Conviction Collateral Proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d lists two mandatory conditions: (A) the petition \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be filed within the time limit, and (B) the proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cshall be initiated by filing\xe2\x80\x9d a verified petition and \xe2\x80\x9c3 copies with the clerk of the court in which the defendant was convicted and sentenced.\xe2\x80\x9d  The natural reading is that (A) is every bit as much of a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing\xe2\x80\x9d as (B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner also argues that, because \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed <em>application</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d then any condition that must be applied on a claim-by-claim basis, such as Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s time limit, cannot be a \xe2\x80\x9ccondition to filing.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Section 2244, however, refutes this position.  Section 2244(b)(3)(C), for example, states that the court of appeals \xe2\x80\x9cmay authorize the filing of a second or successive <em>application</em> only if it determines that the <em>application</em> makes a prima facie showing that the <em>application</em> satisfies the requirements of this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphases added.)  Yet the \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d of the subsection are not applicable to the application as a whole; instead, they require inquiry into specific \xe2\x80\x9cclaim[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(A) (\xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d relies on a new rule made retroactive); \xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d with new factual predicate).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In fact, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is inconsistent with \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) itself, which refers not just to a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed application,\xe2\x80\x9d but to a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed application . . . <em>with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner challenges the fairness of our interpretation.  He claims that a \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner trying in good faith to exhaust state remedies may litigate in state court for years only to find out at the end that he was never \xe2\x80\x98properly filed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and thus that his federal habeas petition is time barred.  Brief for Petitioner 30.  A prisoner seeking state postconviction relief might avoid this predicament, however, by filing a \xe2\x80\x9cprotective\xe2\x80\x9d petition in federal court and asking the federal court to stay and abey the federal habeas proceedings until state remedies are exhausted.  See <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 8.  A petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable confusion about whether a state filing would be timely will ordinarily constitute \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause\xe2\x80\x9d for him to file in federal court.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory tactics,\xe2\x80\x9d then the district court likely \xe2\x80\x9cshould stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent suggests that our conclusion in <em>Artuz</em>, that state procedural bars \xe2\x80\x9cprescrib[ing] a rule of decision for a court\xe2\x80\x9d confronted with certain claims previously adjudicated or not properly presented are not \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d conditions, requires the conclusion that the time limit at issue here also is not a \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d condition.  <em>Post</em>, at 7; see <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, 531 U. S., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (discussing N.\xc2\xa0Y. Crim. Proc. Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994)).  The dissent ignores the fact that <em>Artuz</em> itself distinguished between time limits and procedural bars.  531 U. S., at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  For purposes of determining what are \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d conditions, there is an obvious distinction between time limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider that petition, and the type of \xe2\x80\x9crule of decision\xe2\x80\x9d procedural bars at issue in <em>Artuz</em>, which go to the ability to obtain relief.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Far from requiring \xe2\x80\x9cverbal gymnastics,\xe2\x80\x9d it must be the case that a petition that cannot even be initiated or considered due to the failure to include a timely claim is not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, we hold that time limits, no matter their form, are \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d conditions.  Because the state court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition as untimely, it was not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d and he is not entitled to statutory tolling under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now turn to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he is entitled to <em>equitable</em> tolling for the time during which his untimely PCRA petition was pending in the state courts.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 96 (1990).  Petitioner argues that he has satisfied the extraordinary circumstance test.  He reasons that Third Circuit law at the time he sought relief required him to exhaust his state remedies and thus seek PCRA relief, even if it was unlikely the state court would reach the merits of his claims, and that state law made it appear as though he might gain relief, despite the petition\xe2\x80\x99s untimeliness.  Thus, he claims, \xe2\x80\x9cstate law and Third Circuit exhaustion law created a trap\xe2\x80\x9d on which he detrimentally relied as his federal time limit slipped away.  Brief for Petitioner 34.  Even if we were to accept petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s theory, he would not be entitled to relief because he has not established the requisite diligence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition set forth three claims: that his sentence was \xe2\x80\x9cillegal\xe2\x80\x9d; that his plea was invalid because he did not understand his life sentence was without the possibility of parole; and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at \xe2\x80\x9call levels of representation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 202, 220.  The first two of these claims were available to petitioner as early as 1986.  Indeed, petitioner asserted a version of his invalid plea claim in his August 21, 1986, PCHA petition.  See <em>id.,</em> at 144.  The third claim\xe2\x80\x94ineffective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x94related only to events occurring in or before 1991.  See <em>id.,</em> at 191.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet petitioner waited years, without any valid justification, to assert these claims in his November 27, 1996, PCRA petition.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Had petitioner advanced his claims within a reasonable time of their availability, he would not now be facing any time problem, state or federal.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  And not only did petitioner sit on his rights for years <em>before</em> he filed his PCRA petition, but he also sat on them for five more months <em>after</em> his PCRA proceedings became final before deciding to seek relief in federal court.  See <em>id.,</em> at 372, 373.  Under long-established principles, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s lack of diligence precludes equity\xe2\x80\x99s operation.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) is not compelled by the text of that provision and will most assuredly frustrate its purpose.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The words \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed application for \xe2\x80\xa6 collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d are not defined in AEDPA.

Because applications and claims are distinct, we held that a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>application</em> for postconviction review is \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d even when his legal <em>claims</em> are procedurally barred under state law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Artuz</em> left open the question presented here\xe2\x80\x94whether a state statute of limitations that allows certain categories of petitioners to file otherwise late applications is comparable to a general precondition to filing (such as the payment of a filing fee) or is instead more akin to a procedural bar that prevents a court from considering particular claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa02.  If the state time bar at issue here is more like the former, Pace\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with it would make his application improperly filed under AEDPA.  If, however, the state time bar is more like the procedural bar in <em>Artuz</em>, Pace\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with it would not change the fact that his application was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Before answering that question, it is useful to explain why the state court ultimately found Pace\xe2\x80\x99s application to be untimely.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pace filed the application in question\xe2\x80\x94his second request for state postconviction review\xe2\x80\x94<em>pro se</em> on November 27, 1996, under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79541 <em>et seq</em>. (1998).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Pace\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition raised two claims that he alleged had not been presented during his first round of postconviction review: first, that his life-without-parole sentence was unconstitutional under state and federal law; and second, that his guilty plea colloquy violated due process.  Pace provided new evidence that he had not presented during his first round of postconviction review, see App. 191, 195\xe2\x80\x93201, and explained to the court that his two new claims should not be procedurally barred because they had not been \xe2\x80\x9cfully litigated or waived\xe2\x80\x9d under state law, <em>ibid.</em>  Pace\xe2\x80\x99s justifications for raising these two new claims make plain that he was attempting to fit his application within the commonly recognized judicial exceptions to Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s then-applicable state procedural bars.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time Pace filed his PCRA petition, no Pennsylvania court had yet applied the PCRA statute of limitations to a petitioner whose conviction had become final prior to the effective date of the Act.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Nor had the time in which Pace had a right to file a federal habeas petition expired.  Under AEDPA, Pace had until April 24, 1997, to file a federal habeas petition.  See <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/214/index.html">536 U. S. 214</a>, 217 (2002) (1-year limitations period runs from April 24, 1996, for any prisoner whose conviction became final prior to the effective date of the Act).  Pace could not, however, obtain relief in a federal court without first exhausting his state remedies.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A).  Thus, as far as Pace knew on November 27, 1996, there was no state or federal statute of limitations that precluded him from obtaining relief, but he was required (1) by AEDPA to go to state court and (2) by state law to demonstrate that his claim was not procedurally barred.  Unless Pace\xe2\x80\x99s PCRA petition tolled the federal statute of limitations, his claims would be time barred in federal court on April 24, 1997.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pace\xe2\x80\x99s petition was docketed and the court appointed counsel.  On July 23, 1997, the state trial court denied relief on the merits.  Pace appealed.  In May 1998, well after Pace\xe2\x80\x99s time to file a federal habeas petition had expired, the Commonwealth filed a brief in the state appellate court, which argued <em>for the first time</em> that Pace\xe2\x80\x99s petition was untimely under the PCRA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  On December 3, 1998, the state appellate court agreed, explaining that none of Pace\xe2\x80\x99s several claims fell within the three statutory exceptions to untimeliness contained in Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79545(b) (1998).  The state appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion became final on July 29, 1999.  It is that determination that provides the basis for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that, as a matter of federal law, the pleading that generated protracted litigation in the state courts was never \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d in the first place.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/4/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/4/index.html">531 U.

Furthermore:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIgnoring this distinction would require judges to engage in verbal gymnastics when an application contains some claims that are procedurally barred and some that are not.  Presumably a court would have to say that the application is \xe2\x80\x98properly filed\xe2\x80\x99 <em>as to </em>the nonbarred claims, and not \xe2\x80\x98properly filed\xe2\x80\x99 <em>as to </em>the rest.  The statute, however, \xe2\x80\xa6 does not contain the peculiar suggestion that a single application can be both \xe2\x80\x98properly filed\xe2\x80\x99 and not \xe2\x80\x98properly filed.\xe2\x80\x99  Ordinary English would refer to certain <em>claims </em>as having been properly <em>presented </em>or <em>raised</em>, irrespective of whether the application containing those claims was properly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same reasoning applies with equal force to the PCRA time bar, which in effect operates in the same manner as the procedural bar in <em>Artuz</em>.  Under the PCRA, the state court must determine not<em> </em>whether the entire application is time barred, but rather whether individual <em>claims </em>are time barred given the various exceptions enumerated in \xc2\xa79545(b).  See n.\xc2\xa03, <em>supra.</em>  Imagine, for example, a Pennsylvania petitioner who states two claims in what is his second state habeas petition.  The first claim asserts a violation of due process rights under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), in which the petitioner demonstrates that his failure to raise the claim during his first round of state postconviction review was \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79545(b)(1)(i) (1998).  The second claim asserts an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based on the same evidence raised in the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first PCRA application.  Under the rule announced by the Court today, a federal court would be forced to conclude that the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s first claim was a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed application for \xe2\x80\xa6 collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d for AEDPA purposes, while his second claim was improperly filed.  This is precisely the type of incoherent result that <em>Artuz</em> sought to avoid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Incoherent results will not be limited to petitions filed in Pennsylvania.  Many States provide exceptions from their postconviction statutes of limitations that apply to applicants\xe2\x80\x99 individual claims.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa712.72.020 (Lexis 2004) (exempting from the statute of limitations, <em>inter alia</em>, any <em>claims </em>\xe2\x80\x9cbased on newly discovered evidence\xe2\x80\x9d); Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.850 (2005 Supp. Pamphlet) (excepting from the general time bar any claim based on newly discovered evidence, newly recognized rights, or neglect of counsel); Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 725, \xc2\xa75/122\xe2\x80\x931(c) (West Supp. 2004) (allowing for late fillings when petitioner can show that delay was not due to negligence and excepting entirely from the limitations period any \xe2\x80\x9cclaim of actual innocence\xe2\x80\x9d); Iowa Code \xc2\xa7822.3 (2003) (exception for any \xe2\x80\x9cground of fact or law that could not have been raised within the applicable time period\xe2\x80\x9d); Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71089(D)(4)\xe2\x80\x93(8) (West Supp. 2005) (requiring the reviewing court to examine each claim and permitting late filing if any included claim could not have previously been presented on account of legal or factual unavailability).  For all applications originating in such States, federal district courts must now engage in the very \xe2\x80\x9cverbal gymnastics\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>Artuz </em>condemned.  See 531 U. S., at 10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d in this context conflicts with the meaning we gave the phrase in <em>Artuz</em>.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule suggests that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d takes on a different meaning when applied to time bars than it does in the context of procedural bars.  This Court has generally declined to adopt rules that would give the same statutory provision different meanings in different contexts, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez</em>, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 15), and I would decline to do so here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It would be much wiser simply to apply <em>Artuz</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule to state time bars that, like the PCRA, operate like a procedural bar.  In this case, the PCRA time bar\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated exceptions, which require state courts to review the claims elucidated in postconviction petitions and to determine whether particular claims trigger the applicability of the exceptions, plainly function like a procedural bar.  Thus, I would hold that Pace\xe2\x80\x99s petition was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was \xe2\x80\x9cdelivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record\xe2\x80\x9d and complied with the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable laws and rules governing filings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Artuz</em>, 531 U. S., at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of the <em>Artuz</em> rule in this context is clearly consonant with the statutory text.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A time bar is nothing more than a species of the larger category of procedural bars that may preclude consideration of the merits of the state petition, and may raise questions that are equally difficult to decide.  Indeed, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, the contention that a claim is untimely is an affirmative defense that can be waived.  Because most state laws respecting untimely filings of postconviction petitions function in a manner identical to the procedural bar at issue in <em>Artuz</em>, there is no justification for giving special treatment to any state rule based on untimeliness.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rule treating statutes of limitations equivalently to procedural bars would accomplish the statutory purposes Congress sought to vindicate in AEDPA.  Congress fashioned 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) in order to provide a strong \xe2\x80\x9cincentive for individuals to seek relief from the state courts before filing federal habeas petitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 180 (2001).  As we explained in <em>Duncan:</em> </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe tolling provision of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period.  Section 2244(d)(2) promotes the exhaustion of state remedies by protecting a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued.  At the same time, the provision limits the harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effect only to \xe2\x80\x98properly filed application[s] \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 179\xe2\x80\x93180.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn construing the words \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, we must consider not only the \xe2\x80\x9cpotential for delay in the adjudication of federal law claims,\xe2\x80\x9d but also the need to avoid overburdening district courts by encouraging \xe2\x80\x9cthe very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 180.  AEDPA, after all, was designed to \xe2\x80\x9cstreamline and simplify\xe2\x80\x9d the federal habeas system in order to reduce the \xe2\x80\x9cinterminable delays\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshameful overloading\xe2\x80\x9d that had resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cvarious aspects of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s habeas corpus jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hohn</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/236/index.html">524 U. S. 236</a>, 264\xe2\x80\x93265 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule is unfaithful to these legislative goals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s principal justification for its rule is the fear that allowing statutory tolling in this context would allow prisoners to extend the federal statute of limitations indefinitely by repeatedly filing meritless state petitions.  See <em>ante,</em> at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] state prisoner could toll the statute of limitations at will simply by filing untimely state postconviction petitions\xe2\x80\x9d).  That fear is misguided for two reasons.  First, it ignores a basic fact that we have recognized repeatedly\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s principal interest, of course, is in obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a>, 520 (1982).  Indeed, it is an understatement to say that the vast majority of federal prisoners \xe2\x80\x9chave no incentive to delay adjudication of their claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Duncan,</em> 533 U. S., at 191 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Most prisoners have precisely the opposite incentive because delaying the initiation of federal postconviction relief will almost assuredly maximize their periods of incarceration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern is premised on the incorrect assumption that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d has no meaningful content unless all untimely petitions are by definition improper.  The reason that assumption is wrong is because any claim that a state application has tolled the limitations period will always depend on the district court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the petition was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my view, it would be entirely appropriate, and consistent with the text and purposes of AEDPA, to define \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d as excluding any filings deemed by the district court to be repetitious or abusive.  If an application for postconviction review is not filed in good faith\xe2\x80\x94filed, in other words, explicitly to prolong the federal statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94it would be improper under AEDPA, and statutory tolling would not be appropriate.  Federal and state courts have considerable experience identifying and preventing the kind of dilatory pleadings that concern the Court today.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McCleskey</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/467/index.html">499 U. S. 467</a>, 479\xe2\x80\x93489 (1991).  There is no reason that courts could not engage in similar analyses to prevent state prisoners from prolonging indefinitely the AEDPA statute of limitations.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the most likely consequence of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rule will be to increase, not reduce, delays in the federal system.  The inevitable result of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be a flood of protective filings in the federal district courts.  As the history of this case demonstrates, litigants, especially those proceeding <em>pro se</em>, cannot predict accurately whether a state court will find their application timely filed.  Because a state court\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness ruling cannot be predicted with certainty, prisoners who would otherwise run the risk of having the federal statute of limitations expire while they are exhausting their state remedies will have no choice but to file premature federal petitions accompanied by a request to stay federal proceedings pending the exhaustion of their state remedies.  Cf. <em>Rhines</em> v. <em>Weber</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 8.  The Court admits that this type of protective filing will result from its holding.  See <em>ante, </em>at 8.  I fail to see any merit in a rule that knowingly and unnecessarily \xe2\x80\x9cadd[s] to the burdens on the district courts in a way that simple tolling \xe2\x80\xa6 would not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Duncan</em>, 533 U. S., at 192 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond increasing the burdens faced by district courts, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s tacit encouragement of countless new protective filings will diminish the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory incentives to proceed first in state court\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cincrease the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 180.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), along with \xc2\xa72254(b), to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage litigants <em>first</em> to exhaust all state remedies and <em>then</em> to file their federal habeas petitions as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 181.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule turns that statutory goal on its head\xe2\x80\x94in essence, encouraging all petitioners who have doubts regarding the timeliness of their state petitions to file simultaneously for relief in federal and state court.  <em>Artuz </em>appropriately prevented such a result with respect to procedural bars.  Because I see no reason to depart from that sound approach, I would hold that Pace\xe2\x80\x99s application was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because I would hold that Pace was entitled to statutory tolling, I need not answer the question whether the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant Pace equitable tolling.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Pace\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final in 1986, long before the Pennsylvania Legislature adopted the PCRA\xe2\x80\x99s current statute of limitations.  Pace\xe2\x80\x99s original petition for postconviction relief was filed under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa79541 <em>et seq. </em>(1988) (amended and renamed by Act No. 1988\xe2\x80\x9347, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73, 6, 1988 Pa. Laws pp. 337\xe2\x80\x93342), which did not include a statute of limitations.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Pace\xe2\x80\x99s request for review on September 3, 1992.  The PCRA time bar did not become effective until January 16, 1996.  See Act No. 1995\xe2\x80\x9332, \xc2\xa79579, 1995 Pa. Laws p. 1126 (Spec. Sess. 1).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For instance, Pace argued that his failure to raise the claims below should be excused because of ineffective assistance of counsel.  See App. 191\xe2\x80\x93194, 220\xe2\x80\x93226.  Pace also argued that a failure to consider the new claim would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cmiscarriage of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 192, 217\xe2\x80\x93219, and that his new claims challenged the legality of his sentence, <em>id.,</em> at 189, 192.  To support each of these arguments, Pace cited state cases demonstrating the existence of judicial exceptions to procedural default.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0That time bar provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves that: (i) the failure to <em>raise the claim</em> previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim . . . ; (ii) the facts upon which <em>the claim</em> is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 Pa.

Unless the Court means implicitly to overrule <em>Artuz</em>, its rule compels the conclusion that the singular phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d takes on different meanings in different contexts.  That is the same interpretive exercise we unequivocally rejected in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Martinez</em>.  See 543 U.
