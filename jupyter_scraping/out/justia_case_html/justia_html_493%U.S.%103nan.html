On remand, the District Court enjoined the city to reinstate the franchise, but concluded that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1982 ed.) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] did not authorize an award of compensatory damages.  The court reasoned that "the supremacy clause does not create individual rights that may be vindicated in an action for damages under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 493 U. S. 105</a></p><p> Section 1983," <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  857 F.2d 631 (CA9 1988).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the NLRA granted petitioner rights enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983.  489 U.S. 1010 (1989).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1983 provides a federal remedy for "the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws."  As the language of the statute plainly indicates, the remedy encompasses violations of federal statutory as well as constitutional rights.  We have repeatedly held that the coverage of the statute must be broadly construed.  <em>See, e.g., Felder v. Casey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/case.html">487 U. S. 131</a></span> (1988); <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U.

It provides a remedy "against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights."  <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U.

S. 700</a></span>-701 (1978).</p>\n<p>A determination that \xc2\xa7 1983 is available to remedy a statutory or constitutional violation involves a two-step inquiry.  First, the plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right.  <em>See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html">453 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/1/case.html#19">453 U. S. 19</a></span> (1981).  Section 1983 speaks in terms of "rights, privileges, or immunities," not violations of federal law.  In deciding whether a federal right has been violated, we have considered whether the provision in question creates obligations binding on the governmental unit, or rather "does no more than express a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment."  <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html#19">451 U. S. 19</a></span> (1981).  The interest the plaintiff asserts must not be "too vague and amorphous" to be "beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce."  <em>Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html">479 U.

We have also asked whether the provision in question was "inten[ded] to benefit" the putative plaintiff.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#430">479 U.

Robinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/992/case.html">468 U.

The availability of administrative mechanisms to protect plaintiff\'s interests is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that Congress intended to foreclose a \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy.  <em>See Wright,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#425">479 U.

Conversely, the fact that a federal statute has preempted certain state action does not preclude the possibility that the same federal statute may create a federal right for which \xc2\xa7 1983 provides a remedy.\n</em></p>\n<p>In all cases, the availability of the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy turns on whether the statute, by its terms or as interpreted, creates obligations "sufficiently specific and definite" to be within "the competence of the judiciary to enforce," <em>Wright,</em> 479 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#432">479 U.

S. 423</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The nub of the controversy between the parties is whether the NLRA creates "rights" in labor and management that are protected against governmental interference.  The city does not argue, nor could it, that a \xc2\xa7 1983 action is precluded by the existence of a comprehensive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 493 U. S. 109</a></p><p> enforcement scheme.  Although the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices by employers and unions, it has no authority to address conduct protected by the NLRA against governmental interference. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  There is thus no comprehensive enforcement scheme for preventing state interference with federally protected labor rights that would foreclose the \xc2\xa7 1983 remedy.  Nor can there be any substantial question that our holding in <em>Golden State I</em> that the city\'s conduct was preempted was within the competence of the judiciary to enforce.  Rather, the city argues that it cannot be held liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 because its conduct did not violate any rights secured by the NLRA.  On the basis of our previous cases, we reject this argument.  We agree with petitioner that it is the intended beneficiary of a statutory scheme that prevents governmental interference with the collective bargaining process and that the NLRA gives it rights enforceable against governmental interference in an action under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>In the NLRA, Congress has not just "occupied the field" with legislation that is passed solely with the interests of the general public in mind.  In such circumstances, when congressional preemption benefits particular parties only as an incident of the federal scheme of regulation, a private damages remedy under \xc2\xa7 1983 may not be available.  The NLRA, however, creates rights in labor and management both against one another and against the State. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  By its terms, the Act confers certain rights "generally on employees and not merely as against the employer."  <em>Hill v. Florida ex rel.

We have held, based on the language, structure, and history of the NLRA, that the Act protects certain rights of labor and management against governmental interference.  While it is true that the rule of the Machinists case is not set forth in the specific text of an enumerated section of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 493 U.

A rule of law that is the product of judicial interpretation of a vague, ambiguous or incomplete statutory provision is no less binding than a rule that is based on the plain meaning of a statute.  The violation of a federal right that has been found to be implicit in a statute\'s language and structure is as much a "direct violation" of a right as is the violation of a right that is clearly set forth in the text of the statute.</p>\n<p>The <em>Machinists</em> rule is not designed -- as is the <em>Garmon</em> rule -- to answer the question whether state or federal regulations should apply to certain conduct.  Rather, it is more akin to a rule that denies either sovereign the authority to abridge a personal liberty.  As much as the welfare benefits in <em>Maine v.

Section 8(d) of the NLRA does not create rights and obligations with respect to third parties who are not parties to a collective bargaining agreement but who, in some way, come in contact with the collective bargaining process.  Rather, Section 8(d) defines the concept of collective bargaining and the obligations of the parties engaged in collective bargaining, and, in the language at issue in this case, states that the failure to make a concession during collective bargaining negotiations is not an unfair labor practice.  Thus, while the Supreme Court in this case relied on Section 8(d) in holding that the City\'s action was preempted because it would have the effect of forcing a bargaining concession by Golden State, it would strain the language and purpose of the NLRA and misconstrue the import of the Supreme Court opinion to find that the City \'directly violated\' Section 8(d) solely by virtue of the fact that it took some action preempted by that section."</p>\n<p><em>Golden State Transit Corp. v.

In order to give meaning to the entire statute, we held that the reference to constitutional claims therefore did not include rights secured solely by the Supremacy Clause.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The same is true with respect to \xc2\xa7 1983.  If the Supremacy Clause itself were understood to secure constitutional rights, the reference to "and laws" would have been wholly unnecessary.  It follows that a Supremacy Clause claim based on a statutory violation is enforceable under \xc2\xa7 1983 only when the statute creates "rights, privileges, or immunities" in the particular plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was thus mistaken in ruling that, because the NLRB has exclusive jurisdiction to redress violations of the NLRA by labor and management, the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to address claims of governmental interference with interests protected by the Act.

With all respect, I dissent.  Although I agree with much of the majority\'s discussion of both \xc2\xa7 1983 and the NLRA, I do not consider these statutes to provide Golden State a remedy.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v.

Although the city\'s lack of power in a sense immunized Golden State from interference by the city, in my view the NLRA did not secure this immunity within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.  The District Court, however, had jurisdiction to enjoin the city\'s preempted action under other federal statutes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>From the earliest cases interpreting our constitutional law to the most recent ones, we have acknowledged that a private party can assert an immunity from state or local regulation on the ground that the Constitution or a federal statute, or both, allocate the power to enact the regulation to the National Government, to the exclusion of the States.  A litigant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 493 U. S. 114</a></p><p> has standing to contend that proper allocation of power requires a particular outcome in a dispute, and this is so whether the dispute is between individual parties, <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/22/1/case.html">Gibbons v.

The injured party does not need \xc2\xa7 1983 to vest in him a right to assert that an attempted exercise of jurisdiction or control violates the proper distribution of powers within the federal system.</p>\n<p>I submit that the Court should not interpret \xc2\xa7 1983 to give a cause of action for damages when the only wrong committed by the State or its local entities is misapprehending the precise location of the boundaries between state and federal power.  The dispute over the taxicab franchise involves no greater transgression than this.  The NLRA, through preemption, did create a legal interest in Golden State, an interest which the city infringed, but it does not follow that Golden State may obtain relief under \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The NLRA creates two relations which encompass different legal interests.  The statute creates the first relation between Golden State and the striking union.  The statute establishes duties that Golden State and the Union have to each other and, as correlatives of these duties, rights that they have against each other.  Under the NLRA, for example, each has a duty to bargain in good faith and, as correlatives of these duties, each has a right to have the other bargain in good faith.  <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(d) (1982 ed.).  The Court of Appeals was correct to determine that the allegations of injury in this case do not implicate the rights and duties </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 493 U. S. 115</a></p><p> which flow from this first legal relation.  <em>See</em> 857 F.2d 631, 635 (CA9 1988).</p>\n<p>The NLRA also creates a jural relation between the city and Golden State.  Although the NLRA does not provide in any detailed way how a city should act when renewing an operating franchise, the statute does have a preemptive effect under the Supremacy Clause.  When we analyzed this preemption in <em>Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html">427 U. S. 132</a></span> (1976), we ruled that, although the NLRB affords the States the power to regulate activities within its peripheral concern, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#137">427 U. S. 137</a></span>, the States have no such power or authority to influence the substantive terms of collective bargaining agreements, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#147">427 U. S. 147</a></span>-151.  Applying <em>Machinists</em> in <em>Golden State I,</em> we held that the city has no power to interfere with the NLRA by conditioning Golden State\'s franchise renewal upon settlement of a labor dispute.  <em>See</em> 475 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/case.html#618">475 U. S. 618</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The city\'s lack of power gives rise to a correlative legal interest in Golden State that we did not discuss in <em>Golden State I.</em>  The majority has chosen to call the interest a right.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html#112">493 U. S. 112</a></span>.  I would prefer to follow the familiar Hohfeldian terminology and say that Golden State has an immunity from the city\'s interference with the NLRA.  <em>See</em> Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 Yale L.J. 16, 55-58 (1913) (defining the correlative of no power as an immunity).  This terminology best reflects Congress\' intent to create the free zone of bargaining we described in <em>Machinists.  See</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#153">427 U.

The case before us today asks how \xc2\xa7 1983 applies to claims of preemption.  We have not answered this question in other decisions, but we have ruled that</p>\n<p>"an allegation of incompatibility between federal and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 493 U. S. 116</a></p><p> state statutes and regulations does not, in itself, give rise to a claim \'secured by the Constitution\' within the meaning of [28 U.S.C.] \xc2\xa7 1343"</p>\n<p>or, as the majority agrees, within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html">441 U.

The preemptive federal statute, instead, must secure a right, privilege, or immunity in order for \xc2\xa7 1983 to provide a remedy.  441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/600/case.html#615">441 U. S. 615</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The preceding analysis shows that Golden State has an immunity that arose out of a relation created by the NLRA.  Unlike the majority, however, I do not think that the NLRA secures this immunity as contemplated by Chapman.  Section 1983 uses the word "secure" to mean "protect" or "make certain," <em>Hague v. C.I.O.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">307 U.

Globe, 42 Cong., 1st Sess., 317 (1871), recognized and explained the distinction as follows:</p>\n<p>"Most of the provisions of the Constitution, which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in the tenth section of first article, that \'no State shall make a treaty,\' \'grant letters of marque,\' \'coin money,\' \'emit bills of credit,\' &amp; c., relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments.  They do not relate directly to the rights of persons within the States and as between the States and such persons therein.  These prohibitions upon the political powers of the States are all of such nature that they can be, and even have been, when the occasion arose, enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 493 U. S. 117</a></p><p> acts of encroachment on Federal powers.  Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States \'enforced\' those provisions of the Constitution.  But there are some that are not of this class.  These are where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at App. 69.</p>\n<p>Representative Shellabarger spoke only of interests secured by the Constitution.  Our cases in recent years have expanded the scope of \xc2\xa7 1983 beyond that contemplated by the sponsor of the statute and have identified interests secured by various statutory provisions as well.  <em>See, e.g., Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html">479 U. S. 418</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/479/418/case.html#431">479 U. S. 431</a></span>-432 (1987) (right to particular calculation of rent in public housing secured by the Brooke Amendment to the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1437a (1982 ed. and Supp. V)); <em>Maine v. Thiboutot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html">448 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#2">448 U. S. 2</a></span>-3 (1980) (right to benefits secured by the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(7) (1976 ed.)).  None of these secured statutory interests, however, has been the sole result of a statute\'s preemptive effect, as has Golden State\'s immunity from the city\'s interference.</p>\n<p>Preemption concerns the federal structure of the Nation, rather than the securing of individual rights, privileges, and immunities to individuals.  Although the majority finds the <em>Machinists</em> preemption doctrine "akin to a rule that denies either sovereign the authority to abridge a personal liberty," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html#112">493 U. S. 112</a></span>, and describes the interest of being free of governmental regulation as a right specifically conferred by the NLRA on employers and employees, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/case.html#109">493 U. S. 109</a></span>, I cannot agree that federal law secures this legal interest within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>Golden State does not and cannot contend that a federal statute protects it from the city\'s primary conduct apart from its governmental character.  <em>Machinists\'</em> preemption, as noted above, rests upon the allocation of power, rather than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 493 U. S. 118</a></p><p> upon individual rights, privileges, or immunities.  <em>See Machinists,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/case.html#137">427 U. S. 137</a></span>, <l=427 147|="" u.s.="">147-151.  The dispute between Golden State and the city exists because the Federal Government has exercised its power under the Commerce Clause to regulate Golden State\'s labor relations under the NLRA, and thus has deprived the city of the power to effect its own regulations of these relations.  Although our recent decisions in <em>Wright</em> and <em>Maine</em> suggest that Congress could secure individual interests in Golden State through a statute, Congress did not secure them in the NLRA.</l=427></p>\n<p>Golden State\'s immunity, as defined in <em>Machinists,</em> has nothing to do with the substance of the requirement imposed on its collective bargaining.  The immunity for instance, would not prevent the United States from exercising its power under the Commerce Clause to authorize the actions taken by the city.  The immunity, rather, permits the company to object only that the wrong sovereign has attempted to regulate its labor relations.  Golden State\'s immunity does not benefit the company as an individual, but instead results from the Supremacy Clause\'s separate protection of the federal structure and from the division of power in the constitutional system.  Federal law, as such, does not secure this immunity to Golden State within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>The case before us differs from one in which the governmental character of the action itself constitutes only an element in the primary wrong that the injured party seeks to vindicate under the Constitution.  <em>See, e.g., Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span> (1961).  So too is this case unlike statutory cases such as <em>Maine v. Thiboutot.</em>  The plaintiffs in <em>Maine</em> sued state officials under \xc2\xa7 1983 for withholding welfare benefits in violation of the Social Security Act, in particular 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(7) (1976 ed.).  They claimed, in so many words, that the Social Security Act imposed upon the defendants a duty to the plaintiffs to pay the benefits and, as correlative of this duty, gave the plaintiffs a right against the defendants to have benefits paid.  448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#2">448 U. S. 2</a></span>-3.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 493 U. S. 119</a></p><p> The Court\'s expansive interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1983 allowed the plaintiffs to recover damages for the deprivation of this statutory right.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1/case.html#4">448 U. S. 4</a></span>.  The <em>Maine</em> case, however, provides no help to Golden State.  The NLRA affords Golden State no counterpart to the plaintiffs\' individual interests in the Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>By concluding that Golden State may not obtain relief under \xc2\xa7 1983, we would not leave the company without a remedy.  Despite what one might think from the increase of litigation under the statute in recent years, \xc2\xa7 1983 does not provide the exclusive relief that the federal courts have to offer.  When we held in <em>Golden State I</em> that the company could survive summary judgment on a <em>Machinists</em> doctrine preemption claim, we did not purport to make a ruling with respect to \xc2\xa7 1983, and did not even cite the provision.  Our omission of any discussion of \xc2\xa7 1983 perhaps stemmed from a recognition that plaintiffs may vindicate <em>Machinists</em> preemption claims by seeking declaratory and equitable relief in the federal district courts through their powers under federal jurisdictional statutes.  <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331 (1982 ed.); 28 U.S.C.A. \xc2\xa7 2201 (Supp.1989); 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2202 (1982 ed.); <em>New York Tel. Co. v. New York Labor Dept.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/case.html">440 U. S. 519</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/case.html#525">440 U. S. 525</a></span> (1979) (plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief on a <em>Machinists</em> preemption claim).  These statutes do not limit jurisdiction to those who can show the deprivation of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by federal law within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.  Because Golden State asked for such relief in its complaint, <em>see</em> App. 6, 7, 17, the District Court had jurisdiction to enter the injunction on behalf of the company, but not for the reasons that it stated.  As it is my view that Golden State does not have a claim under \xc2\xa7 1983, I dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
