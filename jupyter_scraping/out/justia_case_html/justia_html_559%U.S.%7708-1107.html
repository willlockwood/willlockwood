Hertz sought removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d)(2), 1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of different States, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  Respondents, however, claimed that Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diversity jurisdiction was lacking under \xc2\xa71332(c)(1), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  To show that its \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States, that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity, that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey, and that its core executive and administrative functions are primarily carried out there.  The District Court concluded that it lacked diversity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, <em>inter alia,</em> whether the amount of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s business activity is \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly larger\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially predominates\xe2\x80\x9d in one State.  Finding that California was Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d under that test because a plurality of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court remanded the case to state court.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71453(c)\xe2\x80\x94which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s only to \xe2\x80\x9ccourt[s] of appeals,\xe2\x80\x9d not to the Supreme Court, and provides that if \xe2\x80\x9ca final judgment on the appeal\xe2\x80\x9d in a court of appeals \xe2\x80\x9cis not issued before the end\xe2\x80\x9d of 60 days (with a possible 10-day extension), \xe2\x80\x9cthe appeal shall be denied\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94makes far too much of too little.  The Court normally does not read statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants.  E.g., Felker </em>v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 660\xe2\x80\x93661.  Here, replicating similar, older statutes, \xc2\xa71254 specifically gives the Court jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9crevie[w] \xe2\x80\xa6 [b]y writ of certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d cases that are \xe2\x80\x9cin the courts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d when it grants the writ.  The Court thus interprets \xc2\xa71453(c)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c60-day\xe2\x80\x9d requirement as simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time\xe2\x80\x94not to deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case.  See<em>, e.g.,</em> <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Flowers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/464/index.html">330 U. S. 464</a>, 466\xe2\x80\x93467.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71332(c)(1) refers to the place where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s high level officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s activities, <em>i.e.,</em> its \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d which will typically be found at its corporate headquarters.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdiction demonstrates that Congress added \xc2\xa71332(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court jurisdiction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0However, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d has proved more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.  After Congress\xe2\x80\x99 amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d for diversity purposes.  If a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters and executive offices were in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed straightforward.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d was in that State.  But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were in one State, while the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s plants or other centers of business activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvious.  Under these circumstances, for corporations with \xe2\x80\x9cfar-flung\xe2\x80\x9d business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d from which the corporation radiates out to its constituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  However, this test did not go far enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few States.  When faced with this question, various courts have focused more heavily on where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s actual business activities are located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to interpret the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation of the statutory phrase, this Court returns to the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d approach: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d is best read as referring to the place where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  In practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters\xe2\x80\x94provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <em>i.e.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the Court that the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d approach, while imperfect, is superior to other possibilities.  First, \xc2\xa71332(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s language supports the approach.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s word \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d is singular, not plural.  Its word \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d requires that the main, prominent, or most important place be chosen.  Cf., <em>e.g., Commissioner </em>v. <em>Soliman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/168/index.html">506 U. S. 168</a>, 174.  And the fact that the word \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d follows the words \xe2\x80\x9cState where\xe2\x80\x9d means that the \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d is a place <em>within </em>a State, not the State itself.  A corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d usually its main headquarters, is a single place.  The public often considers it the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s main place of business.  And it is a place within a State.  By contrast, the application of a more general business activities test has led some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within a State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total amount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and determining whether they are significantly larger than in the next-ranking State.  Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.  <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Ruby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/358/index.html">497 U. S. 358</a>, 375.  A \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which ordinarily equates that \xe2\x80\x9ccenter\xe2\x80\x9d with a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters, is simple to apply <em>comparatively speaking</em>.  By contrast, a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s general business activities more often lack a single principal place where they take place.  Third, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history suggests that the words \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d should be interpreted to be no more complex than an earlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical to apply.  A \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test offers such a possibility.  A general business activities test does not.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0While there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria, and there will be hard cases under the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test adopted today, this test is relatively easier<em> </em>to apply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions, assets or revenues different in kind, one from the other.  And though this test may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale of diversity jurisdiction, accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii) If the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipulation\xe2\x80\x94for example, that the alleged \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of an annual executive retreat\xe2\x80\x94the courts should instead take as the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d the place of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the absence of such manipulation.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Although petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s unchallenged declaration suggests that Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d and its corporate headquarters are one and the same, and that they are located in New Jersey, not in California, respondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their case in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)(1) (emphasis added)<em>.  </em>We seek here to resolve different interpretations that the Circuits have given this phrase.  In doing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judicial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible.  And we conclude that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the place where the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s high level officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  Lower federal courts have often metaphorically called that place the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wisconsin Knife Works </em>v. <em>National Metal Crafters</em>, 781 F.\xc2\xa02d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986); <em>Scot Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Underwood Corp.</em>, 170 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 862, 865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.).  We believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d will typically be found at a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and John Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the Hertz Corporation, in a California state court.  They sought damages for what they claimed were violations of California\xe2\x80\x99s wage and hour laws.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.  And they requested relief on behalf of a potential class composed of California citizens who had allegedly suffered similar harms.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(d)(2), 1441(a).  Hertz claimed that the plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different States.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(a)(1), (c)(1).  Hence, the federal court possessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  Friend and Nhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diversity jurisdiction was lacking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration by an employee relations manager that sought to show that Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d was in New Jersey, not in California.  The declaration stated, among other things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States; and that California\xe2\x80\x94which had about 12% of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s population, Pet. for Cert. 8\xe2\x80\x94accounted for 273 of Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s 1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full-time employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in annual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately 21 million annual transactions, <em>i.e.</em>, rentals. The declaration also stated that the \xe2\x80\x9cleadership of Hertz and its domestic subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x9d is located at Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate headquarters\xe2\x80\x9d in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its \xe2\x80\x9ccore executive and administrative functions . . . are carried out\xe2\x80\x9d there and \xe2\x80\x9cto a lesser extent\xe2\x80\x9d in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and that its \xe2\x80\x9cmajor administrative operations . . . are found\xe2\x80\x9d at those two locations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a\xe2\x80\x9330a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court of the Northern District of California accepted Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the facts as undisputed.  But it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citizen of California.  In reaching this conclusion, the court applied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to identify a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d by first determining the amount of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s business activity State by State.  If the amount of activity is \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly larger\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially predominates\xe2\x80\x9d in one State, then that State is the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  If there is no such State, then the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d is the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98nerve center,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the place where \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the majority of its executive and administrative functions are performed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Hertz</em>, No. C\xe2\x80\x9307\xe2\x80\x935222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p.\xc2\xa03 (hereinafter Order); <em>Tosco Corp. </em>v. <em>Communities for a Better Environment</em>, 236 F. 3d 495, 500\xe2\x80\x93502 (CA9 2001) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this test, the District Court found that the \xe2\x80\x9cplurality of each of the relevant business activities\xe2\x80\x9d was in California, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe differential between the amount of those activities\xe2\x80\x9d in California and the amount in \xe2\x80\x9cthe next closest state\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9csignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order 4.  Hence, Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d was California, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking.  The District Court consequently remanded the case to the state courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hertz appealed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order. 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71453(c).  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief memorandum opinion.  297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008).  Hertz filed a petition for certiorari.  And, in light of differences among the Circuits in the application of the test for corporate citizenship, we granted the writ.  Compare <em>Tosco Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 500\xe2\x80\x93502, and <em>Capitol Indemnity Corp. </em>v. <em>Russellville Steel Co.</em>, 367 F.\xc2\xa03d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (applying \xe2\x80\x9ctotal activity\xe2\x80\x9d test and looking at \xe2\x80\x9call corporate activities\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Wisconsin Knife Works</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1282 (applying \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection. Respondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remand order to the Court of Appeals, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71453(c), constitutes an exception to a more general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are \xe2\x80\x9cnot reviewable on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71447(d).  They add that the language of \xc2\xa71453(c) refers only to \xe2\x80\x9ccourt[s] of appeals,\xe2\x80\x9d not to the Supreme Court.  The statute also says that if \xe2\x80\x9ca final judgment on the appeal\xe2\x80\x9d in a court of appeals \xe2\x80\x9cis not issued before the end\xe2\x80\x9d of 60 days (with a possible 10-day extension), \xe2\x80\x9cthe appeal shall be denied.\xe2\x80\x9d  And respondents draw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion that Congress intended to permit review of a remand order only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court (at least not if, as here, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of certiorari comes after \xc2\xa71453(c)\xe2\x80\x99s time period has elapsed).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument, however, makes far too much of too little.  We normally do not read statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants. <em>Felker </em>v. <em>Turpin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/651/index.html">518 U. S. 651</a>, 660\xe2\x80\x93661 (1996); <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 8 Wall. 85, 104\xe2\x80\x93105 (1869).   Here, another, pre-existing federal statute gives this Court jurisdiction to \xe2\x80\x9crevie[w] . . .

This statutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants that yet older statutes provided.  See, <em>e.g., </em>\xc2\xa71254, 62 Stat. 928; \xc2\xa71, 43 Stat. 938\xe2\x80\x93939 (amending \xc2\xa7240, 36 Stat. 1157); \xc2\xa7240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, \xc2\xa76, 26 Stat. 828.

The Constitution provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power shall extend\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cControversies . . . between Citizens of different States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72.  This language, however, does not automatically confer diversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts.  Rather, it authorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine the scope of the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction within constitutional limits.  <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Burke Constr. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/260/226/index.html">260 U. S. 226</a>, 233\xe2\x80\x93234 (1922); <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Cooper</em>, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary Act, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear suits \xe2\x80\x9cbetween a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa711, 1 Stat. 78.  The statute said nothing about corporations.  In 1809, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court, described a corporation as an \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible, intangible, and artificial being\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not a citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bank of United States </em>v<em>. Deveaux, </em>5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809).  But the Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders were all citizens of a different State from the defendants, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe term citizen ought to be understood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is used in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons who come into court, in this case, under their corporate name.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 91\xe2\x80\x9392.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In<em> Louisville, C. &amp; C. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Letson</em>, 2 How. 497 (1844), the Court modified this initial approach.  It held that a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of the State by which it had been created, and its citizenship for jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly.  <em>Id.,</em> at 558\xe2\x80\x93559.  Ten years later, the Court in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.</em>, 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the reason<em> </em>a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorporation was that, for the limited purpose of determining corporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artificially) presume that a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s <em>shareholders</em> were citizens of the State of incorporation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327\xe2\x80\x93328.  And it reaffirmed <em>Letson.  </em>16 How., at 325\xe2\x80\x93326.  Whatever the rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity purposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be a citizen of the State of its incorporation.  13F C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73623, pp. 1\xe2\x80\x937 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1928 this Court made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cstate of incorporation\xe2\x80\x9d rule was virtually absolute.  It held that a corporation closely identified with State A could proceed in a federal court located in that State as long as the corporation had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps a State where the corporation did no business at all.  See <em>Black and White Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co. </em>v. <em>Brown and Yellow Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/276/518/index.html">276 U. S. 518</a>, 522\xe2\x80\x93525 (refusing to question corporation\xe2\x80\x99s reincorporation motives and finding diversity jurisdiction).  Subsequently, many in Congress and those who testified before it pointed out that this interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s basic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 doors to those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice against out-of-state parties.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 530, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 2, 4\xe2\x80\x937 (1932).  Through its choice of the State of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate federal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its business by filing incorporation papers elsewhere.  <em>Id.</em>, at 4 (\xe2\x80\x9cSince the Supreme Court has decided that a corporation is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for corporations to be incorporated in one State while they do business in another.  And there is no doubt but that it often occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have the advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Hearings on S. 937 et\xc2\xa0al. before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4\xe2\x80\x935 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George W. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May 24, 1930)) (citing a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon practice for individuals to incorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of taking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although various legislative proposals to curtail the corporate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, <em>e.g., </em>S.\xc2\xa0937, S.\xc2\xa0939, H.\xc2\xa0R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932), none of these proposals were enacted into law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time as federal dockets increased in size, many judges began to believe those dockets contained too many diversity cases.  A committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States studied the matter.  See Reports of the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and Special Meeting (Sept. 24\xe2\x80\x9326 &amp; Mar. 19\xe2\x80\x9320, 1951), in H.\xc2\xa0R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (1952).  And on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar. Committee Rept.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among its observations, the committee found a general need \xe2\x80\x9cto prevent frauds and abuses\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14.  The committee recommended against eliminating diversity cases altogether.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28.  Instead it recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory amendment that would make a corporation a citizen both of the State of its incorporation and any State from which it received more than half of its gross income.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (requiring corporation to show that \xe2\x80\x9cless than fifty per cent of its gross income was derived from business transacted within the state where the Federal court is held\xe2\x80\x9d).  If, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state law in state court) a corporation that received half or more of its gross income from California, that corporation would not be able to remove the case to federal court, even if Delaware was its State of incorporation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the spring and summer of 1951 committee members circulated their report and attended circuit conferences at which federal judges discussed the report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.  Reflecting those criticisms, the committee filed a new report in September, in which it revised its corporate citizenship recommendation.  It now proposed that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state of its original creation \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] shall also be deemed a citizen of a state where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Committee on Jurisdiction and Venue 4 (Sept. 24, 1951) (hereinafter Sept.

See Hearings on H.\xc2\xa0R. 2516 et\xc2\xa0al. before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1957) (hereinafter House Hearings).  The committee wrote that this new language would provide a \xe2\x80\x9csimpler and more practical formula\xe2\x80\x9d than the \xe2\x80\x9cgross income\xe2\x80\x9d test.  Sept. Committee Rept. 2.  It added that the language \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] a precedent in the jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In mid-1957 the committee presented its reports to the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary.

Judge Albert Maris, representing Judge John Parker (who had chaired the Judicial Conference Committee), discussed various proposals that the Judicial Conference had made to restrict the scope of diversity jurisdiction.  In respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d proposal, he said that the relevant language \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  House Hearings 37.  He added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy cases, and as I recall the cases\xe2\x80\x94and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be bound by this statement because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t them before me\xe2\x80\x94I think the courts have generally taken the view that where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s interests are rather widespread, the principal place of business is an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one.  It is the actual place where its business operations are coordinated, directed, and carried out, which would ordinarily be the place where its officers carry on its day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept, where its payments are made, and not necessarily a State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corporation, or something of that sort.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBut that has been pretty well worked out in the bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available, you see, to be applied here without having to go over it again from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference Committee Reports along with other reports and relevant testimony and circulated it to the general public \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.\xe2\x80\x9d Id.</em>, at III.  Subsequently, in 1958, Congress both codified the courts\xe2\x80\x99 traditional place of incorporation test and also enacted into law a slightly modified version of the Conference Committee\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d language.  A corporation was to \xe2\x80\x9cbe deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72, 72 Stat. 415.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d has proved more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.  Decisions under the Bankruptcy Act did not provide the firm guidance for which Judge Maris had hoped because courts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about how to determine a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business.\xe2\x80\x9d   Compare <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Dillon</em>, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1 1906) (holding that a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal office, rather than a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the \xe2\x80\x98principal place of business\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Continental Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>Roszelle Bros.</em>, 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d as the location of mining activities, rather than the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal office\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Friedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11 Stan. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe cases under the Bankruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determination of the principal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After Congress\xe2\x80\x99 amendment, courts were similarly uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d for diversity purposes.  If a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters and executive offices were in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed straightforward.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d was located in that State.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Long </em>v. <em>Silver</em>, 248 F.\xc2\xa03d 309, 314\xe2\x80\x93315 (CA4 2001); <em>Pinnacle Consultants, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Leucadia Nat. Corp.</em>, 101 F.\xc2\xa03d 900, 906\xe2\x80\x93907 (CA2 1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But suppose those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, are in one State, while the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s plants or other centers of business activity are located in other States?  In 1959 a distinguished federal district judge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act to answer this question in part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a corporation is engaged in far-flung and varied activities which are carried on in different states, its principal place of business is the nerve center from which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from which its officers direct, control and coordinate all activities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of the corporate objective.  The test applied by our Court of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an \xe2\x80\x98office from which its business was directed and controlled\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the place where \xe2\x80\x98all of its business was under the supreme direction and control of its officers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scot Typewriter Co.,</em> 170 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 865.</p>\n<p align="left">\nNumerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test for corporations with \xe2\x80\x9cfar-flung\xe2\x80\x9d business activities.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Topp </em>v. <em>Compair Inc.</em>, 814 F.\xc2\xa02d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J. Moore et\xc2\xa0al., Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Practice \xc2\xa7102.54[2], p. 102\xe2\x80\x93112.1 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Moore\xe2\x80\x99s).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Scot</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, however, did not go far enough.  For it did not answer what courts should do when the operations of the corporation are not \xe2\x80\x9cfar-flung\xe2\x80\x9d but rather limited to only a few States.  When faced with this question, various courts have focused more heavily on where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s actual business activities are located.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Diaz-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Pep Boys Corp</em>., 410 F.\xc2\xa03d 56, 60\xe2\x80\x9361 (CA1 2005); <em>R. G. Barry Corp. </em>v. <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc.</em>, 612 F.\xc2\xa02d 651, 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (CA2 1979); see also 15 Moore\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7102.54, at 102\xe2\x80\x93112.1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps because corporations come in many different forms, involve many different kinds of business activities, and locate offices and plants for different reasons in different ways in different regions, a general \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness activities\xe2\x80\x9d approach has proved unusually difficult to apply.  Courts must decide which factors are more important than others: for example, plant location, sales or servicing centers; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>R.</em>\xc2\xa0<em>G. Barry Corp.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (place of sales and advertisement, office, and full-time employees); <em>Diaz-Rodriguez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (place of stores and inventory, employees, income, and sales).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The number of factors grew as courts explicitly combined aspects of the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness activity\xe2\x80\x9d tests to look to a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctotal activities,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes to try to determine what treatises have described as the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccenter of gravity.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Gafford </em>v. <em>General Elec.

But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.  After all, the relevant purposive concern\xe2\x80\x94prejudice against an out-of-state party\xe2\x80\x94will often depend upon factors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s image, its history, and its advertising, while the factors that courts can more easily measure, for example, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or the nature of the goods or services it supplies, will sometimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likelihood of prejudice.  At the same time, this approach is at war with administrative simplicity.

We conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d is best read as referring to the place where a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  It is the place that Courts of Appeals have called the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters\xe2\x80\x94provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <em>i.e.</em>, the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings (for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us that this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other possibilities.  First, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language supports the approach.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text deems a corporation a citizen of the \xe2\x80\x9cState where it has its principal place of business.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)(1).  The word \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d is\nin the singular, not the plural.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d re-quires us to pick out the \xe2\x80\x9cmain, prominent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cleading\xe2\x80\x9d place.  12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989) (def. (A)(I)(2)).  Cf. <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Soliman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/506/168/index.html">506 U. S. 168</a>, 174 (1993) (interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d for tax purposes to require an assessment of \xe2\x80\x9cwhether any one business location is the \xe2\x80\x98most important, consequential, or influential\xe2\x80\x99 one\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the fact that the word \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d follows the words \xe2\x80\x9cState where\xe2\x80\x9d means that the \xe2\x80\x9cplace\xe2\x80\x9d is a place <em>within </em>a State.  It is not the State itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d usually its main headquarters, is a single place.  The public often (though not always) considers it the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s main place of business.  And it is a place within a State.  By contrast, the application of a more general business activities test has led some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within a State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total amount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and determining whether they are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly larger\xe2\x80\x9d than in the next-ranking State.  297 Fed. Appx. 690.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to strange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.  Namely, if a \xe2\x80\x9ccorporation may be deemed a citizen of California on th[e] basis\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cactivities [that] roughly reflect California\xe2\x80\x99s larger population . . . nearly every national retailer\xe2\x80\x94no matter how far flung its operations\xe2\x80\x94will be deemed a citizen of California for diversity purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>HSBC Bank Nev., N. A.</em>, 557 F. 3d 1026, 1029\xe2\x80\x931030 (2009).  But why award or decline diversity jurisdiction on the basis of a State\xe2\x80\x99s population, whether measured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with modifications?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.  <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Ruby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/358/index.html">497 U. S. 358</a>, 375 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing \xe2\x80\x9cthe sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the area of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible\xe2\x80\x9d).  Complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up time and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court is the right court to decide those claims.  Cf. <em>Navarro</em> <em>Savings Assn.</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/index.html">446 U. S. 458</a>, 464, n.\xc2\xa013 (1980).  Complex tests produce appeals and reversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish the likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a claim\xe2\x80\x99s legal and factual merits.  Judicial resources too are at stake.  Courts have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even when no party challenges it.  <em>Arbaugh </em>v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/500/index.html">546 U. S. 500</a>, 514 (2006) (citing <em>Ruhrgas AG</em> v. <em>Marathon Oil Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/574/index.html">526 U. S. 574</a>, 583 (1999)).  So courts benefit from straightforward rules under which they can readily assure themselves of their power to hear a case.  <em>Arbaugh</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 514.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predictability.  Predictability is valuable to corporations making business and investment decisions. Cf. <em>First Nat. City Bank </em>v. <em>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/611/index.html">462 U. S. 611</a>, 621 (1983) (recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cneed for certainty and predictability of result while generally protecting the justified expectations of parties with interests in the corporation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding whether to file suit in a state or federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which ordinarily equates that \xe2\x80\x9ccenter\xe2\x80\x9d with a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters, is simple to apply <em>comparatively speaking</em>.  The metaphor of a corporate \xe2\x80\x9cbrain,\xe2\x80\x9d while not precise, suggests a single location.  By contrast, a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s general business activities more often lack a single principal place where they take place.  That is to say, the corporation may have several plants, many sales locations, and employees located in many different places.  If so, it will not be as easy to determine which of these different business locales is the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d or most important \xe2\x80\x9cplace.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history, for those who accept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive benchmark.  The Judicial Conference provided an initial version of its proposal that suggested a numerical test.  A corporation would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted for more than half of its gross income.  Mar. Committee Rept. 14\xe2\x80\x9315; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  The Conference changed its mind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too complex and impractical to apply.  Sept. Committee Rept. 2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S.\xc2\xa0Rep. 1830, at 31.  That history suggests that the words \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d should be interpreted to be no more complex than the initial \xe2\x80\x9chalf of gross income\xe2\x80\x9d test.  A \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test offers such a possibility.  A general business activities test does not.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria.  We recognize as well that, under the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test we adopt today, there will be hard cases.  For example, in this era of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations, perhaps communicating over the Internet.  That said, our test nonetheless points courts in a single direction, towards the center of overall direction, control, and coordination.  Courts do not have to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or revenues different in kind, one from the other.  Our approach provides a sensible test that is relatively easier<em> </em>to apply, not a test that will, in all instances, automatically generate a result.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also recognize that the use of a \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test may in some cases produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale for 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332, see <em>supra</em>, at 6.  For example, if the bulk of a company\xe2\x80\x99s business activities visible to the public take place in New Jersey, while its top officers direct those activities just across the river in New York, the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d is New York.  One could argue that members of the public in New Jersey would be <em>less </em>likely to be prejudiced against the corporation than persons in New York\xe2\x80\x94yet the corporation will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case to federal court.  And note too that the same corporation would be unable to remove a New York state case to federal court, despite the New York public\xe2\x80\x99s presumed prejudice against the corporation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise. However, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule, we must accept them.  Accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity jurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.  <em>Kokkonen </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/375/index.html">511 U. S. 375</a>, 377 (1994); <em>McNutt </em>v. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/298/178/index.html">298 U. S. 178</a>, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa73602.1, at 119.  When challenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allegations by competent proof.  <em>McNutt</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 189; 15 Moore\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7102.14, at 102\xe2\x80\x9332 to 102\xe2\x80\x9332.1.  And when faced with such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere filing of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Form 10\xe2\x80\x93K listing a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal executive offices\xe2\x80\x9d would, without more, be sufficient proof to establish a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> SEC Form 10\xe2\x80\x93K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Cf. <em>Dimmitt &amp; Owens Financial, Inc. </em>v<em>. United States</em>, 787 F.\xc2\xa02d 1186, 1190\xe2\x80\x931192 (CA7 1986) (distinguishing \xe2\x80\x9cprinciple executive office\xe2\x80\x9d in the tax lien context, see 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76323(f)(2), from \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)).  Such possibilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation, thereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal place of business\xe2\x80\x9d language in the diversity statute.  Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipulation\xe2\x80\x94for example, that the alleged \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a computer, or the location of an annual executive retreat\xe2\x80\x94the courts should instead take as the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d the place of actual direction, control, and coordination, in the absence of such manipulation.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s unchallenged declaration suggests that Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s center of direction, control, and coordination, its \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center,\xe2\x80\x9d and its corporate headquarters are one and the same, and they are located in New Jersey, not in California.  Because respondents should have a fair op-\nportunity to litigate their case in light of our holding, however, we vacate the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
