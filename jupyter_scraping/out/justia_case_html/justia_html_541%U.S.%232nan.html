Argued February 23, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 21, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) regulates, <em>inter alia</em>, the disclosures that credit card issuers must make to consumers, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71637(a), and provides consumers with a civil remedy for creditors\xe2\x80\x99 failure to comply, \xc2\xa71640.  Among other things, the creditor\xe2\x80\x99s periodic balance statement to the consumer must include \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he amount of any finance charge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71637(b)(4), which is defined as an amount \xe2\x80\x9cpayable directly or indirectly by the [consumer], and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71605(a).  Section \xc2\xa71604(a) expressly gives to the Federal Reserve Board (Board) expansive authority to prescribe regulations containing \xe2\x80\x9csuch classifications, differentiations, or other provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d as, in the Board\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, \xe2\x80\x9care necessary or proper to effectuate [TILA\xe2\x80\x99s] purposes \xe2\x80\xa6 , to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s Regulation Z interprets \xc2\xa71605(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d definition to exclude \xe2\x80\x9ccharges \xe2\x80\xa6 for exceeding a credit limit\xe2\x80\x9d (over-limit fees).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent holds a credit card issued by one of the petitioner financial institutions and in which the other holds an interest.  Although the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement set respondent\xe2\x80\x99s credit limit at $2,000, she was able to make charges exceeding that limit, subject to a $29 over-limit fee for each month in which her balance exceeded $2,000.  While her monthly billing statement disclosed the over-limit fees, the amount was not included as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge,\xe2\x80\x9d consistent with Regulation Z.  Respondent filed suit alleging that petitioners violated TILA by failing to classify over-limit fees as \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charges,\xe2\x80\x9d but the District Court granted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss on the ground that Regulation Z specifically excludes such fees.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the exclusion conflicts with \xc2\xa71605(a)\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.  Noting, first, that, as a remedial statute, TILA must be liberally interpreted in favor of consumers, the court then concluded that the over-limit fees in this case were imposed \xe2\x80\x9cincident to an extension of credit\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore fell squarely within \xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x99s language.  That conclusion turned on the distinction the court drew between unilateral acts of default, which would not generate a \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge,\xe2\x80\x9d and acts of default resulting from an agreement between the creditor and the consumer, which would.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Regulation Z is not an unreasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa71605.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because respondent does not challenge the Board\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa71604(a) to issue binding regulations, this Court faces only two questions.  It asks, first, whether \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842, in which case courts, as well as the Board, \xe2\x80\x9cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 842\xe2\x80\x93843<em>.</em>  However, whenever Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly left a gap for the [implementing] agency to fill,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is \xe2\x80\x9cgiven controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0TILA itself does not explicitly address whether over-limit fees are included within the \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  The Sixth Circuit did not attempt to clarify the scope of \xc2\xa71605(a)\xe2\x80\x99s critical term \xe2\x80\x9cincident to the extension of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincident to\xe2\x80\x9d does not make clear whether a substantial (as opposed to a remote) connection is required between an antecedent and its object, cf. <em>Holly Farms Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/392/index.html">517 U. S. 392</a>, 402, n.\xc2\xa09, it cannot be concluded that the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge,\xe2\x80\x9d standing alone, unambiguously includes over-limit fees.  Moreover, an examination of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s related provisions, as well as the full text of \xc2\xa71605 itself, casts doubt on the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  A consumer holding an open-end credit plan may incur two types of charges\xe2\x80\x94finance charges and \xe2\x80\x9cother charges which may be imposed as part of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71637(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  TILA does not make clear which charges fall into each category, but its recognition of at least two categories establishes that Congress did not contemplate that <em>all</em> charges made in connection with an open-end credit plan would be considered \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  And where TILA explicitly addresses over-limit fees, it defines them as fees imposed \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with an extension of credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71637(c)(1)(B)(iii), rather than \xe2\x80\x9cincident to an extension of credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a).  Furthermore, none of \xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x99s specific examples of charges that fall within the \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d definition includes over-limit or comparable fees.  Thus, 1605(a) is, at best, ambiguous.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Regulation Z\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion of over-limit fees from \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge[s]\xe2\x80\x9d is in no way manifestly contrary to \xc2\xa71605.  Regulation Z defines \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of consumer credit,\xe2\x80\x9d excluding as less relevant to determining such cost a number of specific payments, including over-limit fees, that do not automatically recur or are imposed only when a consumer defaults on a credit agreement.  Because over-limit fees are imposed only in the latter circumstance, they can reasonably be characterized as a penalty for defaulting on the credit agreement, and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to exclude them from \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge[s]\xe2\x80\x9d is reasonable.  Despite the Board\xe2\x80\x99s rational decision to adopt a uniform rule excluding from the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d <em>all</em> penalties imposed for exceeding the credit limit, the lower court adopted a case-by-case approach contingent on whether an act of default was \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  That approach would prove unworkable to creditors and, more importantly, lead to significant confusion for the consumer, who would be able to decipher if a charge is more properly a \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d or an \xe2\x80\x9cother charge\xe2\x80\x9d only by recalling the details of the particular transaction that caused him to exceed his credit limit.  In most cases, the consumer would not even know the relevant facts, which are contingent on the nature of the authorization given by the creditor to the merchant.  Here, the Board accomplished all of the objectives set forth in \xc2\xa71604(a)\xe2\x80\x99s broad delegation of rulemaking authority when it set forth a clear, easy to apply (and easy to enforce) rule that highlights the charges the Board determined to be most relevant to a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit decisions.

We conclude that it is not, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, Sharon Pfennig, holds a credit card initially issued by petitioner Household Credit Services, Inc. (Household), but in which petitioner MBNA America Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A. (MBNA), now holds an interest through the acquisition of Household\xe2\x80\x99s credit card portfolio.  Although the terms of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s credit card agreement set respondent\xe2\x80\x99s credit limit at $2,000, respondent was able to make charges exceeding that limit, subject to a $29 \xe2\x80\x9cover-limit fee\xe2\x80\x9d for each month in which her balance exceeded $2,000.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TILA regulates, <em>inter alia</em>, the substance and form of disclosures that creditors offering \xe2\x80\x9copen end consumer credit plans\xe2\x80\x9d (a term that includes credit card accounts) must make to consumers, \xc2\xa71637(a), and provides a civil remedy for consumers who suffer damages as a result of a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with TILA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions, \xc2\xa71640.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  When a creditor and a consumer enter into an open-end consumer credit plan, the creditor is required to provide to the consumer a statement for each billing cycle for which there is an outstanding balance due.  \xc2\xa71637(b).  The statement must include the account\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding balance at the end of the billing period, \xc2\xa71637(b)(8), and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he amount of any finance charge added to the account during the period, itemized to show the amounts, if any, due to the application of percentage rates and the amount, if any, imposed as a minimum or fixed charge,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71637(b)(4).  A \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d is an amount \xe2\x80\x9cpayable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71605(a).  The Board has interpreted this definition to exclude \xe2\x80\x9c[c]harges \xe2\x80\xa6 for exceeding a credit limit.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 12 CFR \xc2\xa7226.4(c)(2) (2004) (Regulation Z).  Thus, although respondent\xe2\x80\x99s billing statement disclosed the imposition of an over-limit fee when she exceeded her $2,000 credit limit, consistent with Regulation Z, the amount was not included as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 24, 1999, respondent filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on behalf of a purported nationwide class of all consumers who were charged or assessed over-limit fees by petitioners.  Respondent alleged in her complaint that petitioners allowed her and each of the other putative class members to exceed their credit limits, thereby subjecting them to over-limit fees.  Petitioners violated TILA, respondent alleged, by failing to classify the over-limit fees as \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charges\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cmisrepresented the true cost of credit\xe2\x80\x9d to respondent and the other class members.  Class Action Complaint in No. C2\xe2\x80\x9399 815 \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;34\xe2\x80\x9339, App. to Pet. for Cert. A39\xe2\x80\x93A40.  Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that Regulation Z specifically excludes over-limit fees from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 CFR \xc2\xa7226.4(c)(2) (2004).  The District Court agreed and granted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, respondent argued, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that Regulation Z\xe2\x80\x99s explicit exclusion of over-limit fees from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d conflicts with the plain language of 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a).  The Court of Appeals first noted that, as a remedial statute, TILA must be liberally interpreted in favor of consumers.  295 F.\xc2\xa03d 522, 528 (CA6 2002).  The Court of Appeals then concluded that the over-limit fees in this case were imposed \xe2\x80\x9cincident to the extension of credit\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore fell squarely within \xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.   The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion turned on the distinction between unilateral acts of default and acts of default resulting from consumers\xe2\x80\x99 requests for additional credit, exceeding a predetermined credit limit, that creditors grant.  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning, a penalty imposed due to a unilateral act of default would not constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 530\xe2\x80\x93531.  Respondent alleged in her complaint, however, that petitioners \xe2\x80\x9callowed [her] to make charges and/or assessed [her] charges that allowed her balance to exceed her credit limit of two thousand dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. A39, \xc2\xb6  ;34, putting her actions under the category of acts of default resulting from consumers requests for additional credit, exceeding a predetermined credit limit, that creditors grant.  The Court of Appeals held that because petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cmade an additional extension of credit to [respondent] over and above the alleged \xe2\x80\x98credit limit,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xb6  ;35, and charged the over-limit fee as a condition of this additional extension of credit, the over-limit fee clearly and unmistakably fell under the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  295 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 530.  Based on its reading of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s allegations, the Court of Appeals limited its holding to \xe2\x80\x9cthose instances in which the creditor knowingly permits the credit card holder to exceed his or her credit limit and then imposes a fee incident to the extension of that credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 532, n.\xc2\xa05.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress has expressly delegated to the Board the authority to prescribe regulations containing \xe2\x80\x9csuch classifications, differentiations, or other provisions\xe2\x80\x9d as, in the judgment of the Board, \xe2\x80\x9care necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of [TILA], to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71604(a).  Thus, the Court has previously recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe [Board] has played a pivotal role in \xe2\x80\x98setting [TILA] in motion\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ford Motor Credit Co.</em> v. <em>Milhollin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/555/index.html">444 U.

Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has specifically designated the [Board] and staff as the primary source for interpretation and application of truth-in-lending law.\xe2\x80\x9d  444 U. S., at 566.<em> </em>As the Court recognized in <em>Ford Motor Credit Co.</em>, twice since the passage of TILA, Congress has made this intention clear: first by providing a good-faith defense to creditors who comply with the Board\xe2\x80\x99s rules and regulations, 88 Stat. 1518, codified at 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71640(f), and, second, by expanding this good-faith defense to creditors who conform to \xe2\x80\x9cany interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals,\xe2\x80\x9d 90 Stat. 197, codified as amended, at \xc2\xa71640(f).  444 U.

Thus, in determining whether Regulation Z\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s text is binding on the courts, we are faced with only two questions.  We first ask whether \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842 (1984).  If so, courts, as well as the agency, \xe2\x80\x9cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 842\xe2\x80\x93843<em>.</em>  However, whenever Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency\xe2\x80\x99s regulation is \xe2\x80\x9cgiven controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 843\xe2\x80\x93844.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TILA itself does not explicitly address whether over-limit fees are included within the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress defined \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9call charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71605(a).  The Court of Appeals, however, made no attempt to clarify the scope of the critical term \xe2\x80\x9cincident to the extension of credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals recognized that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]n ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 529\xe2\x80\x93530 (quoting <em>K mart Corp.</em> v. <em>Cartier, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/281/index.html">486 U. S. 281</a>, 291 (1988)).  However, the Court of Appeals failed to examine TILA\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions, or even the surrounding language in \xc2\xa71605, before reaching its conclusion.   Because petitioners would not have imposed the over-limit fee had they not \xe2\x80\x9cgranted [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] request for additional credit, which resulted in her exceeding her credit limit,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals held that the over-limit fee in this case fell squarely within \xc2\xa71605(a)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  295 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 528\xe2\x80\x93529.  Thus, the Court of Appeals rested its holding primarily on its particular characterization of the transaction that led to the over-limit charge in this case.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the transaction in this case, however, is not supported even by the facts as set forth in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  Respondent alleged in her complaint that the over-limit fee is imposed for each month in which her balance exceeds the original credit limit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A39, \xc2\xb6  ;35.  If this were true, however, the over-limit fee would be imposed not as a direct result of an extension of credit for a purchase that caused respondent to exceed her $2,000 limit, but rather as a result of the fact that her charges exceeded her $2,000 limit at the time respondent\xe2\x80\x99s monthly charges were officially calculated.  Because over-limit fees, regardless of a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s particular billing practices, are imposed only when a consumer exceeds his credit limit, it is perfectly reasonable to characterize an over-limit fee not as a charge imposed for obtaining an extension of credit over a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit limit, but rather as a penalty for violating the credit agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thus erred in resting its conclusion solely on this particular characterization of the details of credit card transactions, a characterization that is not clearly compelled by the terms and definitions of TILA, and one with which others could reasonably disagree.  Certainly, regardless of how the fee is characterized, there is at least some connection between the over-limit fee and an extension of credit.  But, this Court has recognized that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincident to or in conjunction with\xe2\x80\x9d implies some <em>necessary</em> connection between the antecedent and its object, although it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not place beyond rational debate the nature or extent of the required connection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holly Farms Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/392/index.html">517 U. S. 392</a>, 403, n. 9 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincident to\xe2\x80\x9d does not make clear whether a substantial (as opposed to a remote) connection is required.  Thus, unlike the Court of Appeals, we cannot conclude that the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d unambiguously includes over-limit fees.  That term, standing alone, is ambiguous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, an examination of TILA\xe2\x80\x99s related provisions, as well as the full text of \xc2\xa71605 itself, casts doubt on the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the statute.  A consumer holding an open-end credit plan may incur two types of charges\xe2\x80\x94finance charges and \xe2\x80\x9cother charges which may be imposed as part of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71637(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(5).  TILA does not make clear which charges fall into each category.  But TILA\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of at least two categories of charges does make clear that Congress did not contemplate that <em>all</em> charges made in connection with an open-end credit plan would be considered \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  And where TILA does explicitly address over-limit fees, it defines them as fees imposed \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with an extension of credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71637(c)(1)(B)(iii), rather than \xe2\x80\x9cincident to the extension of credit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71605(a).  Furthermore, none of \xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x99s specific examples of charges that fall within the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d includes over-limit or comparable fees.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71605(a)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9c[s]ervice or carrying charge\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71605(a)(3) (loan fee or similar charge); \xc2\xa71605(a)(6) (mortgage broker fees).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As our prior discussion indicates, the best interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d may exclude over-limit fees.  But \xc2\xa71605(a) is, at best, ambiguous, because neither \xc2\xa71605(a) nor its surrounding provisions provides a clear answer.  While we acknowledge that there may be some fees not explicitly addressed by \xc2\xa71605(a)\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d but which are unambiguously included in or excluded by that definition, over-limit fees are not such fees.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa71605 is ambiguous, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s regulation implementing \xc2\xa71605 \xe2\x80\x9cis binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

Regulation Z defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of consumer credit.\xe2\x80\x9d  12 CFR \xc2\xa7226.4 (2004).

Reg. 80 649 (1980).  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to emphasize disclosures that are most relevant to a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s initial credit decisions reflects an understanding that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[m]eaningful</em> disclosure does not mean <em>more</em> disclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cdescribes a balance between \xe2\x80\x98competing considerations of complete disclosure \xe2\x80\xa6 and the need to avoid \xe2\x80\xa6 [informational overload].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ford Motor Credit Co.</em>, 444 U. S., at 568 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 96\xe2\x80\x9373, p.\xc2\xa03 (1979)).  Although the fees excluded from the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d in Regulation Z (<em>e.g.,</em> application charges, late payment charges, and over-limit fees) might be relevant to a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit decision, the Board rationally concluded that these fees\xe2\x80\x94which are not automatically recurring or are imposed only when a consumer defaults on a credit agreement\xe2\x80\x94are less relevant to determining the true cost of credit.  Because over-limit fees, which are imposed only when a consumer breaches the terms of his credit agreement, can reasonably be characterized as a penalty for defaulting on the credit agreement, the Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to exclude them from the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d is surely reasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that Regulation Z conflicts with \xc2\xa71605\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals ignored our warning that \xe2\x80\x9cjudges ought to refrain from substituting their own interstitial lawmaking for that of the [Board].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ford Motor Credit Co.,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 568<em>.</em>  Despite the Board\xe2\x80\x99s rational decision to adopt a uniform rule excluding from the term \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d <em>all</em> penalties imposed for exceeding the credit limit, the Court of Appeals adopted a case-by-case approach contingent on whether an act of default was \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  Putting aside the lack of textual support for this approach, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach would prove unworkable to creditors and, more importantly, lead to significant confusion for consumers.  Under the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule, a consumer would be able to decipher if a charge is considered a \xe2\x80\x9cfinance charge\xe2\x80\x9d or an \xe2\x80\x9cother charge\xe2\x80\x9d each month only by recalling the details of the particular transaction that caused the consumer to exceed his credit limit.  In most cases, the consumer would not even know the relevant facts, which are contingent on the nature of the authorization given by the creditor to the merchant.  Moreover, the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cunilateral\xe2\x80\x9d acts of default and acts of default where a consumer exceeds his credit limit (but has not thereby renegotiated his credit limit and is still subject to the over-limit fee) is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the workings of the credit card industry.  As the Board explained below, a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthorization\xe2\x80\x9d of a particular point-of-sale transaction does not represent a final determination that a particular transaction is within a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s credit limit because the authorization system is not suited to identify instantaneously and accurately over-limit transactions.
