The Court of Criminal Appeals, in an original proceeding brought by petitioner, also refused to order that petitioner be provided a copy at public expense.  The court agreed with the trial court that no Oklahoma statute or Oklahoma City ordinance authorized such an order, and held further that the Fourteenth Amendment did not mandate</p>\n<p>"that an indigent person, convicted for a violation of a city ordinance, quasi-criminal in nature and often referred to as a petty offense, is entitled to a case-made or transcript at city expense in order to perfect an appeal from said conviction."</p>\n<p>439 P.2d 965 (1968).  We granted certiorari.  393 U.S. 998 (1968).  We reverse.</p>\n<p>"This Court has never held that the States are required to establish avenues of appellate review, but it is now fundamental that, once established, these avenues must be kept free of unreasoned distinctions that can only impede open and equal access to the courts.  <em>Griffin v.

JUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.</p>\n<p>* The pertinent Oklahoma statutes provide as follows:</p>\n<p>Okla.Stat.Ann., Tit. 22, \xc2\xa7 1059 (1958):</p>\n<p>"In all criminal cases appealable to the Criminal Court of Appeals, the appellant may prepare, and it shall be the duty of the court to provide for the preparation and settling of a case-made in all respects as in civil cases, and the case-made so settled, served and filed in the trial court may be sent to the appellate court in lieu of all other records or bills of exception; or the proceeding in the appellate court may be as provided in the next section."</p>\n<p>Okla.Stat.Ann., Tit. 22, \xc2\xa7 1060 (Supp. 1968):</p>\n<p>"Instead of the appeal hereinbefore provided for, any party desiring to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals in any criminal case may proceed by case made and petition in error by filing notice of such intent and by making request for case made, both to be made in writing, in open court, either at the time the judgment is rendered, or within ten days thereafter.  In such an appeal the case made must be settled and served and the appeal lodged within the time for such appeal as hereinbefore set out.  Instead of the case made plaintiff in error may attach to his petition in error a transcript of the proceedings of record in the trial court."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
