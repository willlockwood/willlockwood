The Second Circuit held that a court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over interlocutory orders in bankruptcy only when a district court issues the order after having withdrawn a proceeding or case from a bankruptcy court, and not when the district court acts in its capacity as a bankruptcy court of appeals. We granted certiorari, 502 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 1292. * CNB contends that \xc2\xa7 1292(b) applies by its terms in this case, and that the Second Circuit therefore could have exercised discretionary jurisdiction over its appeal. Germain argues that \xc2\xa7 1292 does not apply at all in this case because Congress limited \xc2\xa7 1292 through 28 U. S. C.</p><p>*That section provides in relevant part:</p><p>"(a) ...

CNB responds that nothing in \xc2\xa7 158(d) limits \xc2\xa7 1292. We agree with CNB.</p><p>Bankruptcy appeals are governed for the most part by \xc2\xa7 158. This section comprises four subsections, three of which concern us here. Subsection (a) gives the district courts authority to hear appeals from final and interlocutory orders of the bankruptcy courts. The District Court, as we have noted, had jurisdiction under this provision to hear CNB\'s appeal from the Bankruptcy Court. Subsection (b) permits the judicial council of any circuit to establish a bankruptcy appellate panel to fill the role of the district courts under subsection (a). Subsection (d), which is pivotal in this case, provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees entered under subsections (a) and (b) of this section."</p></blockquote><p>N either this subsection nor any other part of \xc2\xa7 158 mentions interlocutory orders entered by the district courts in bankruptcy. The parties agree, as they must, that \xc2\xa7 158 did not confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.</p><p>Germain contends that the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1292 either, for \xc2\xa7 158(d), in his view, precludes jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1292 by negative implication. Germain reasons as follows: Although \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1291 and 1292 appear to cover the universe of decisions issued by the district courts-with \xc2\xa7 1291 conferring jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts, and \xc2\xa7 1292 conferring jurisdiction over certain interlocutory ones-that cannot in fact be so. If \xc2\xa7 1291 did cover all final decisions by a district court, he argues, that section would render \xc2\xa7 158(d) superfluous, since a final decision issued by a district court sitting as a bankruptcy appellate court is still a final decision of a district court. If \xc2\xa7 158(d) is to have effect, Germain contends, then that section must be exclusive within its own</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="253">253</a></p><p>domain, which he defines as the universe of orders issued by district courts sitting pursuant to \xc2\xa7 158(a) as courts of appeals in bankruptcy. When a district court enters an order in that capacity, Germain concludes, only \xc2\xa7 158(d) can confer jurisdiction, and if it does not, nothing else can. Germain claims to find support for his view in his reading of the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 158(d).</p><p>Contrary to Germain\'s contention, we need not choose between giving effect on the one hand to \xc2\xa7 1291 and on the other to \xc2\xa7 158(d), for the statutes do not pose an either-or proposition. Section 1291 confers jurisdiction over appeals from "final decisions of the district courts" acting in any capacity. Section 158(d), in contrast, confers jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts when they act as bankruptcy appellate courts under \xc2\xa7 158(a), and also confers jurisdiction over final decisions of the appellate panels in bankruptcy acting under \xc2\xa7 158(b). Sections 1291 and 158(d) do overlap, therefore, but each section confers jurisdiction over cases that the other section does not reach.</p><p>Redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting, and so long as there is no "positive repugnancy" between two laws, <i>Wood </i>v. <i>United States, </i>16 Pet. 342, 363 (1842), a court must give effect to both. Because giving effect to both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1291 and 158(d) would not render one or the other wholly superfluous, we do not have to read \xc2\xa7 158(d) as precluding courts of appeals, by negative implication, from exercising jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1291 over district courts sitting in bankruptcy. We similarly do not have to read \xc2\xa7 158(d) as precluding jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1292. While courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous, in this case that canon does not apply.</p><p>In any event, canons of construction are no more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of legislation, and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others. We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="254">254</a></p><p>legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/case.html">489 U. S. 235</a>, 241-242 (1989); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Goldenberg, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/168/95/case.html">168 U. S. 95</a>, 102-103 (1897); <i>Oneale </i>v. <i>Thornton, </i>6 Cranch 53, 68 (1810). When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: "judicial inquiry is complete." <i>Rubin </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/case.html">449 U. S. 424</a>, 430 (1981); see also <i>Ron Pair Enterprises, supra, </i>at 241.</p><p>Germain says that legislative history points to a different result. But we think that judicial inquiry into the applicability of \xc2\xa7 1292 begins and ends with what \xc2\xa7 1292 does say and with what \xc2\xa7 158(d) does not. Section 1292 provides for review in the courts of appeals, in certain circumstances, of "[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States." Section 158(d) is silent as to review of interlocutory orders. Nowhere does \xc2\xa7 1292 limit review to orders issued by district courts sitting as trial courts in bankruptcy rather than appellate courts, and nowhere else, whether in \xc2\xa7 158(d) or any other statute, has Congress indicated that the unadorned words of \xc2\xa7 1292 are in some way limited by implication. "It would be dangerous in the extreme to infer ... that a case for which the words of an instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted from its operation." <i>Sturges </i>v. <i>Crowninshield, </i>4 Wheat. 122, 202 (1819); see also <i>Regents of Univ. ofCal. </i>v. <i>Public Employment Relations Bd., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/589/case.html">485 U. S. 589</a>, 598 (1988). There is no reason to infer from either \xc2\xa7 1292 or \xc2\xa7 158(d) that Congress meant to limit appellate review of interlocutory orders in bankruptcy proceedings. So long as a party to a proceeding or case in bankruptcy meets the conditions imposed by \xc2\xa7 1292, a court of appeals may rely on that statute as a basis for jurisdiction.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="255">255</a></p><p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>Whenever there is some uncertainty about the meaning of a statute, it is prudent to examine its legislative history.l In this case, such an examination is appropriate because petitioner\'s interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 158(d) creates an unusual overlap with 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1291.</p><p>Rejecting petitioner\'s position, the Court of Appeals concluded that in enacting the current system of bankruptcy appeals, Congress limited the scope of \xc2\xa7 1292(b), excluding review by the courts of appeals of certain interlocutory bankruptcy orders. If Congress had intended such a significant change in the scheme of appellate jurisdiction, some indication of this purpose would almost certainly have found its way into the legislative history. The legislative record, however, contains no mention of an intent to limit the scope of \xc2\xa7 1292(b). This silence tends to support the conclusion that no such change was intended.2</p><p>Accordingly, notwithstanding the inferences drawn by the Court of Appeals, the legislative history is not only consist-</p><p>lSee <i>Wisconsin Public Intervenor </i>v. <i>Mortier </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html">501 U.

As Judge Learned Hand advised, statutes "should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them." <i>Lehigh Valley Coal Co. </i>v. <i>Yensavage, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F5/218/7/">218 F.5d 7</a>, 553 <i>(CA2 </i>1914), cert. denied, 235 U.

Similarly, Justice Frankfurter\'s scholarly observation concerning the interpretation of a statutory text also applies to the analysis of legislative history: "One must ... listen attentively to what it does not say."

For this reason, and because I agree with the Court\'s textual analysis, I concur in its judgment.</p><p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>I agree that when Congress enacted 28 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 158(d) as part of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Congress probably did not intend to deprive the courts of appeals of their longstanding jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases. But I think we should admit that this construction of the statutes <i>does </i>render \xc2\xa7 158(d) largely superfluous, and that we <i>do </i>strive to interpret statutes so as to avoid redundancy. Cf. <i>ante, </i>at 253254. In this case, I think it far more likely that Congress inadvertently created a redundancy than that Congress intended to withdraw appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory bankruptcy appeals by the roundabout method of reconferring jurisdiction over appeals from final bankruptcy orders. I would reverse the judgment below only for this reason.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
