S. 280</a>, 284 (2005).  In this case, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 suit on the ground that they were in privity with a state-court loser.  We hold that the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not bar plaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is the latest of several rounds of litigation involving the State of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s congressional redistricting after the 2000 census, under which the State gained a seat in the House of Representatives.  <em>Lance</em> v. <em>Davidson</em>, 379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1117, 1121 (2005).  The first round began in May 2001.  When the Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado voters asked the state courts to create a plan.  The courts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the additional district.  See <em>Beauprez</em> v. <em> Avalos</em>, 42 P.\xc2\xa03d 642 (Colo. 2002) (en banc).  The 2002 elections were held using this court-ordered plan.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan in the spring of 2003, prompting further litigation\xe2\x80\x94this time about which electoral map was to govern, the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s or the court\xe2\x80\x99s.  Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s plan: an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the court-ordered plan.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1121.  After the Colorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the plan violated Article V, \xc2\xa744, of the State Constitution, which the court construed to limit congressional redistricting to \xe2\x80\x9conce per decade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People ex rel. Salazar</em> v. <em>Davidson, </em>79 P.\xc2\xa03d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc).  It therefore ordered the secretary of state to use the court-created plan.  We denied certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1093/index.html">541 U. S. 1093</a> (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second suit was removed to federal court by the defendants on the basis of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 federal-law claims.  See <em>Keller</em> v.<em> Davidson,</em> 299 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1171, 1175 (Colo. 2004).  Once <em>Salazar</em> was decided by the Colorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 counterclaims was the only remaining issue.  A three-judge District Court held that the defendants were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine from amending their counterclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision in <em>Salazar</em>.  It also held that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 original counterclaims, while not barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment in <em>Salazar</em>.  Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal in <em>Keller</em>, several Colorado citizens unhappy with <em>Salazar</em> filed an action in the District Court seeking to require the secretary of state to use the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s plan.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The plaintiffs argued that Article V, \xc2\xa744, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections Clause of Article I, \xc2\xa74, of the U. S. Constitution (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof\xe2\x80\x9d), and the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Petition Clause (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law \xe2\x80\xa6 abridging \xe2\x80\xa6 the right of the people \xe2\x80\xa6 to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\xe2\x80\x9d).  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on the Colorado Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Salazar</em> and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition Clause claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three-judge District Court ruled that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear the Elections Clause claim.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1127.  The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine, the court explained, includes three requirements: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe party against whom the doctrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court judgment or have been in privity with such a party\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cthe claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1124.  The District Court found the first requirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen plaintiffs were in privity with the Colorado General Assembly\xe2\x80\x94a losing party in <em>Salazar.  </em>Relying on our decisions in <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/443/658/index.html">443 U. S. 658</a> (1979), and <em>Tacoma</em> v. <em>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/320/index.html">357 U. S. 320</a> (1958), the court stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a state government litigates a matter of public concern, that state\xe2\x80\x99s citizens will be deemed to be in privity with the government for preclusion purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1125.  This principle, the court reasoned, applies \xe2\x80\x9cwith equal force in the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim was actually raised in <em>Salazar,</em> or inextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel to the claims presented in <em>Salazar</em>.  As to the Petition Clause claim, the court ruled that neither <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> nor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the merits, but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa012(b)(6).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs appealed.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.  We now note jurisdiction, and address whether the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding because they were in privity with a party in <em>Salazar</em>.  We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court is vested, under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257, with jurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments.  We have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive: \xe2\x80\x9cReview of such judgments may be had <em>only</em> in this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals</em> v. <em>Feldman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/462/index.html">460 U. S. 462</a>, 482 (1983) (emphasis added); see also <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</em> v. <em>Locomotive Engineers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/index.html">398 U. S. 281</a>, 286 (1970);<em> Rooker</em> v. <em>Fidelity Trust Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/263/413/index.html">263 U. S. 413</a>, 416 (1923).  Accordingly, under what has come to be known as the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have applied this rule to find that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction.  In <em>Rooker</em>, a party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state-court judgment.  We viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 U. S., at 416.  <em>Feldman</em>, decided 60 years later, concerned slightly different circumstances, with similar results.  The plaintiffs there had been refused admission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in federal district court.  Our decision held that to the extent plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselves\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94their sole avenue of review was with this Court.  460 U. S., at 476.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Rooker</em> nor <em>Feldman</em> elaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and our cases since <em>Feldman </em>have tended to emphasize the narrowness of the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> rule.  See <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U. S., at 292 (<em>Rooker-Feldman</em> does not apply to parallel state and federal litigation); <em>Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/635/index.html">535 U. S. 635</a>, 644, n. 3 (2002) (<em>Rooker-Feldman</em> \xe2\x80\x9chas no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>De Grandy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/997/index.html">512 U. S. 997</a>, 1005\xe2\x80\x931006 (1994) (<em>Rooker-Feldman</em> does not bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit).  Indeed, during that period, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court has never applied <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Exxon Mobil</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 287.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Exxon Mobil</em>, decided last Term, we warned that the lower courts have at times extended <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>\xe2\x80\x9cfar beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker</em> and <em>Feldman</em> cases, overriding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 283.  <em>Rooker-Feldman</em>, we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to \xe2\x80\x9ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 284.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have never addressed the precise question before us, we have held <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> inapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding.  See <em>De Grandy, supra,</em> at 1006.  In <em>De Grandy, </em>the State of Florida sought, using <em>Rooker-Feldman</em>, to prevent the United States from bringing a challenge under \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state electoral districts.  The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the state attorney general, had already declared the law valid under state and federal law.  We held that <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> did not bar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court because the United States \xe2\x80\x9cwas not a party in the state court,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwas in no position to ask this Court to review the state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 1006.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, plaintiffs were plainly not parties to the underlying state-court proceeding in <em>Salazar</em>.  <em>Salazar</em> was an action brought by the state attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado General Assembly intervened.  79 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 1227.  The four citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate in <em>Salazar</em>, and were not in a \xe2\x80\x9cposition to ask this Court to review the state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Grandy,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 1006; see <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>May,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/72/index.html">484 U. S. 72</a>, 77 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the District Court recognized the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Rooker-Feldman</em> may not be invoked against a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to the prior state-court judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d 379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1123, it nevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing application of <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> against parties who were in privity with a party to the earlier state-court action.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citing <em>Kenmen Eng.</em> v. <em>Union,</em> 314 F.\xc2\xa03d 468, 481 (2002)).  In determining whether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the preclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-court judgments.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citing <em>Washington,</em> 443 U. S., at 693, n.\xc2\xa032; <em>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</em> 357 U. S., at 340\xe2\x80\x93341).  It concluded that\xe2\x80\x94for <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> as well as preclusion purposes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe outcome of the government\xe2\x80\x99s litigation over a matter of public concern binds its citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1125.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law with <em>Rooker-Feldman</em>.  Whatever the impact of privity principles on preclusion rules, <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> is not simply preclusion by another name.  The doctrine applies only in \xe2\x80\x9climited circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Exxon Mobil</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court.  The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to the judgment.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A more expansive <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> rule would tend to supplant Congress\xe2\x80\x99 mandate, under the Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738, that federal courts \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baker</em> v. <em>General Motors Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/222/index.html">522 U. S. 222</a>, 246 (1998) (quoting <em>Kremer</em> v. <em>Chemical Constr. Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/index.html">456 U. S. 461</a>, 466 (1982)); see <em>Exxon Mobil, supra</em>, at 293.  Congress has directed federal courts to look principally to <em>state</em> law in deciding what effect to give state-court judgments.  Incorporation of preclusion principles into <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> risks turning that limited doctrine into a uniform <em>federal</em> rule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the secretary of state defended the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s plan in <em>Salazar</em>, following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to represent her.  379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1117, 1122, n.\xc2\xa03 (Colo. 2005).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In holding that <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> does not bar plaintiffs here from proceeding, we need not address whether there are <em>any</em> circumstances, however limited, in which <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>may be applied against a party not named in an earlier state proceeding\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, where an estate takes a <em>de facto</em> appeal in a district court of an earlier state decision involving the decedent.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> because they were in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party in<em> People ex rel.

As appellee points out, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 second question presented \xe2\x80\x9cis literally the same question presented by the General Assembly on <em>certiorari</em> review (and denied) in <em>Salazar</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Motion to Affirm 12.  And, as a matter of Colorado law, appellants are clearly in privity with both then-Colorado Attorney General Salazar, who brought the suit on behalf of the people of Colorado, and the Colorado General Assembly, which was also a party to the <em>Salazar</em> litigation.  See <em>McNichols </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver</em>, 101 Colo. 316, 322, 74 P.\xc2\xa02d 99, 102 (1937) (en banc) (finding privity between taxpayers seeking to challenge the validity of a bond issue and a public official \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with ministerial and executive duties in connection\xe2\x80\x9d with the issuance of the bonds who already brought such a suit); <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S.\xc2\xa0F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of County Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of County of Fremont</em>, 95 Colo. 435, 441, 37 P.\xc2\xa02d 761, 764 (1934) (en banc) (explaining that taxpayers are in privity with a political division of the State or its official representative if the case involves \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of general interest to all the people\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, all of the requirements under Colorado law for issue preclusion have been met, and appellants\xe2\x80\x99 Elections Clause claim should therefore be dismissed.  See generally 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738; <em>Michaelson </em>v. <em>Michaelson</em>, 884 P.\xc2\xa02d 695, 700\xe2\x80\x93701 (Colo. 1994) (setting forth requirements for issue preclusion under Colorado law).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 spurious Petition Clause claim was also properly dismissed by the District Court.  See 379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1130\xe2\x80\x931132.  Nothing in the Colorado Constitution prevents appellants from petitioning the Colorado General Assembly with their grievances, <em>id.</em>, at 1131; nothing in the United States Constitution guarantees that such a petition will be effective, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Highway Employees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/463/index.html">441 U. S. 463</a>, 465 (1979) <em>(per curiam);</em> see also <em>Minnesota State Bd. for Community Colleges</em> v. <em>Knight</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/271/index.html">465 U. S. 271</a>, 285 (1984).  Moreover, as the District Court recognized, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of the Petition Clause would lead to absurd results.  See 379 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1131\xe2\x80\x931132.  As such, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 Petition Clause claim was correctly dismissed because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  See generally Fed. Rule Civ.
