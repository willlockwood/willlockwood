Despite respondent wife\'s good faith efforts to determine the cause of the "double billing," she was unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation or any suggestion for further recourse from the utility\'s employees.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 by homeowners in Memphis, Tenn. seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against a municipal utility and several of its officers and employees for termination of utility service allegedly without due process of law.  The District Court determined that respondents\' claim of entitlement to continued utility service did not implicate a "property" interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and that, in any event, the utility\'s termination procedures comported with due process.  The Court of Appeals reversed in part.  We granted certiorari to consider this constitutional question of importance in the operation of municipal utilities throughout the Nation.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division (MLG&amp;W) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] is a division of the city of Memphis which provides utility service.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 436 U. S. 4</a></p><p> It is directed by a Board of Commissioners appointed by the City Council, and is subject to the ultimate control of the municipal government.  As a municipal utility, MLG&amp;W enjoys a statutory exemption from regulation by the state public service commission.  Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1306, 1317 (19,71).</p>\n<p>Willie S. and Mary Craft, respondents here, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] reside at 1019 Alaska Street in Memphis.  When the Crafts moved into their residence in October, 1972, they noticed that there were two separate gas and electric meters and only one water meter serving the premises.  The residence had been used previously as a duplex.  The Crafts assumed, on the basis of information from the seller, that the second set of meters was inoperative.</p>\n<p>In 1973, the Crafts began receiving two bills:  their regular bill, and a second bill with an account number in the name of Willie C. Craft, as opposed to Willie S. Craft.  Separate monthly bills were received for each set of meters, with a city service fee [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] appearing on each bill.  In October, 1973, after learning from a MLG&amp;W meter reader that both sets of meters were running in their home, the Crafts hired a private plumber and electrical contractor to combine the meters into one gas and one electric meter.  Because the contractor did not consolidate the meters properly, a condition of which the Crafts were not aware, they continued to receive two bills until January, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 436 U. S. 5</a></p><p> 1974.  During this period, the Crafts\' utility service was terminated five times for nonpayment.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, Mrs. Craft missed work and went to the MLG&amp;W offices in order to resolve the "double billing" problem.  As found by the District Court, Mrs. Craft sought in good faith to determine the cause of the "double billing," but was unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation or any suggestion for further recourse from MLG&amp;W employees.  The court noted:</p>\n<p>"On one occasion when Mrs. Craft was attempting to avert a utilities termination, after final notice, she called the defendant\'s offices and explained that she had paid a bill, but was given no satisfaction.  The procedure for an opportunity to talk with management was not adequately explained to Mrs. Craft, although she repeatedly tried to get some explanation for the problems of two bills and possible duplicate charges."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. 339.</p>\n<p>In February, 1974, the Crafts and other MLG&amp;W customers filed this action in the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.  After trial, the District Court refused to certify the plaintiffs\' class and rendered judgment for the defendants.  Although the court apparently was of the view that plaintiffs had no property interest in continued utility service while a disputed bill remained unpaid, it nevertheless addressed the procedural due process issue.  It acknowledged that respondents had not been given adequate notice of a procedure for discussing the disputed bills with management, but concluded that</p>\n<p>"[n]one of the individual plaintiffs [was] deprived of [a] due process opportunity to be heard, nor did the circumstances indicate any substantial deprivation except in the possible instance of Mr. and Mrs. Craft."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 45. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="6">Page 436 U. S. 6</a></p><p> expressed "hope," "whether on the principles of [pendent] jurisdiction, or on the basis of a very limited possible denial of due process to Mr. and Mrs. Craft," that credit in the amount of $35 be issued to reimburse the Crafts for</p>\n<p>"duplicate and unnecessary charges made and expenses </p><p><a class="page-number" name="7">Page 436 U. S. 7</a></p><p> incurred by [them] with respect to terminations which should have been unnecessary had effectual relief been afforded them as requested."</p>\n<p>The court also recommended "that MLG&amp;W in the future send a certified or registered mail notice of termination at least four days prior to termination," and that such notice</p>\n<p>"provide more specific information about customer service locations and personnel available to work out extended payment plans or adjustments of accounts in genuine hardships or appropriate situations."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 46-47. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s refusal to certify a class action, but held that the procedures accorded to the Crafts did not comport with due process.  534 F.2d 684 (1976).</p>\n<p>On July 12, 1976, petitioners sought a writ of certiorari in this Court to determine (i) whether the termination policies of a municipal utility constitute "state action" under the Fourteenth Amendment; (ii) if so, whether a municipal utility\'s termination of service for nonpayment deprives a customer of "property" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause; and (iii) assuming "state action" and a "property" interest, whether MLG&amp;W\'s procedures afforded due process of law in this case. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  On February 22, 1977, we granted certiorari.  429 U.S. 1090.  We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>There is, at the outset, a question of mootness.  Although the parties have not addressed this question in their briefs,</p>\n<p>"they may not, by stipulation, invoke the judicial power of the United States in litigation which does not present an actual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="8">Page 436 U. S. 8</a></p><p> \'case or controversy,\' <em>Richardson v. Ramirez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/418/24/case.html">418 U. S. 24</a></span> (1974). . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Sosna v.

S. 398</a></span> (1975).</p>\n<p>As the case comes to us, the only remaining plaintiffs are respondents Willie S. and Mary Craft.  Since the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s refusal to certify a class, the existence of a continuing "case or controversy" depends entirely on the claims of respondents.  <em>Cf. Sosna v. Iowa, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/393/case.html#399">419 U. S. 399</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/393/case.html#402">419 U. S. 402</a></span>.  It appears that respondents no longer desire a hearing to resolve a continuing dispute over their bills, as the double-meter problem has been clarified during this litigation. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Nor do respondents aver that there is a present threat of termination of service.</p>\n<p>"An injunction can issue only after the plaintiff has established that the conduct sought to be enjoined is illegal and that the defendant, if not enjoined, will engage in such conduct."</p>\n<p><em>United Transportation Union v. Michigan Bar,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/576/case.html">401 U.

Respondents insist, however, that the case is not moot, because they seek damages and declaratory relief and because the dispute that occasioned this suit is "capable of repetition, yet evading review."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 456.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether this case falls within the special rule developed in <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/219/498/case.html">219 U. S. 498</a></span> (1911); <em>see Moore v.

S. 125</a></span> (1973), to permit consideration of questions which, by their very nature, are not likely to survive the course of a normal litigation.  Respondents\' claim for actual and punitive damages arising from MLG&amp;W\'s terminations of service saves this cause from the bar of mootness.  <em>Cf. Powell v. McCormack,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/486/case.html">395 U.

Although we express no opinion as to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="9">Page 436 U. S. 9</a></p><p> validity of respondents\' claim for damages, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] that claim is not so insubstantial or so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that this case may not proceed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment places procedural constraints on the actions of government that work a deprivation of interests enjoying the stature of "property" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.  Although the underlying substantive interest is created by "an independent source such as state law," federal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a "legitimate claim of entitlement" protected by the Due Process Clause.  <em>Board of Regents v. Roth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html">408 U. S. 564</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html#577">408 U.

In defining a public utility\'s privilege to terminate for nonpayment of proper charges, Tennessee decisional law draws a line between utility bills that are the subject of a bona fide dispute and those that are not.</p>\n<p>"A company supplying electricity to the public has a right to cut off service to a customer for nonpayment of a just service bill, and the company may adopt a rule to that effect.  Annot., 112 A.L.R. 237 (1938).  An exception </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 436 U. S. 10</a></p><p> to the general rule exists when the customer has a bona fide dispute concerning the correctness of the bill.  <em>Steele v. Clinton Electric Light &amp; Power Co.,</em> 12 Conn.180, 193 A. 613, 615 (1937); Annot., 112 A.L.R. 237, 241 (1938); <em>see also</em> 43 Am.Jur., Public Utilities and Services, Sec. 65; Annot., 28 A.L.R. 475 (1924).  If the public utility discontinues service for nonpayment of a disputed amount, it does so at its peril, and if the public utility was wrong (<em>e.g.,</em> customer overcharged), it is liable for damages.  <em>Sims v. Alabama Water Co.,</em> 205 Ala. 378, 87 So. 688, 690, 28 A.L.R. 461 (1920)."</p>\n<p><em>Trigg v. Middle Tennessee Electric Membership Cop.,</em> 533 S.W.2d 730, 733 (Tenn.App. 1975), <em>cert. denied</em> (Tenn.Sup.Ct. Mar. 15, 1976). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The <em>Trigg</em> court also rejected the utility\'s argument that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the utility\'s rules and regulations, which required payment whether or not a bill is received.  "A public utility should not be able to coerce a customer to pay a disputed claim."  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 436 U. S. 11</a></p><p></p>\n<p>State law does not permit a public utility to terminate service "at will."  <em>Cf. Bishop v. Wood,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html">426 U. S. 341</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html#345">426 U. S. 345347</a></span> (1976).  MLG&amp;W and other public utilities in Tennessee are obligated to provide service "to all of the inhabitants of the city of its location alike, without discrimination, and without denial, except for good and sufficient cause," <em>Farmer v. Nashville,</em> 127 Tenn. 509, 515, 156 S.W. 189, 190 (1913), and may not terminate service except "for nonpayment of a just service bill," <em>Trigg,</em> 533 S.W.2d at 733.  An aggrieved customer may be able to enjoin a wrongful threat to terminate, or to bring a subsequent action for damages or a refund.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The availability of such local law remedies is evidence of the State\'s recognition of a protected interest.  Although the customer\'s right to continued service is conditioned upon payment of the charges properly due, "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment\'s protection of <em>property\' . . . has never been interpreted to safeguard only the rights of undisputed ownership."  <em>Fuentes v. Shevin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html">407 U. S. 67</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/67/case.html#86">407 U.

The issue here is whether due process requires that a municipal utility notify the customer of the availability of an avenue of redress within the organization should he wish to contest a particular charge.</p>\n<p>The "final notice" contained in MLG&amp;W\'s bills simply stated that payment was overdue and that service would be discontinued if payment was not made by a certain date.  As the Court of Appeals determined, "the MLG&amp;W notice only warn[ed] the customer to pay or face termination."  534 F.2d at 688-689.  MLG&amp;W also enclosed a "flyer" with the "final notice."  One "flyer" was distributed to about 40% of the utility\'s customers, who resided in areas serviced by "credit counseling stations."  It stated in part:</p>\n<p>"If you are having difficulty paying your utility bill, bring your bill to our neighborhood credit counselors for assistance.  Your utility bills may be paid here also."</p>\n<p>No mention was made of a procedure for the disposition of a disputed claim.  A different "flyer" went to customers in the remaining areas.  It stated:</p>\n<p>"If you are having difficulty paying your utility bill and would like to discuss a utility payment plan, or if there is any dispute concerning the amount due, bring your bill to the office at . . . , or phone. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 688 n. 4.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals noted that "there is no assurance that the Crafts were mailed the just mentioned flyer," <em>ibid.,</em> and implicitly affirmed the District Court\'s finding that Mrs. Craft was never apprised of the availability of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 436 U. S. 14</a></p><p> procedure for discussing her dispute "with management." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The District Court\'s description of Mrs. Craft\'s repeated efforts to obtain information about what appeared to be unjustified double billing -- "good faith efforts to pay for [the Crafts\'] utilities as well as to straighten out the problem" -- makes clear that she was not adequately notified of the procedures asserted to have been available at the time. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' notification procedure, while adequate to apprise the Crafts of the threat of termination of service, was not "reasonably calculated" to inform them of the availability of "an opportunity to present their objections" to their bills.  <em>Mullane v.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that due process requires the provision of an opportunity for the presentation to a designated employee of a customer\'s complaint that he is being overcharged or charged for services not rendered.

S. 334</a></span>-335.</p>\n<p>Under the balancing approach outlined in <em>Mathews,</em> some administrative procedure for entertaining customer complaints prior to termination is required to afford reasonable assurance against erroneous or arbitrary withholding of essential services.  The customer\'s interest is self-evident.  Utility service is a necessity of modern life; indeed, the discontinuance of water or heating for even short periods of time may threaten health and safety.  And the risk of an erroneous deprivation, given the necessary reliance on computers, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] is not insubstantial. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The utility\'s interests are not incompatible with affording the notice and procedure described above.  Quite apart from its duty as a public service company, a utility -- in its own business interests -- may be expected to make all reasonable efforts to minimize billing errors and the resulting customer dissatisfaction and possible injury.  <em>Cf. Goss v. Lopez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html">419 U. S. 565</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/565/case.html#583">419 U. S. 583</a></span> (1975).  Nor should "some kind of hearing" prove burdensome.  The opportunity for a meeting with a responsible employee empowered to resolve the dispute could be afforded well in advance of the scheduled date of termination. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  And petitioners would retain the option to terminate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 436 U. S. 19</a></p><p> service after affording this opportunity and concluding that the amount billed was justly due.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that the available common law remedies of a pre-termination injunction, a post-termination suit for damages, and post-payment action for a refund are sufficient to cure any perceived inadequacy in MLG&amp;W\'s procedures. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, due process of law requires an opportunity for "some kind of hearing" prior to the deprivation of a significant property interest.  <em>See Boddie v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/case.html">401 U. S. 371</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/case.html#379">401 U. S. 379</a></span> (1971).  On occasion, this Court has recognized that, where the potential length or severity of the deprivation does not indicate a likelihood of serious loss and where the procedures underlying the decision to act are sufficiently reliable to minimize the risk of erroneous determination, government may act without providing additional "advance procedural safeguards," <em>Ingraham v. Wright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html">430 U. S. 651</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html#680">430 U. S. 680</a></span> (1977); <em>see Mathews v.

[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 436 U. S. 20</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The factors that have justified exceptions to the requirement of some prior process are not present here.  Although utility service may be restored ultimately, the cessation of essential services for any appreciable time works a uniquely final deprivation.  <em>Cf. Stanley v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html">405 U. S. 645</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html#647">405 U. S. 647</a></span>-648 (1972).  Moreover, the probability of error in utility cutoff decisions is not so insubstantial as to warrant dispensing with all process prior to termination. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>The injunction remedy referred to by petitioners would not be an adequate substitute for a pre-termination review of the disputed bill with a designated employee.  Many of the Court\'s decisions in this area have required additional procedures to further due process, notwithstanding the apparent availability of injunctive relief or recovery provisions.  It was thought that such remedies were likely to be too bounded by procedural constraints and too susceptible of delay to provide an effective safeguard against an erroneous deprivation. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  These considerations are applicable in the utility termination context. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 436 U. S. 21</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Equitable remedies are particularly unsuited to the resolution of factual disputes typically involving sums of money too small to justify engaging counsel or bringing a lawsuit. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  An action in equity to halt an improper termination, because it is less likely to be pursued [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and less likely to be effective even if pursued, will not provide the same assurance of accurate decisionmaking as would an adequate administrative procedure.  In these circumstances, an informal administrative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 436 U. S. 22</a></p><p> remedy, along the lines suggested above, constitutes the process that is "due."</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because of the failure to provide notice reasonably calculated to apprise respondents of the availability of an administrative procedure to consider their complaint of erroneous billing, and the failure to afford them an opportunity to present their complaint to a designated employee empowered to review disputed bills and rectify error, petitioners deprived respondents of an interest in property without due process of law.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Although MLG&amp;W is listed as one of the petitioners, the District Court dismissed the action as to the utility itself because "a municipality or governmental unit standing in that capacity is not a <em>person\' within the meaning" of \xc2\xa7 1983.  Pet. for Cert. 43.  The Court of Appeals did not disturb that determination, and respondents have not sought review of the point in this Court.  The individual petitioners, who are sued in both their official and personal capacities, are the utility\'s president and general manager, vice-president, members of the Board of Commissioners, and two employees who have had responsibility for terminating utility services.  They will be referred to throughout as either "MLG&amp;W" or "petitioners."\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Of those who brought the original action, only the Crafts remain.  The parties have not sought review in this Court of the rulings made below with respect to the other plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The city service fee is a separate item on the regular utility bill, as required by municipal ordinance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s conclusion was advanced with little explanation, other than a reference to MLG&amp;W\'s credit extension program.  In an earlier discussion, the opinion offered a description of the utility\'s procedures.  First, the court listed the steps involved in a termination:  (i) Approximately four days after a meter reading date, a bill is mailed to the service location or other address designated by the customer.  The last day to pay the net amount would be approximately 20 days after the meter reading date.  (ii) Approximately 24 days after the meters are read, a "final notice" is mailed stating that services will be disconnected within four days if no payment is received or other provision for payment is made.  (iii) Electric service is then terminated by the meter reader, unless the customer assures him that payment is in the mail, shows a paid receipt, or explains that nonpayment was due to illness.  If there is no communication prior to termination, the meter reader or serviceman is instructed to leave a cutoff notice giving information about restoration of service.  (iv) Approximately five days after the electric service cutoff, the remaining services are terminated if the customer has not paid the bill or made other arrangements for payment.  Pet. for Cert. 34-36.</p>\n<p>The court also noted that, on or about March 1, 1973, MLG&amp;W instituted an "extended payment plan."  This generous program allows customers able to demonstrate financial hardship to pay only one-half of a past-due bill, with the balance to be paid in equal installments over the next three bills.  The plaintiffs in this action were participants in the plan.  <em>Id.</em> at 36.</p>\n<p>Finally, the court observed that MLG&amp;W provided a procedure for resolution of disputed bills:</p>\n<p>"Credit counselors assist customers who have difficulty with payments or disputes concerning their bills with MLG&amp;W.  If those counselors cannot satisfy the customer, then the customer is referred to management personnel, generally, the chief clerk in the department; then the supervisor in credit and collection.  In addition, a dissatisfied customer may appeal to the Board of Commissioners of MLG&amp;W as to complaint regarding bills, service, termination of service or any other matter relating to the operation of the Division.  A customer may, if he so desires, be accompanied by an appropriate representative.  The billing of customers, the determination as to when a final notice is sent, and the termination of service [are] governed by policies, rules and regulations adopted and approved by the Board of Commissioners of MLG&amp;W."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 36-37.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>In its order filed on December 30, 1974, the court acknowledged that defendants had issued the recommended credit and "instituted some new procedures which will give more definitive and adequate notice to customers of possible or impending cut-off of services."  <em>Id.</em> at 49.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F16" name="T16">n</a> 16, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners have abandoned their contention that "state action" is not present in this case.  Brief for Petitioners 44.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>"Not until after the action was filed were the Crafts able to discover that they continued to receive double computer billings because MLG&amp;W failed to combine the two accounts properly (A. 146-150), or that, as a result of the double computer billings, MLG&amp;W had overcharged them for gas service and city service fees."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondents 5.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court found that,</p>\n<p>"[o]f the balance claimed by MLG&amp;W in March, 1974, some involved possible gas overcharges and double or duplicate billings with respect to city service fees."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. 39.  Presumably, respondents also seek recovery for the loss of pay occasioned by Mrs. Craft\'s several visits to the offices of MLG&amp;W "which should have been unnecessary had effectual relief been afforded them as requested."  <em>Id.</em> at 46.</p>\n<p>While not urging mootness, petitioners assert that their compliance with the District Court\'s recommendation that a $35 credit be issued to the Crafts removes any claim for damages from this case.  We do not understand the District Court\'s suggestion to have been an award of damages.  The validity of the damages claim is a matter for initial determination by the courts below.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Tennessee\'s formulation of a public utility\'s privilege to terminate service for nonpayment of an undisputed charge is in accord with the common law rule.  <em>See generally</em> 64 Am.Jur.2d Public Utilities \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 63-64 (1972); Annot., 112 A.L.R. 237, 241 (1938); Note, The Duty of a Public Utility to Render Adequate Service:  Its Scope and Enforcement, 62 Colum.L.Rev. 312, 326 (1962).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners attempt to avoid the force of <em>Trigg</em> by referring to several Tennessee decisions which state the general rule that a utility may terminate service for nonpayment of undisputed charges or noncompliance with reasonable rules and regulations.  These authorities, however, do not cast doubt upon the exception recognized in <em>Trigg</em> for a customer who tenders the undisputed amount, but withholds complete payment because of a bona fide dispute.  <em>See Patterson v. Chattanooga,</em> 192 Tenn. 267, 241 S.W.2d 291 (1951); <em>Farmer v. Nashville,</em> 127 Tenn. 509, 156 S.W. 189 (1913); <em>Jones v. Nashville,</em> 109 Tenn. 560, 72 S.W. 985 (1903); <em>Cruley v.

There, the Court upheld an Oregon statute that required a tenant seeking a continuance of an eviction hearing to post security for accruing rent during the continuance, and limited the issues triable in an eviction proceeding to the questions of physical possession, forcible withholding, and legal right to possession.  This reliance is misplaced.  First, the Court merely held that the Oregon procedures comported with due process, without intimating that a tenant\'s claim to continued possession during a rent dispute failed to implicate a "property" interest.

In the particular circumstances of a threat to discontinue utility service, the homeowner should not be left in the plight described by the District Court in this case.  Indeed, the dissent\'s view identifies the constitutional flaw in petitioners\' notice procedure.  The Crafts were told that, unless the double bills were paid by a certain date, their electricity would be cut off.  But -- as the Court of Appeals held -- this skeletal notice did not advise them of a procedure for challenging the disputed bills.  Such notice may well have been adequate under different circumstances.  Here, however, the notice is given to thousands of customers of various levels of education, experience, and resources.  Lay consumers of electric service, the uninterrupted continuity of which is essential to health and safety, should be informed clearly of the availability of an opportunity to present their complaint.  In essence, recipients of a cutoff notice should be told where, during which hours of the day, and before whom disputed bills appropriately may be considered.  The dissent\'s restrictive view of the process due in the context of this case would erect an artificial barrier between the notice and hearing components of the constitutional guarantee of due process</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners have moved to clarify and regularize their notice procedure, and it is possible that the revised notice presently afforded may be entirely adequate.

Nor are they placed in question by the fact that an employee of uncertain authority told Mrs. Craft, apparently without explanation or attempt at investigation, "[w]ell, you have to pay on the other" bill.

Chicago &amp; N.W. R. Co.,</em> 35 Wis. 425, 530-531.</p>\n<p>MR JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In my judgment, the Court\'s holding confuses and trivializes the principle that the State may not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.  I have no quarrel with the Court\'s conclusion that, as a matter of Tennessee law, a customer has a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued utility services as long as the undisputed portions of his utility bills are paid.  For that reason, a municipality may not terminate utility service without giving the customer a fair opportunity to avoid termination either by paying the bill or questioning its accuracy.  I do not agree, however, that this record discloses any constitutional defect in the termination procedures employed by the Light, Gas and Water Division of the City of Memphis (Division).</p>\n<p>The Court focuses on two aspects of the Division\'s collection procedures.  First, according to the Court, the Division\'s standard form of termination notice did not adequately inform the customer of the availability of a procedure for protesting a proposed termination of service as unjustified.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#15">436 U. S. 15</a></span>.  Second, the Division did not afford its customers an adequate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="23">Page 436 U. S. 23</a></p><p> opportunity to meet with an employee who had the authority to settle billing disputes.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#18">436 U. S. 18</a></span>.  Whether we consider the evidence describing the unusual dispute between the Crafts and the Division, or the evidence concerning the general operation of the Division\'s collection procedures, I find no basis for concluding that either of the Court\'s criticisms is justified; its conclusion that a constitutional violation has been proved is truly extraordinary.</p>\n<p>Although the details of the dispute between the Crafts and the Division are obscure, the record describes the Division\'s customary practices in some detail.  Each month, the Division terminates the service of about 2,000 customers. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Terminations are preceded by a written notice advising the customer of the date by which payment must be made to avoid a cutoff and requesting the customer to contact the credit and collections department if he is having difficulty paying the bill. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The notices contain a prominent legend: [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>PHONE 523-0711\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3>NFORMATION CENTER<p></p>\n<p>Calls to the listed phone number are answered by 30 or 40 Division employees, all of whom are empowered to delay cutoffs for three days based on representations made by customers over the phone.  These employees also direct callers to credit counselors, who are authorized to resolve disputes on a more permanent basis and who can set up extended payment plans for customers in financial difficulty. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="24">Page 436 U. S. 24</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court did not find that the Division\'s notice was defective in any respect, or that its regular practices were not adequate to handle the Crafts\' unusual problems.  The Crafts\' dispute with the Division stemmed from the use of two sets of meters to measure utility consumption in different parts of the Crafts\' home.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#4">436 U. S. 4</a></span>.  The Crafts, believing they were being billed twice for the same utilities, did not pay on the second account.  In fact, the two accounts were independent; because the Crafts refused to pay the balance on the second account, the Division terminated their service on several occasions. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  The District Court expressly found that the Division sent a final notice before each termination.</p>\n<p>The District Court did not find that Mrs. Craft was unable to meet with credit department personnel possessing adequate authority to make an adjustment in her bill. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  She was successful in working out a deferred payment arrangement, but apparently was unable to have the amount of the bills reduced.  The record therefore indicates that Mrs. Craft did meet with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="25">Page 436 U. S. 25</a></p><p> Division employees having adequate authority, but simply failed to persuade any of them that there was any error in her bills. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s constitutional objection to the Division\'s notice rests entirely on the classic statement from <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html">339 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#314">339 U. S. 314</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections."</p>\n<p>That statement identifies the two essential characteristics of adequate notice:  it must inform the recipient of the impending loss and it must be given in time to afford the recipient an opportunity to defend.  These essentials must, of course, be expressed in terms which the layman can understand.  The Division\'s notice unquestionably satisfied these two basic requirements. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>No doubt there may be situations in which these two essentials </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 436 U. S. 26</a></p><p> would not be sufficient to constitute fair notice.  For example, if the notice describes a threatened loss which can only follow a prescheduled hearing, it must also inform the recipient of the time and place of the hearing.  But I do not understand the Court to require municipal utilities to schedule a hearing before each termination notice is mailed.  The Court seems to assume, as I do, that no hearing of any kind is necessary unless the customer has reason to believe he has been overcharged.  Such a customer may protest his bill in either of two ways:  he may communicate directly with the utility or he may seek relief in court.  In this case, the Court finds the Division\'s notice constitutionally defective because it does not describe the former alternative.</p>\n<p>The Division must "advise the customer of the availability of a procedure for protesting a proposed termination of utility service as unjustified."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#15">436 U. S. 15</a></span>.  That advice is much less valuable to the customer than an explanation of the legal remedies that are available if a wrongful termination should occur.  Yet the Court wisely avoids holding that the customer must be given that sort of legal advice.  The advice the Court does require is wholly unnecessary in all but the most unusual situations.  For a homeowner surely need not be told how to complain about an error in a utility bill; it is, of course, helpful to include the telephone number and office address in the termination notice, but our democratic government would cease to function if, as the Court seems to assume, our citizenry were unable to find such information on their own initiative.  The Court\'s holding that the Division\'s notice was constitutionally defective rests on a paternalistic predicate that I cannot accept.</p>\n<p>Even accepting the Court\'s predicate, a notice which advises customers to call the "information center" should be adequate; if not, it seems clear that advising customers to call, during normal business hours, a "dispute resolution center" manned by the same personnel would cure the constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 436 U. S. 27</a></p><p> objection.  Distinctions of this small magnitude are the appropriate concern of administrative rulemaking; they are too trivial to identify constitutional error.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s pronouncement "that due process requires the provision of an opportunity for the presentation to a designated employee of a customer\'s complaint that he is being overcharged or charged for services not rendered," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#16">436 U. S. 16</a></span>, is equally divorced from the facts of this case.  The Division processes more than 30,000 complaints of excess charges each year, and it has designated scores of employees to hear and investigate those complaints.  Except for the Crafts\' troubles, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Division\'s customers are denied access to these employees, or that the employees lack the power to deal appropriately with meritorious complaints.  Indeed, as already noted, there is no finding by either of the courts below that the Crafts themselves did not meet with responsible officials empowered to resolve their dispute. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Court\'s pronouncement in this case is therefore gratuitous, it cannot be dismissed as harmless.  For it warns municipal utilities that, unless they provide "some kind of hearing," <em>ibid.,</em> they may be acting unconstitutionally.  Just what, or why, additional procedural safeguards are constitutionally required is most difficult to discern. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 436 U. S. 28</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In deciding that more process is due, the Court relies on two quite different hypothetical considerations.  First, the Court stresses the fact that disconnection of water or heating "may threaten health and safety."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#18">436 U. S. 18</a></span>.  Second, the Court discounts the value of the protection afforded by the available judicial remedies because the "factual disputes typically [involve] sums of money too small to justify engaging counsel or bringing a lawsuit."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#21">436 U. S. 21</a></span>.  Neither of these examples is disclosed by this record.  The Crafts\' dispute involved only a relatively small amount, but they did obtain counsel, and thereafter they encountered no billing problems.</p>\n<p>Although the Division\'s terminations number about 2,000 each month, the record does not reveal any actual case of harm to health or safety.  The District Court found that the Division does not discontinue service when there is illness in a home.  Since a customer can always avoid termination by the simple expedient of paying the disputed bill and claiming a refund, [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] it is not surprising that the real emergency case is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 436 U. S. 29</a></p><p> rare, if indeed it exists at all. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  When a true emergency does present a serious threat to health or safety, the customer will have ample motivation to take the important step of consulting counsel or filing suit even if the amount of his disputed bill is small.  A potential loss of utility service sufficiently grievous to qualify as a constitutional deprivation can hardly be too petty to justify invoking the aid of counsel or the judiciary.  Conversely, routine billing disputes too petty for the bench or the bar can hardly merit extraordinary constitutional protection.</p>\n<p>Even if the customer does not consult counsel in a specific case, the potential damages remedy nevertheless provides far more significant protection against an unjustified termination than does the vague requirement of "some kind of hearing."  Without the threat of damages liability for mistakes, the informal procedures required today would neither qualify the utility\'s ultimate power to enforce collection by terminating service nor deter the exercise of that power.  On the other hand, even without specific informal procedures, the danger of substantial liability will, by itself, ensure careful attention to genuine customer disputes.  The utility\'s potential liability therefore provides customers with real pre-termination protection even though damages may not be recovered until later.</p>\n<p>The need for a procedural innovation is not demonstrated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 436 U. S. 30</a></p><p> by the record in this judicial proceeding, but rather is justified on the basis of hypothetical examples, information gleaned from cases not before us, and legislative reports.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#18">436 U. S. 18</a></span> nn. 20 and 21.  These justifications suggest that the Court\'s new rule is the product of a policy determination, rather than a traditional construction of the Constitution.  As judges, we have experience in appraising the fairness of legal remedies and judicial proceedings, but we have no similar ability to balance the cost of scheduling thousands of billing conferences against the benefit of providing additional protection to the occasional customer who may be unable to forestall an unjustified termination.</p>\n<p>It is an unfortunate fact that, when the State assesses taxes or operates a utility, it occasionally overcharges the citizen.  It is also unfortunate that effective collection procedures sometimes require the citizen to pay an unjust charge in order to forestall a serious deprivation of property.  But if the State has given the citizen fair notice and afforded him procedural redress which is entirely adequate when invoked by his lawyer, the demands of the Due Process Clause are satisfied.  I do not believe the Constitution requires the State to employ procedures that are so simple that every lay person can always act effectively without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>During the six months from September, 1973, through February, 1974, there were 11,216 so-called delinquent cutoffs.

Information center employees may also refer customers who complain about a high bill to a special unit that sends investigators to check for possible leaks or defects in the meter.  <em>Id.</em> at 178.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The trial judge evidently accepted the Division\'s claim that it was engaged in "split billing," rather than "double billing."  The judge did express the "hope," as a matter of "simple equity," that the Division would issue a credit of $35 to cover duplicate and unnecessary charges and expenses incurred with respect to termination, but the amounts challenged by the Crafts as the result of "double billing" were considerably larger than $35.  The reference to duplicate charges apparently concerns the $2.50 per month city service fee which was charged on each set of meters in the duplex until after they were consolidated.  The unnecessary expense reference apparently covers both the time lost from work while Mrs. Craft was trying to straighten out their billing and the cost attributable to the termination.  The District Court appears to have been persuaded that those costs could have been avoided if the Crafts had been given more help in the early stages of their dispute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court stated that the "procedure for an opportunity to talk with the management was not adequately explained to Mrs. Craft."  The District Court was evaluating the Division\'s explanation of its procedures; the court\'s statement does not mean that Mrs. Craft never met with a responsible official able to resolve her dispute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that the Crafts\' double-billing problem was eventually solved, and that the solution could only have been effected by a Division employee empowered to do so.  Moreover, Mrs. Craft testified on direct examination that, after being cut off, she went to the Division\'s office with the record of her payments on one account.  She was told that she had to pay on the other account as well.  <em>Id.</em> at 91.  In other words, an official of the Division did resolve the Crafts\' dispute, correctly as it turned out.  <em>See</em> <l=|436 1fn2="" 5|="" u.s.="">n. 5, <em>supra.</em>  The Division\'s procedures would not be unconstitutional even if we assumed that Division employees, like federal judges, are occasionally discourteous and occasionally make mistakes.

The Court of Appeals thought that this case was controlled by its earlier decision in <em>Palmer v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc.,</em> 479 F.2d 153 (1973).  <em>Palmer</em> ordered that cutoff notices be delivered personally by utility servicemen or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.  <em>Id.</em> at 159 and 166-167.  The notice had to tell customers about available credit programs, as well as possible dispute-resolving procedures.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The <em>Palmer</em> court also specified that the utility\'s hearing officer had to send -- by certified mail -- a written, individual response to every complaining customer before authorizing a cutoff.  <em>Id.</em> at 159-160, n. 9, and 167-169.  Although the Division\'s failure to observe these procedures was the foundation of the Court of Appeals\' ruling below, the Court quite clearly does not approve the lower court\'s view that these procedures are constitutionally mandated.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>If there is no constitutional objection to requiring a tenant to pay a disputed charge in order to retain possession of his home, I do not understand why there should be a more serious objection to requiring payment of a lesser charge in order to retain utility service.  In <em>Lindsey v. Normet,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/56/case.html">405 U. S. 56</a></span>, a tenant sought to defend a possessory action brought by his landlord for nonpayment of rent on the ground that the premises were uninhabitable, and therefore there was no obligation to pay the rent.  State law did not permit such a defense in a possessory action.  In order to litigate that particular dispute, the tenant had to bring his own action against the landlord.  If the tenant had not in fact paid the disputed rent, the landlord would prevail in the possessory action.  Thus, in order to retain possession while litigating the dispute, the tenant not only had to pay the accruing rent (a requirement upheld in <em>Lindsey, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/56/case.html#65">405 U. S. 65</a></span>), but also had to pay the back rent, an obligation which he disputed.  If he did not pay the back rent, he would lose in the possessory action, and therefore would lose possession while he was prosecuting his own suit against the landlord.  Thus, the Court sustained a procedure which required the payment of  disputed charge in order to maintain the <em>status quo</em> while litigating the dispute.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/12" name="F2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>Even the customer who is unable to pay his bill in full may forestall termination by a partial payment.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/1/case.html#5">436 U. S. 5</a></span>-6, n. 4.  Perhaps this Court fashions its rule for the benefit of those customers who are unable to make even a partial payment.  But if such persons cannot pay current, undisputed bills, their service may be terminated despite a bona fide dispute over a past bill; for no one has a constitutional right to free utility service.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
