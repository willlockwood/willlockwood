The defendant in error is alleged in the proceedings to be a citizen of the United States, naturalized in Louisiana and residing there.  This is equivalent to an averment that he is a citizen of that state.  A citizen of the United States residing in any state of the union is a citizen of that state.</p>\n<p>The authorities on this question have gone far enough, and this Court is not disposed to narrow any more the limitations which have been imposed by the decided cases.  They have gone as far as it would be reasonable and proper to go.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the District Court of Louisiana is affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
