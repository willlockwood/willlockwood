"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 43 U. S. 261</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DANIEL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The principles ruled in the case of <em>Thompson v. Griffin and Ervin</em> as those which define the duties and should govern the conduct of the marshal in levying executions committed to his hands have been here again considered and approved.  They would be decisive also of the case now under consideration but for two points of difference between this and the case of <em>Thompson v. Griffin.</em>  These two points arise 1st upon the time intervening between the return of the marshal and the plaintiff\'s motion, as tending to show an acquiescence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 43 U. S. 262</a></p><p> by the plaintiff, and secondly upon the additional evidence in this case amounting to proof of approbation or sanction by the plaintiff, express or implied, of the conduct of the marshal.  In <em>Thompson v. Griffin,</em> application was made to the court at the earliest practicable period to set aside the marshal\'s return, and there was throughout no fact or circumstance tending to show a recognition by the party or a moment\'s acquiescence by him in the irregularity complained of.  In the present case, the return of the marshal showing the receipt by him of the depreciated banknotes bears date 17 February, 1840; the motion to quash was made in May, 1842.  Thus an interval of more than two years was permitted to elapse between the return and the motion -- a period during which the party must be presumed to have been cognizant of the return, a public and official proceeding to be found amongst the files and records of the court to which access might at all times have been had.  If this fact stood alone, unassociated with and unexplained by any other, it would of itself imply at least, on the part of the plaintiff, laches and negligence in the prosecution of his interests, if not an assent by him to the acts of the officer.  This fact of time, however, is by no means solitary or isolated in the evidence in this cause.  The language of the return certainly imports no objection by the plaintiff or by any other to the receipt of the $1,300 or to the medium in which they were collected.  So far from this, then taken altogether, that language strongly implies, if it does not directly declare, that the plaintiff, or whosoever he was that took control of the matter, approved of the proceeding so far as it had gone, and objected only to a collection of the residue of the execution at that time.  It should not be lost sight of either, in construing this language, that no exception to any one kind of medium or preference for any other is indicated in the inhibition as stated; it is a simple direction to proceed no farther.  It cannot be objected to the return in question that it is the act or declaration of the officer whose conduct in making it is impeached.  Although the act of that officer, it is a sworn return, and must stand until falsified.  It is introduced by the plaintiff himself in support of his motion; is indeed the only evidence he has adduced to sustain it.  He relies on this return, and in so doing must take it entire; he cannot be permitted to garble it.  The return must be received as stating the truth.  It must be received in all its parts, and if so, it comes (especially when viewed in connection with the interval between the dates of that return and of the motion in this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="263">Page 43 U. S. 263</a></p><p> case), on the part of the plaintiff, an acquiescence if not a direct sanction which, at this day, this Court is unwilling to disturb.  Great wrong might, by so late an interference, be visited upon the officer, who may have been reposing upon the conduct of this plaintiff, and the danger of a result like this is enhanced by the total absence of anything like proof to show that the plaintiff ever refused to receive the amount collected by the marshal, and may not have actually received and applied it to his own use, or at what rate of value if so received.</p>\n<p><em>This Court is of the opinion upon the case certified to them that the return of the marshal of 17 February, 1840, should not, under the facts disclosed in this case, be quashed.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi, and on the point and question on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion and which was certified to this Court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that the return of the marshal of 17 February, 1840, should not, under the facts disclosed in this case, be quashed.  Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that it be so certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
