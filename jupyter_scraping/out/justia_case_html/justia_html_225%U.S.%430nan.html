JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a bill to prevent the enforcement of an ordinance of the City of Louisville fixing telephone rates, passed in 1909, after the attempt of the city to deprive the appellee of its franchise, when that seemed likely to fail.  <em>See Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/224/649/case.html">224 U. S. 649</a></span>.  The question raised is the usual one of confiscation.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 225 U. S. 433</a></p><p> In consequence of the conclusion to which we have come, we shall make a much more summary statement of the facts than in other circumstances might be necessary.  The case was referred to a master, and he reported in favor of the city.  He was of opinion that, in the first year after the ordinance should go into effect, there would be a less of $30,000, but that in another year or so, in view of the probable increase of subscribers, the company would get back to its former net revenue with a probable continuous increase thereafter, and would earn a sufficient return.  The judge was of a different opinion, and, for the purposes of the present decision only, we shall adopt his figures, subject to the changes that we shall state, which leave us unprepared to sustain the decree without giving the ordinance a trial to show its actual effect.</p>\n<p>The judge\'s values were:</p>\n<p>Plant, including toll lines . . . . . . . . .   $1,575,000.00</p>\n<p>Real estate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      162,000.00</p>\n<p>Supplies on hand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       18,000.00</p>\n<p>Working capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       33,000.00</p>\n<p>-------------</p>\n<p>$1,788,000.00</p>\n<p>Gross earnings for 1908, including 15%</p>\n<p>of receipts from toll lines.  This was</p>\n<p>undisputed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     $325,838.30</p>\n<p>The court added 10% more of the toll</p>\n<p>line receipts, making. . . . . . . . . . .      330,926.38</p>\n<p>The master was of opinion that the re-</p>\n<p>maining 85 percent should be added, mak-</p>\n<p>ing the total gross earnings . . . . . . .     $369,087.00</p>\n<p>For the purpose of such an estimate as</p>\n<p>this, we think that the toll lines should</p>\n<p>be either in or out, and if they are to</p>\n<p>be counted in the property upon which</p>\n<p>the appellee is not to be prevented by</p>\n<p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 225 U. S. 434</a></p><p></p>\n<p>law from earning a fair return, as they</p>\n<p>are above, and the expenses charged to</p>\n<p>the appellee, the whole return from</p>\n<p>them should be added to the gross</p>\n<p>earnings of the appellee.  So we take</p>\n<p>the total gross earnings as. . . . . . . .     $369,087.00</p>\n<p>Expenses as found by the</p>\n<p>master and accepted accepted</p>\n<p>by the judge . . . . . . . .   $216,363.07</p>\n<p>But this includes amount</p>\n<p>charged to the Exchange</p>\n<p>for the use of real estate</p>\n<p>(less expenses for repairs),</p>\n<p>which, in view of the in-</p>\n<p>clusion of real estate above,</p>\n<p>it should not. . . . . . . .     11,707.52</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>$204,655.55</p>\n<p>Deduct corrected expenses from gross earnings      204,655.55</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>Net earnings . . . . . . . . . . . . .     $164,431.45</p>\n<p>Even if we deduct from the net earnings</p>\n<p>a sum estimated by the judge as neces-</p>\n<p>sary above actual expenditures of 1908</p>\n<p>to make good average depreciation                24,095.02</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>we have. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     $140,336,43</p>\n<p>which is nearly eight percent on the</p>\n<p>estimated value.

S. 436</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We express no opinion whether to cut this telephone company down to six percent by legislation would or would not be confiscatory.  But when it is remembered what clear evidence the court requires before it declares legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when it is considered how speculative every figure is that we have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion that the result is too near the dividing line not to make actual experiment necessary.  The master thought that the probable net income for the year that would suffer the greatest decrease would be 8.60 percent on the values estimated by him.  The judge, on assumptions to which we have stated our disagreement, makes the present earnings 5 10/17 percent, with a reduction by the ordinance to 36/17 percent.  The whole question is too much in the air for us to feel authorized to let the injunction stand.</p>\n<p><em>Decree reversed without prejudice.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
