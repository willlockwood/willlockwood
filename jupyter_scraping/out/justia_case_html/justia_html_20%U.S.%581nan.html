At a court of Vice admiralty held the twenty-sixth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen, before me, the Worshipful Theodore George Alexander, Esquire, judge and Commissary of the said court, John S. Thompson, the master of the American ship <em>Holofern,</em> by William Kerr and Henry M. Williams, his proctor in that behalf duly appointed, came into court and alleged that on the twentieth day of this instant month of October, he did exhibit a libel or information against the said ship, when he gave the court to understand and be informed that on the eighth day of October instant, the said John S. Thompson, by his proctor aforesaid, did make humble petition to the court stating that on the ninth day of September last past, he sailed in and with the said ship from Wiscasset, in the State of Massachusetts, bound on a voyage to Havana, in the Island of Cuba, with a cargo of lumber, spars, oars, anchors, and coals, and on the eighteenth day of the same month, in latitude 28\xef\xbf\xbd39\', by observation, he experienced a very violent gale of wind, during which the said ship sprung a leak; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="584">Page 20 U. S. 584</a></p><p> that all hands were in consequence thereof employed at the pumps until the twenty-fourth of the same month, when he had proceeded on his voyage as far as the Bahama Bank; that at"</p>\n<p>brk:</p>\n<p>"that time, the people being nearly exhausted by incessant labor at the pumps, they insisted on bearing up for New Providence, which he thought it prudent to do as the wind was then westerly, and ahead for the Havana; that he accordingly proceeded for New Providence with the said ship, and arrived in the harbor of Nassau on the twenty-sixth day of the said month of September; that since the arrival of the said ship in the said port, a part of her cargo had been landed, and, upon his inspecting and examining into her condition, he conceived her not only unfit to proceed to sea again in her present state, but altogether unworthy of being repaired.  And he therefore prayed that a warrant might forthwith issue out of this honorable court, according to law and the usage and practice of the said court in such cases, to cause the said ship to be surveyed and examined by persons duly competent in that behalf, who might report as to the true state and condition of the said ship.  And thereupon a warrant did issue accordingly, directed to William Gibson and John Russell of the island of New Providence, shipwrights, and Samuel Clutsam, of the same place, late a master mariner, who did certify, on the nineteenth day of October instant, on oath, that on the eighth day of October instant they repaired on board the said American ship <em>Holofern,</em> John S.

And they did further certify, that on the sixteenth day of October instant, the said ship being then nearly discharged, they were enabled to inspect and examine into her state and condition, and having done so minutely and diligently, they found her to be in a very leaky state, and having at the same time caused a part of her inside ceiling to be stripped off, they discovered the said ship to be in a very decayed condition.

This question was overruled by the judge.</p>\n<p>The same witness was then asked, by the plaintiff\'s counsel, whether the inside ceiling of the said ship was ever stripped off, as stated in the said sentence of condemnation, and whether she was not in such a situation, by reason of the position of such parts of her cargo and ballast as remained on board, and of the water in the hold, that it could not have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="589">Page 20 U. S. 589</a></p><p> been stripped off as there stated?  This question was in like manner overruled.</p>\n<p>The witness was then asked whether he had not been informed by Gibson, one of the surveyors, that the <em>Holofern</em> was not condemned on account of her being rotten, but because she could not be hove down to be repaired for want of conveniences for that purpose at New Providence?  This question was also overruled.</p>\n<p>The same witness was then asked whether he did not, by directions from the Messrs. Storrs, after the sale of the ship and cargo (at which sale the witness was not present), call upon the said Gibson, as having purchased part of the said cargo at auction, for the price thereof, and receive the same?  The judge having ascertained, by inquiry of the plaintiff\'s counsel, that they had been in possession of the account sales of the said cargo, signed by the Messrs. Storrs, but that the same had been sent to Maine to recover a loss upon a policy on the cargo subscribed there, overruled the said question.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff\'s counsel excepted to the several decisions overruling the said questions. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 20 U.

S. 610</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE JOHNSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The material question in this cause arises on the construction of a clause in the policy, expressed in these words,</p>\n<p>"and lastly, it is agreed that if the above vessel, upon a regular survey, should be thereby declared unseaworthy, by reason of her being unsound or rotten, or incapable of prosecuting her voyage on account of her being unsound or rotten,"</p>\n<p>then the assurers shall not be bound to pay their subscription on this policy.  The special verdict negatives the proposition of the vessel\'s being unsound at the time of her sailing, and it is contended for the plaintiff, that this neutralizes the condemnation and survey given in evidence; that contracts of insurance in their nature have reference to the commencement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 20 U. S. 611</a></p><p> of the risk, as least with relation to questions of seaworthiness, and as it is impossible for a sound vessel to become rotten in a month, it is argued that the verdict of the jury ought to prevail against the evidence, or influence of the condemnation.</p>\n<p>But we think otherwise.  The words of the contract expressly look forward to a future event, "if the said vessel, upon a regular survey, should be thereby declared unseaworthy," obviously contemplating two objects -- first, that a State of rottenness ascertained at any period of the voyage insured shall be conclusive evidence of original unsoundness; secondly, that the determination of that fact by means of a regular survey should be received as conclusive evidence between the parties.  It is unquestionably true in the abstract that a certificate of survey is not legal evidence, because the examination of the surveyors themselves would be better.  But parties may by compact adopt that or any other, as the criterion for deciding on their relative rights, and in the case before us, the rights of the parties are made to depend on the fact of the survey rather than on the truth of it.  They have chosen a rule of decision for themselves, and we are not to inquire into their motives or prudence in doing so.  Whether the survey in this instance was duly substantiated is the next question which the case presents.  And here it becomes altogether unnecessary to decide whether a condemnation, in ordinary cases, carries with it the evidence of the fact or of the fairness of the survey.  For it must be observed that the exemplification of the proceedings in the Court of Vice-Admiralty in New Providence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 20 U. S. 612</a></p><p> was produced in evidence by the plaintiff himself.  He claimed for a total loss, and to support this claim it became necessary to show that the vessel was condemned and sold, and the voyage broken up in New Providence.  But if this exemplification should be admitted to prove those facts alone, without exposing the causes which led to them; if the eyes of the jury were to be shut against everything but the outside of the record, <em>non constat,</em> but the vessel may have been condemned for some cause for which the underwriters were not liable, and his case would not have been made out.  Such subtleties cannot be countenanced; the survey was a part of the <em>res gesta,</em> and the plaintiff could not possibly have made out the loss without introducing the survey which led to it.</p>\n<p>The survey was therefore properly in evidence, and that it was "a regular survey," in the language of the covenant, is to be deduced from two considerations.  First, if there was any irregularity in the survey, it is attributable to the plaintiff\'s own agents; for even the Storrs, in this case, although the general agents of the company, were voluntarily selected by the captain.  But secondly, the survey bears every evidence of regularity or authenticity that can reasonably be required.  On this subject, the nature of the contract of insurance casts the parties on the municipal regulations of all the world.  Every commercial country has its own regulations on the subject of surveys.  It is properly a subject of admiralty jurisdiction, since mariners and freighters have to claim the aid of the admiralty to release them from their contract in cases of a defect of seaworthiness.  A </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 20 U.

In this instance, both from the jurisdiction assumed by the court and the known habits of British jurisprudence, the mode of passing a survey through a court to give it authenticity, may well be adjudged a regular survey according to the laws of the port into which this vessel was forced.  If this be the case, it follows that the exemplification of the proceedings of that court is not only admissible evidence, but perhaps the only evidence that could be received of the survey.  And as to the idea of extracting the original return from the files of that court, to produce it here, it will not bear reflection.  The same considerations fully justify the court below in rejecting the evidence of the captain, offered to rebut the decision of a court, and that decision, both procured by the plaintiff\'s own agent, and produced by himself in evidence.</p>\n<p>But it is contended that though the construction of the covenant be with the defendants, and the survey be held to be legally before the jury, and "a regular survey" within the meaning of the policy, still it is not conclusive against the plaintiff, inasmuch as it certifies the existence of other causes of loss, besides the decayed state of the vessel.</p>\n<p>It is unquestionably true that the survey must respond to the covenant, and if the vessel be declared unseaworthy, for any additional cause, besides her being, in the language of the policy, "unsound or rotten," the defeasance, if it may be so called, will not avail the defendant.  But what is the case here?  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 20 U. S. 614</a></p><p> All the facts to be gathered from the exemplification of the condemnation, taking it from the commencement to the close, are that the vessel encountered tempestuous weather, that she was forced to put into New Providence in consequence of springing a leak, that the Captain "conceiving her not only unfit to proceed to sea again in her present state, but altogether unworthy of being repaired," libeled her in the admiralty and prayed a warrant of survey upon her; upon issuing the warrant, the surveyors proceeded to an examination, and finding the vessel very leaky, stripped off part of her ceiling, and found her, as they report, "in a very decayed condition."  They thereupon certified her to be "altogether unworthy of being repaired, and that she ought to be condemned as being unsafe and unfit ever to go to sea again."  Here decay is exhibited exclusively as the mortal disease, and everything else is either inducement or consequence.  A bad vessel might have made a safe voyage, had she experienced no trying weather, and a good vessel would have encountered gales without injury.  Springing a leak was the consequence of that state of decay which weakened the whole fabric, and her being unworthy of repair or unfit to go to sea, was no additional cause of condemnation, but the mode in which her disease produced her destruction.  Causes upon similar policies, and under similar circumstances, have in several instances passed in review before the tribunals of this country, and received decisions consonant to this.  The case between <em>Marine Insurance Company of Alexandria v, Wilson,</em> decided in this Court, did </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 20 U. S. 615</a></p><p> not resemble this in any prominent feature, except that the policy contained the same clause, and the defense was attempted under the protection of it.  But neither in the evidence nor in the pleadings, did the defendants bring themselves within the provisions of the clause.</p>\n<p>This Court is therefore of opinion that there was no error in the decision of the court below.  But an inconsiderable omission (made palpable by the briefs furnished by both parties) having been committed in copying the record, and which leaves it doubtful in what form this decision is to be certified to the court below, this Court will, for the present, order a certiorari to issue, that the correction may be duly made.</p>\n<p><em>Certiorari awarded.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
