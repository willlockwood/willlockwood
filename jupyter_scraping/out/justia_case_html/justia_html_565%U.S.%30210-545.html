Berne\xe2\x80\x99s 164 member states agree to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.  Of central importance in this case, Article 18 of Berne requires countries to protect the works of other member states unless the works\xe2\x80\x99 copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is claimed or the country of origin.  A different system of transnational copyright protection long prevailed in this country.  Throughout most of the 20th century, the only foreign authors eligible for Copyright Act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to American authors and whose works were printed in the United States.  Despite Article 18, when the United States joined Berne in 1989, it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the U.\xc2\xa0S. public domain, many of them works never protected here.  In 1994, however, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights mandated implementation of Berne\xe2\x80\x99s first 21 articles, on pain of enforcement by the World Trade Organization.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn response, Congress applied the term of protection available to U.\xc2\xa0S. works to preexisting works from Berne member countries.  Section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) grants copyright protection to works protected in their country of origin, but lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had not complied with certain U.\xc2\xa0S. statutory formalities.  Works encompassed by \xc2\xa7514 are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States maintained copyright relations with the author\xe2\x80\x99s country or removed formalities incompatible with Berne.  As a consequence of the barriers to U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright protection prior to \xc2\xa7514\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, foreign works \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country.  To cushion the impact of their placement in protected status, \xc2\xa7514 provides ameliorating accommodations for parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was enacted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to works \xc2\xa7514 removed from the public domain.  They maintain that Congress, in passing \xc2\xa7514, exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed \n \nFirst Amendment limitations.  The District Court granted the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  Affirming in part, the Tenth Circuit agreed that Congress had not offended the Copyright Clause, but concluded that \xc2\xa7514 required further \n \nFirst Amendment inspection in light of Eldred v. Ashcroft, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186\n.  On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the \n \nFirst Amendment claim, holding that \xc2\xa7514\xe2\x80\x99s constriction of the public domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, ruling that \xc2\xa7514 was narrowly tailored to fit the important government aim of protecting U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright holders\xe2\x80\x99 interests abroad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Section 514 does not exceed Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under the Copyright Clause.

Eldred is largely dispositive of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s confinement of a copyright\xe2\x80\x99s lifespan to a \xe2\x80\x9climited Tim[e]\xe2\x80\x9d prevents the removal of works from the public domain.  In Eldred, the Court upheld the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copyrights.  The text of the Copyright Clause, the Court observed, contains no \xe2\x80\x9ccommand that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever \xe2\x80\x98fixed\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98inalterable,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and the Court declined to infer any such command.  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 199.  The construction petitioners tender here is similarly infirm.  The terms afforded works restored by \xc2\xa7514 are no less \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d than those the CTEA lengthened.  Nor had the \xe2\x80\x9climited Tim[e]\xe2\x80\x9d already passed for the works at issue here\xe2\x80\x94many of them works formerly denied any U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright protection\xe2\x80\x94for a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end.  Petitioners also urge that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position would allow Congress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive \xe2\x80\x9climited\xe2\x80\x9d terms as prior terms expire.  But as in Eldred, such hypothetical misbehavior is far afield from this case.  In aligning the United States with other nations bound by Berne, Congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual copyright regime.

In the Copyright Act of 1790, the First Congress protected works that had been freely reproducible under State copyright laws.  Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works.  Several private bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inventions previously in the public domain.  Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works and inventions that had lost protection.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9319.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Petitioners also argue that \xc2\xa7514 fails to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote the Progress of Science\xe2\x80\x9d as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright Clause.  Specifically, they claim that because \xc2\xa7514 affects only works already created, it cannot meet the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s objective.  The creation of new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote \xe2\x80\x9cScience,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., knowledge and learning.  In Eldred, this Court rejected a nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to induce new works.  Rather the Clause \xe2\x80\x9cempowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 222.  Nothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, confines the \xe2\x80\x9cProgress of Science\xe2\x80\x9d exclusively to \xe2\x80\x9cincentives for creation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Historical evidence, congressional practice, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing works is an appropriate means to promote science.

Congress had reason to believe that a well-functioning international copyright system would encourage the dissemination of existing and future works.  And testimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would expand the foreign markets available to U.\xc2\xa0S. authors and invigorate protection against piracy of U.\xc2\xa0S. works abroad, thus benefitting copyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.  This Court has no warrant to reject Congress\xe2\x80\x99 rational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve the objectives of the Copyright Clause.

There, the Court held that the CTEA\xe2\x80\x99s enlargement of a copyright\xe2\x80\x99s duration did not offend the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of expression guarantee.  Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an \xe2\x80\x9cengine of free expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 219.  The \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional contours\xe2\x80\x9d of copyright protection, i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9cidea/expression dichotomy\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cfair use\xe2\x80\x9d defense, moreover, serve as \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt-in \n \nFirst Amendment accommodations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Given the speech-protective purposes and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the heightened review sought in Eldred.  The Court reaches the same conclusion here.  Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression distinction and the fair use defense.  Moreover, Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime.

Their contentions depend on an argument already considered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by Congress.  Nothing in the historical record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence warrants exceptional \n \nFirst Amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.  Congress has several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of works as well as works previously in the public domain.  Section 514, moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.  The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must pay for their desired use of the author\xe2\x80\x99s expression, or else limit their exploitation to \xe2\x80\x9cfair use\xe2\x80\x9d of those works.  By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.  Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.

Latecomer to the international copyright regime launched by Berne, the United States joined the Convention in 1989.  To perfect U.\xc2\xa0S. implementation of Berne, and as part of our response to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, Congress, in 1994, gave works enjoying copyright protection abroad the same full term of protection available to U.\xc2\xa0S. works.  Congress did so in \xc2\xa7514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which grants copyright protection to preexisting works of Berne member countries, protected in their country of origin, but lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The United States did  not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication; the United States did not protect sound recordings fixed before 1972; or the author had failed to comply with U.\xc2\xa0S. statutory formalities (formalities Congress no longer requires as prerequisites to copyright protection).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe URAA accords no protection to a foreign work after its full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into the public domain, whether under the laws of the country of origin or of this country.  Works encompassed by \xc2\xa7514 are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States maintained copyright relations with the author\xe2\x80\x99s country or removed formalities incompatible with Berne.  Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the protection they lacked in years prior to \xc2\xa7514\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  They therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than do their U.\xc2\xa0S. counterparts.  As a consequence of the barriers to U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright protection prior to the enactment of \xc2\xa7514, foreign works \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country.

Thus, as long as Congress legislated in installments, perpetual copyright terms would be achievable.

In aligning the United States with other nations bound by the Berne Convention, and thereby according equitable treatment to once dis-favored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a regime of perpetual copyrights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHistorical practice corroborates our reading of the Copyright Clause to permit full U.\xc2\xa0S. compliance with Berne.

Section 514\xe2\x80\x99s disturbance of that domain, petitioners argue, distin-  guishes their suit from Eldred\xe2\x80\x99s.  In adopting the CTEA, petitioners note, Congress acted in accord with \xe2\x80\x9can unbroken congressional practice\xe2\x80\x9d of granting pre-expiration term extensions, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 200.

Yet the TRIPS accord, leading the United States to comply in full measure with Berne, was also a signal event.  See supra, at 7\xe2\x80\x938; cf.

In Eldred, we rejected an argument nearly identical to the one petitioners rehearse.  The Eldred petitioners urged that the \xe2\x80\x9cCTEA\xe2\x80\x99s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to \xe2\x80\x98promote the Progress of Science,\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because it does not stimulate the creation of new works.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211\xe2\x80\x93212.  In response to this argument, we   held that the Copyright Clause does not demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to induce new works.  Rather, we explained, the Clause \xe2\x80\x9cempowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 222.  And those permissible ends, we held, extended beyond the creation of new works.  See id., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206 (rejecting the notion that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the only way to promote the progress of science [is] to provide incentives  to create new works\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Perlmutter, Participation in the International Copyright System as a Means to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, 36 Loyola (LA) L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 323, 332 (2002))).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F26" name="T26">\n\t\t\t\t\t26\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven were we writing on a clean slate, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument would be unavailing.

Evidence from the founding, moreover, suggests that inducing dissemination\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to creation\xe2\x80\x94was viewed as an appropriate means to promote science.  See Nachbar, Constructing Copyright\xe2\x80\x99s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 44 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe scope of copyright protection existing at the time of the framing,\xe2\x80\x9d trained as it was on \xe2\x80\x9cpublication, not creation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis inconsistent with claims that copyright must promote creative activity in order to be valid.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

The petitioners in Eldred, like those here, argued that Congress had violated not only the \xe2\x80\x9climited Times\xe2\x80\x9d prescription of the Copyright Clause.  In addition, and independently, the Eldred petitioners charged, Congress had offended the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of expression guarantee.  The CTEA\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year enlargement of a copyright\xe2\x80\x99s duration, we held in Eldred, offended neither provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConcerning the \n \nFirst Amendment, we recognized that some restriction on expression is the inherent and in-tended effect of every grant of copyright.

Petitioners here attempt to achieve under the banner of the \n \nFirst Amendment what they could not win under the Copyright Clause: On their view of the Copyright Clause, the public domain is inviolable; as they read the \n \nFirst Amendment, the public domain is policed through heightened judicial scrutiny of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 means and ends.  As we have already shown, see supra, at 13\xe2\x80\x9319, the text of the Copyright Clause and the historical record scarcely establish that \xe2\x80\x9conce a work enters the public domain,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress cannot permit anyone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot even the creator\xe2\x80\x94[to] copyright it,\xe2\x80\x9d 501 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1184.

See, e.g., \n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cCopyright in a work protected .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. vests initially in the author .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Once the term of protection ends, the works do not revest in any rightholder.  Instead, the works simply lapse into the public domain.  See, e.g., Berne, Art. 18(1), 828 U.\xc2\xa0N.\xc2\xa0T.\xc2\xa0S., at 251 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Convention shall apply to all works which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have not yet fallen into the public domain\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).

For example, Congress broke new ground when it extended copyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar. 3, \xc2\xa713, \n\n26Stat.\n1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of Aug. 18, \n\n11Stat.\n138; to photographs and photographic negatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, \xc2\xa71, \n\n13Stat.\n540; to motion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, \n\n37Stat.\n488; to fixed sound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, \n\n85Stat.\n391; and to architectural works in 1990, Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act, \n\n104Stat.\n5133.  And on several occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected works previously in the public domain, hence freely usable by the public.  See supra, at 15\xe2\x80\x9319.  If Congress could grant protection to these works without hazarding heightened \n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech principle disarms it from protecting works prematurely cast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the Berne Convention?\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F33" name="T33">\n\t\t\t\t\t33\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 514, we add, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.

Prokofiev\xe2\x80\x99s Peter and the Wolf could once be performed free of charge; after \xc2\xa7514 the right to perform it must be obtained in the marketplace.  This is the same marketplace, of course, that exists for the music of Prokofiev\xe2\x80\x99s U.\xc2\xa0S. contemporaries: works of Copland and Bernstein, for example, that enjoy copyright protection, but nevertheless appear regularly in the programs of U.\xc2\xa0S. concertgoers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBefore we joined Berne, domestic works and some foreign works were protected under U.\xc2\xa0S. statutes and bilateral international agreements, while other foreign works were available at an artificially low (because royalty-free)   cost.  By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that most works, whether foreign or domestic, would be governed by the same legal regime.  The phenomenon to which Congress responded is not new: Distortions of the same order occurred with greater frequency\xe2\x80\x94and to the detriment of both foreign and domestic authors\xe2\x80\x94when, before 1891, foreign works were excluded entirely from U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright protection.  See Kampelman, The United States and International Copyright, 41 Am. J. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 406, 413 (1947) (\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican readers were less inclined to read the novels of Cooper or Hawthorne for a dollar when they could buy a novel of Scott or Dickens for a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Section 514 continued the trend toward a harmonized copyright regime by placing foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.  Authors once deprived of protection are spared the continuing effects of that initial deprivation; \xc2\xa7514 gives them nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F35" name="T35">\n\t\t\t\t\t35\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnlike petitioners, the dissent makes much of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9corphan works\xe2\x80\x9d problem.  See post, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314, 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  We readily acknowledge the difficulties would-be users of copyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating copyright owners.  See generally U.\xc2\xa0S. Copyright Office, Report on Orphan Works 21\xe2\x80\x9340 (2006).  But as the dissent concedes, see post, at 13, this difficulty is hardly peculiar to works restored under \xc2\xa7514.  It similarly afflicts, for   instance, U.\xc2\xa0S. libraries that attempt to catalogue U.\xc2\xa0S. books.  See post, at 12.  See also Brief for American Library Association et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 22 (Section 514 \xe2\x80\x9cexacerbated,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not create, the problem of orphan works); U.\xc2\xa0S.

Indeed, the host of policy and logistical questions identified by the dissent speak for themselves.  Post, at 12.  Despite \xe2\x80\x9clongstanding efforts,\xe2\x80\x9d see Authors Guild, 770 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 678 (quoting statement of Marybeth Peters), Congress has not yet passed ameliorative orphan-works legislation of the sort enacted by other Berne members, see, e.g., Canada Copyright Act, R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C., 1985, c. C\xe2\x80\x9342, \xc2\xa777 (authorizing Copyright Board to license use of orphan works by persons unable, after making reasonable efforts, to locate the copyright owner).  Heretofore, no one has suggested that the orphan-works issue should be addressed through our implementation of Berne, rather than through overarching legislation of the sort proposed in Congress and cited by the dissent.  See post, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324; U.\xc2\xa0S. Copyright Office, Legal Issues in Mass Digitization 25\xe2\x80\x9329 (2011) (discussing recent legislative efforts).  Our unstinting adherence to Berne may add impetus to calls   for the enactment of such legislation.  But resistance to Berne\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions surely is not a necessary or proper response to the pervasive question, what should Congress do about orphan works.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCongress determined that U.\xc2\xa0S. interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection.

This \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive Right\xe2\x80\x9d allows its holder to charge a fee to those who wish to use a copyrighted work, and the ability to charge that fee encourages the production of new material.  In this sense, a copyright is, in Macaulay\xe2\x80\x99s words, a \xe2\x80\x9ctax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a bounty designed to encourage new production.

By definition, it bestows monetary rewards only on owners of old works\xe2\x80\x94works that have already been created and already are in the American public domain.  At the same time, the statute inhibits the dissemination of those works, foreign works published abroad after 1923, of which there are many millions, including films, works of art, innumerable photographs, and, of course, books\xe2\x80\x94books that (in the absence of the statute) would assume their rightful places in computer-accessible databases, spreading knowledge throughout the world.  See infra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313.  In my view, the Copyright Clause does not authorize Congress to enact this statute.  And I consequently dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe possibility of eliciting new production is, and always has been, an essential precondition for American copyright protection.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive Right,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9climited Times,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cProgress of Science,\xe2\x80\x9d viewed through the lens of history underscore the legal significance of what the Court in Eldred referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic philosophy behind the Copyright Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212, n.\xc2\xa018 (brackets omitted).  That philosophy understands copyright\xe2\x80\x99s grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as private benefits that are conferred for a public reason\xe2\x80\x94to elicit new creation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet, as the Founders recognized, monopoly is a two-edged sword.  On the one hand, it can encourage production of new works.  In the absence of copyright protection, anyone might freely copy the products of an author\xe2\x80\x99s creative labor, appropriating the benefits without incurring the nonrepeatable costs of creation, thereby deterring authors from exerting themselves in the first place.  On the other hand, copyright tends to restrict the dissemination (and use) of works once produced either because the absence of competition translates directly into higher consumer prices or because the need to secure copying permission sometimes imposes administrative costs that make it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work to find its owner and strike a bargain.  See W. Landes &amp; R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 68\xe2\x80\x9370, 213\xe2\x80\x93214 (2003).  Consequently, the original British copyright statute, the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Framers, and our case law all have recognized copyright\xe2\x80\x99s resulting  and necessary call for balance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the time the Framers wrote the Constitution, they were well aware of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s 18th-century copyright statute, the Statute of Anne, 8 Anne, ch. 19 (1710), and they were aware of the legal struggles that produced it.  That statute sought in part to control, and to limit, preexisting monopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result of the Crown\xe2\x80\x99s having previously granted special privileges to royal favorites.  The Crown, for example, had chartered the Stationers\xe2\x80\x99 Company, permitting it to regulate and to censor works on the government\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  The Stationers had thereby acquired control over the disposition of copies of published works, from which emerged  the Stationers\xe2\x80\x99 copyright\xe2\x80\x94a right conferred on company members, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpetuity.

It bore the title: \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it granted authors (not publishers) and their assignees the \xe2\x80\x9csole Right and Liberty of printing\xe2\x80\x9d their works for limited periods of time in order to encourage them \xe2\x80\x9cto compose and write useful Books.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 Anne, ch. 19, \xc2\xa71 (emphasis added).

L.\xc2\xa0J. 106, 108 (2003).  At first, in their attempts to minimize their losses, the booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual common-law copyright in their works deriving from their natural rights as creators.  But the House of Lords ultimately held in Donaldson v. Beckett, 1 Eng. Rep. 837 (1774), that the Statute of Anne had transformed any such perpetual common-law copyright into a copyright of a limited term designed to serve the public interest.

Patterson 93.  Thomas Jefferson, for example, initially expressed great uncertainty as to whether the Constitution should authorize the grant of copyrights and patents at all, writing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful\xe2\x80\x9d to warrant anything other than their \xe2\x80\x9csuppression.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J.

James Madison also thought that \xe2\x80\x9cMonopolies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are justly classed among the greatest nu[i]sances in Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at 16, 21 (J.

Patterson 158\xe2\x80\x93179, 183\xe2\x80\x93192.  Premised on the idea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to the fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legendary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to every cow her calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Birrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copyright in Books 42 (1899).  That view, though perhaps reflected in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, ante, at 30, runs contrary to the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of our own Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Copyright Clause.

In Mazer, for example, the Court refers to copyright as embodying the view that \xe2\x80\x9cencouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\xe2\x80\x9d  347 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 219 (emphasis added).  In Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 151 (1975)\n, the Court says that underlying copyright is the understanding that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]reative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 156 (emphasis added).  And in Sony Corp. of Amer-ica v. Universal City Studios, Inc., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417 (1984)\n, the Court, speaking of both copyrights and patents, points out that the \xe2\x80\x9cmonopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [not] primarily designed to provide a special private benefit.  Rather, the limited grant is a means by which an important public purpose may be achieved.  It is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. by the provision of a special reward.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 429 (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Graham v.

Congress in particular cases may determine that copyright\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administrative costs, and restrictions on dissemination.  And when it does so, we must respect its judgment.  See Eldred, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 222.  But does the Clause empower Congress to enact a statute that withdraws works from the public domain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing so seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those who need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural pur- poses\xe2\x80\x94all without providing any additional incentive for the production of new material?  That is the question before us.  And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no.  Congress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any plausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible limits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act before us says that it \xe2\x80\x9crestores\xe2\x80\x9d American copyright to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not previously enjoy American copyright protection.  These works had fallen into America\xe2\x80\x99s public domain, but as of the \xe2\x80\x9crestoration\xe2\x80\x9d date, they had not yet fallen into the pub- lic domain of the foreign country where they originated.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe statute covers works originating almost anywhere outside the United States.  See \n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7104A(h)(3) (setting out eligibility criteria); U.\xc2\xa0S. Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the United States (2010).  The relevant set of works consists primarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain, or at some point lost, American copyright protection because (1) the author failed to comply with applicable American copyright formalities (such as notice or renewal), or (2) the nation in which they were first published then lacked copyright relations with the United States, or (3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972.  \xc2\xa7104A(h)(6)(C). A work must also satisfy other technical requirements: It must have had a rightholder who was a national or resident of an eligible country on the day it was created; and it cannot have been published in the United States within 30 days of its first publication.  \xc2\xa7104A(h)(6)(D).  The Act grants these works a copyright that expires at the time it would have expired had the author obtained a full American copyright term starting from the date on which the work was first published (in the foreign country).  \xc2\xa7104A(a)(1)(B).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act mainly applies to works first published abroad between 1923 and 1989.  It does not apply significantly to earlier works because any work published before 1921 would have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had it received a full American copyright term, while works published between 1921 and 1923 obtained a \xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d copyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two years at most.

It has less impact on more recent works because in 1989  the United States became a Berne member, abolished the copyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided prospective copyright protection throughout the Berne Union.

Congress has tried to ease the administrative burden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating prices for those whom the statute calls \xe2\x80\x9creliance part[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d namely those who previously had used such works when they were freely available in the public domain.  \xc2\xa7104A(h)(4).  But Congress has done nothing to ease the administrative burden of securing permission from copyright owners that is placed upon those who want to use a work that they did not previously use, and this is a particular problem when it comes to \xe2\x80\x9corphan works\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94older and more obscure works with minimal commercial value that have copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to track down.  Unusually high administrative costs threaten to limit severely the distribution and use of those works\xe2\x80\x94works which, despite their characteristic lack of economic value, can prove culturally invaluable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are millions of such works.  For example, according to European Union figures, there are 13 million orphan books in the European Union (13% of the total  number of books in-copyright there), 225,000 orphan films in European film archives, and 17 million orphan photographs in United Kingdom museums.

How is a university, a film collector, a musician, a database compiler, or a scholar now to obtain permission to  use any such lesser known foreign work previously in  the American public domain?  Consider the questions that any such individual, group, or institution usually must answer: Is the work eligible for restoration under the statute?  If so, who now holds the copyright\xe2\x80\x94the author? an heir? a publisher? an association? a long-lost cousin?  Whom must we contact?  What is the address?  Suppose no one answers?

They will tempt some potential users to \xe2\x80\x9csteal\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpirate\xe2\x80\x9d works rather than do without.  And piracy often begets piracy, breeding the destructive habit of taking copyrighted works without paying for them, even where payment is possible.  Such habits  ignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation  of new works, while reflecting a false belief that new creation appears by magic without thought or hope of compensation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI recognize that ordinary copyright protection also comes accompanied with dissemination-restricting royalty charges and administrative costs.  But here the restrictions work special harm.  For one thing, the foreign location of restored works means higher than ordinary administrative costs.  For another, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s technical requirements make it very difficult to establish whether a work has had its copyright restored by the statute.

In doing so, it reverses the payment expectations of those who used, or intended to use, works that they thought belonged to them.  Were Congress to act similarly with respect to well-established property rights, the problem would be obvious.  This statute analogously restricts, and thereby diminishes, Americans\xe2\x80\x99 preexisting freedom to use formerly public domain material in their expressive activities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, while the majority correctly observes that the dissemination-restricting harms of copyright normally present problems appropriate for legislation to resolve, ante, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332, the question is whether the Copyright Clause permits Congress seriously to exacerbate such a problem by taking works out of the public domain without a countervailing benefit.  This question is appropriate for judicial resolution.  Indeed, unlike Eldred where the Court had to decide a complicated line-drawing question\xe2\x80\x94when is a copyright term too long?\xe2\x80\x94here an easily administrable standard is available\xe2\x80\x94a standard that would require works that have already fallen into the public domain to stay there.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe several, just mentioned features of the present statute are important, for they distinguish it from other copyright laws. By removing material from the public domain, the statute, in literal terms, \xe2\x80\x9cabridges\xe2\x80\x9d a preexisting freedom to speak.  In practical terms, members of the public might well have decided what to say, as well as when and how to say it, in part by reviewing with a view to repeating, expression that they reasonably believed was, or would be, freely available.  Given these speech implications, it is not surprising that Congress has long sought to protect public domain material when revising the copyright laws.  See infra, at 19 (listing instances).  And this Court has assumed the particular importance of public domain material in roughly analogous circumstances.  See Graham, 383 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain\xe2\x80\x9d); Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., \n\n416 U.\xc2\xa0S. 470, \n484 (1974)\n (trade secret protection is not incompatible with \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy that matter once in the public domain must remain in the public domain\xe2\x80\x9d); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469, \n496 (1975)\n (\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits sanctioning press for publishing material disclosed in public court documents); see also Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 23, \n33 (2003)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe right to copy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. once a copyright has expired .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. passes to the public\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, whereas forward-looking copyright laws tend to benefit those whose identities are not yet known (the writer who has not yet written a book, the musician who has not yet composed a song), when a copyright law is primarily backward looking the risk is greater that Congress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense of badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to argue and present their case to Congress.  In Eldred, I thought this problem was severe.  See generally 537 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 243\xe2\x80\x93266 (dissenting opinion).  And in light of the fact that Congress, with one minor exception, heard testimony only from the representatives of existing copyright holders, who hoped that passage of the statute would enable them to benefit from reciprocal treatment of American authors abroad, infra, at 21, I cannot say that even here the problem, while much diminished, was nonexistent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI agree with the majority that, in doing so, this statute does not discriminate among speakers based on their viewpoints or subject matter.  Ante, at 27.  But such considerations do not exhaust potential \n \nFirst Amendment problems.  Cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8) (finding \n \nFirst Amendment problem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from using publicly available prescriber-identifying information in their marketing efforts in part because it \xe2\x80\x9cdisfavor[ed] specific speakers\xe2\x80\x9d); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622, \n659 (1994)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cRegulations that discriminate among media, or among different speakers within a single medium, often present serious \n \nFirst Amendment concerns\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaken together, these speech-related harms (e.g., restricting use of previously available material; reversing payment expectations; rewarding rent-seekers at the public\xe2\x80\x99s expense) at least show the presence of a \n \nFirst Amendment interest.  And that is enough.  For present purposes, I need not decide whether the harms to that interest show a violation of the \n \nFirst Amendment.  I need only point to the importance of interpreting the Constitution as a single document\xe2\x80\x94a document that we should not read as setting the Copyright Clause and the \n \nFirst Amendment at cross-purposes.  Nor need I advocate the application here of strict or specially heightened review.  I need only find that the \n \nFirst Amendment interest is important enough to require courts to scrutinize with some care the reasons claimed to justify the Act in order to determine whether they constitute reasonable copyright-related justifications for the serious harms, including speech-related harms, which the Act seems likely to  impose.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis statute does not serve copyright\xe2\x80\x99s traditional public ends, namely the creation of monetary awards that \xe2\x80\x9cmotivate the creative activity of authors,\xe2\x80\x9d Sony, 464 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 429, \xe2\x80\x9cencourag[e] individual effort,\xe2\x80\x9d Mazer, 347 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at 219, and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cserve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts,\xe2\x80\x9d  Twentieth Century Music, 422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 156.  The statute grants its \xe2\x80\x9crestored copyright[s]\xe2\x80\x9d only to works already produced.  It provides no monetary incentive to produce anything new.  Unlike other American copyright statutes from the time of the Founders onwards, including the statute at issue in Eldred, it lacks any significant copyright-related quid pro quo.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by referring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests that Congress may provide new or increased protection both to newly created and to previously created, works.  Ante, at 16, 18; Act of May 31, 1790, \xc2\xa71, \n\n1Stat.\n124 (conferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as old); Act of July 3, 1832, \xc2\xa73, \n\n4Stat.\n559 (authorizing new patents for past and future inventors who inadvertently failed to comply with applicable statutory formalities); McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202 (1843) (applying an act deeming a past or future inventor\xe2\x80\x99s patent valid despite it being briefly used by, for example, the inventor\xe2\x80\x99s employer).  I do not dispute that copyright power.  Insofar as such a statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly created material, it embodies copyright\xe2\x80\x99s traditional justification\xe2\x80\x94eliciting new production.  And I do not doubt that Congress may then also include existing works within the scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and administrative reasons.  See Eldred, 537 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 204, 214\xe2\x80\x93215 (describing equitable reasons for applying newly extended copyright terms to future and existing copyrights alike).  The statute before us, however, does not directly elicit any new production.  Compare id., at 204\xe2\x80\x93208; (majority opinion) (noting that statute\xe2\x80\x99s extended term would apply to newly created material, and finding that the determination of the likelihood of its eliciting new production in practice was a matter for Congress to determine), with id., at 243\xe2\x80\x93267 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the statute would elicit new material).  See also Walterscheid 219 (the 1790 Congress likely thought it was substituting federal protection for preexisting state common-law protections); Maher, Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension, and the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context, 49 J. Copyright Soc. USA 1021, 1023\xe2\x80\x931024, and n. 8 (2002) (numerical estimate suggesting that 1790 Act removed only a small number of books from public domain).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe other statutes to which the majority refers are private bills, statutes retroactively granting protection in wartime, or the like.  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9319; Act of Feb. 19, 1849, ch. 57, \n\n9Stat.\n763 (Levi Corson); Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 534, 18 Stat., pt. 3, p.\xc2\xa0618 (Tod Helmuth); Act of Feb. 17, 1898, ch. 29, \n\n30Stat.\n1396 (Judson Jones); Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11, \n\n41Stat.\n368; Act of Sept. 25, 1941, ch. 421, \n\n55Stat.\n732; see also Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815) (upholding a private bill restoring patent protection to a flour mill).  But special circumstances, like wars, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters, prevent the realization in practice of a reasonable expectation of securing or maintaining a preexisting right.  Private bills are designed to provide special exceptions for comparable equitable reasons.  See also Act of Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 215, \n\n27Stat.\n743 (similar, as far as I can tell).  To find in these laws an important analogy to the present law, which for the most part covers works that the author did not expect to protect in America (and often did not particularly want to protect), seems somewhat farfetched.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fact, Congressional practice shows the contrary.  It consists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation preventing the withdrawal of works from the public domain.  See, e.g., Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, \xc2\xa712, \n\n102Stat.\n2860 (the Act \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not provide copyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); Copyright Act of 1976, Tit.

And it specifically mentions the \xe2\x80\x9cdissemination of existing and future works\xe2\x80\x9d as determinative here.  Ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9323, and n.\xc2\xa025. The industry experts to whom the majority refers argue that copyright protection of already existing works can help, say, music publishers or film distributers raise prices, produce extra profits and consequently lead them to publish or distribute works they might otherwise have ignored.  But ordinarily a copyright\xe2\x80\x94since it is a monopoly on copying\xe2\x80\x94restricts dissemination of a work once produced compared to a competitive market.  And simply making the industry richer does not mean that the industry, when it makes an ordinary forward-looking economic calculus, will distribute works not previously distributed.  The industry experts might mean that temporary extra profits will lead them to invest in the development of a market, say, by advertising.  But this kind of argument, which can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods, ranging from kiwi fruit to Swedish furniture, has little  if anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial creation, which is the special concern of copyright protection.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the argument proves too much.  It is the kind of argument that the Stationers\xe2\x80\x99 Company might well have made and which the British Parliament rejected.  Cf. Patterson 154\xe2\x80\x93155 (describing failed booksellers\xe2\x80\x99 bill seeking protection from foreign competition through an extension of the copyright term).  It is the kind of argument that could justify a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawing from the public domain the works, say, of Hawthorne or of Swift or for that matter the King James Bible in order to encourage further publication of those works; and, it could even more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser known early works, perhaps those of the Venerable Bede.  The Court has not, to my knowledge, previously accepted such a rationale\xe2\x80\x94a rationale well removed from the special economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeatable costs of the initial creation of a \xe2\x80\x9cWriting.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supra, at 2.  And I fear that doing so would read the Copyright Clause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of those who are not themselves creators.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not surprising that the copyright holders\xe2\x80\x99 representatives who appeared before Congress did not emphasize this argument.  (With one minor exception only those representatives appeared, see generally Joint Hearing; the Copyright Office did not testify, id., at 239.)  Rather, they focused on the Berne Convention itself.  By that time, Congress had already protected all new works of Berne members.  But it had not provided additional protection to preexisting foreign works that were then in the American public domain.  Industry witnesses testified that withdrawing such works from the American public domain would permit foreign copyright owners to charge American consumers more for their products; and that, as a result, the United States would be able to persuade foreign countries to allow American holders of preexisting copyrights to charge foreign customers more money for their products.  See id., at 241 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive Director and General Counsel, International Intellectual Property Alliance) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ailure to [comply with Article 18] will .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. undermine the ability of the United States to press other countries to implement the same sort of protection in their implementing legislation currently pending in many legislatures around the globe\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 253 (statement of Matt Gerson, Vice President for Congressional Affairs, Motion Picture Assn. of America) (similar).  See also id., at 85 (statement of Xavier Becerra, House Judiciary Committee member) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]etroactivity .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is probably the best way to ensure that some of our older American works, anything from Motown, to \xe2\x80\x98Star Trek,\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98The Hardy Boys\xe2\x80\x99 get the protection in some of these emerging foreign markets.  It is important to ensure that countries no longer use our U.\xc2\xa0S. law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copyright protections to some of our own works\xe2\x80\x9d).  But see  id., at 272\xe2\x80\x93279 (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman of the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of Moviecraft Inc.) (testifying against restoration on grounds similar to those set out, supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an ar-gument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to obtain more money from the sales of existing products.  It is not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to promote or to protect the creative process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Third, the majority points out that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cgives [authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 30.  But insofar as it suggests that copyright should in general help authors obtain greater monetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests upon primarily European, but not American, copyright concepts.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the majority argues that this statutory provision is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obligations.  Ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x938.  The Treaty, in Article 18, says that the \xe2\x80\x9cConvention shall apply to all works which, at the moment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of the United States] have not yet fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept.\xc2\xa09, 1886, as revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221, 251.  The majority and Government say that this means we must protect the foreign works at issue here.  And since the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides incentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to speculate, for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that the statute might indirectly encourage production of new works by making the United States\xe2\x80\x99 place in the international copyright regime more secure.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the statute.  For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own making.  The United States obtained the benefits of Berne for many years despite its failure to enact a statute implementing Article 18.  But in 1994, the United States and other nations signed the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which enabled signatories to use World Trade Organization dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about other members\xe2\x80\x99 Berne Convention violations.  But at that time the Government, although it successfully secured reservations protecting other special features of American copyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation permitting the United States to keep some or all restored works in the American public domain.  And it made no effort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly authorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Article\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity principle.  See Art. 18(3), ibid.  (\xe2\x80\x9cThe application of [the retroactivity] principle shall be subject to any provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the Union\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); Gervais, Golan v. Holder: A Look at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Convention, 64 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. En Banc 147, 151\xe2\x80\x93152 (2011); Gard, 64 Vand. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. En Banc, at 206.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor another thing, the Convention does not require Congress to enact a statute that causes so much damage to public domain material.  Article 18(3) also states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe respective countries shall determine, each in so far as it is concerned, the conditions of application of this principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added).  Congress could have alleviated many of the costs that the statute imposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory licensing, requiring \xe2\x80\x9crestored copyright\xe2\x80\x9d holders to provide necessary administrative information as a condition of protection, or insisting upon \xe2\x80\x9creasonable royalties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. S.\xc2\xa02913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that would have limited judicial remedies against users of orphan works); H.\xc2\xa0R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (House version of same); American Society of Compos- ers, Authors and Publishers, http://www.ascap.com/ licensing/termsdefined.aspx (society of music copyright owners offering blanket licenses that give users the unlimited right to perform any of its members\xe2\x80\x99 songs for a fixed fee, thus reducing negotiation and enforcement costs).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo say this is not to criticize the Convention or our joining it.  Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of Government should have tried to follow the Convention and in particular its provisions offering compliance flexibility.  The fact that the statute has significant \n \nFirst Amendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that Amendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less restrictive, alternative possibilities.  Doing so here, reveals that neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of less-restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention itself provides.  And that fact means that the Convention cannot provide the statute with a constitutionally sufficient justification that is otherwise lacking.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe fact that, by withdrawing material from the public domain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow of information is sufficient, when combined with the other features of the statute that I have discussed, to convince me that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of the \n \nFirst Amendment, does not authorize Congress to enact this statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI respectfully dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary  conclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
