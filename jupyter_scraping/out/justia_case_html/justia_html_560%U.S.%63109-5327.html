FLORIDA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">HOLLAND <em>v</em>. FLORIDA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x935327.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 1, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Florida state court.  After the State Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal and denied collateral relief, Holland filed a <em>pro se</em> federal habeas corpus petition, which was approximately five weeks late under the 1-year statute of limitations set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d).  The record facts reveal, <em>inter alia,</em> that Holland\xe2\x80\x99s court-appointed attorney, Bradley Collins, had failed to file a timely federal petition, despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s many letters emphasizing the importance of doing so; that Collins apparently did not do the research necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite the fact that Holland had identified the applicable legal rules for him; that Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely manner that the State Supreme Court had decided his case, despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s many pleas for that information; and that Collins failed to communicate with Holland over a period of years, despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s pleas for responses to his letters.  Meanwhile, Holland repeatedly requested that the state courts and the Florida bar remove Collins from his case.  Based on these and other record facts, Holland asked the Federal District Court to toll the AEDPA limitations period for equitable reasons.  It refused, holding that he had not demonstrated the due diligence necessary to invoke equitable tolling.  Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, regardless of diligence, Holland\xe2\x80\x99s case did not constitute \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Specifically, it held that when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing based on his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional conduct, that conduct, even if grossly negligent, cannot  justify equitable tolling absent proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment, or the like.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Section 2244(d), the AEDPA statute of limitations, is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Several considerations support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  First, because AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations defense \xe2\x80\xa6 is not \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Day</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/198/index.html">547 U. S. 198</a>, 205, 213, it is subject to a \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable presumption\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>favor</em> \xe2\x80\x9cof equitable tolling,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 95\xe2\x80\x9396.  That presumption\xe2\x80\x99s strength is reinforced here by the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cequitable principles\xe2\x80\x9d have traditionally \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned\xe2\x80\x9d substantive habeas law.  <em>Munaf</em> v. <em>Geren</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/674/index.html">553 U. S. 674</a>, ___, and the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA after <em>Irwin</em> and therefore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s timing provisions, would apply the presumption, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Merck &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Reynolds</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___.  Second, \xc2\xa72244(d) differs significantly from the statutes at issue in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Brockamp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/347/index.html">519 U. S. 347</a>, 350\xe2\x80\x93352, and <em>United States</em> v. <em>Beggerly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/38/index.html">524 U. S. 38</a>, 49, in which the Court held that <em>Irwin\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>presumption had been overcome.  For example, unlike the subject matters at issue in those cases<em>\xe2\x80\x94</em>tax collection and land claims\xe2\x80\x94AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity finds a comfortable home.  See<em> Munaf, supra,</em> at ___.  <em>Brockamp, supra, </em>at 352, distinguished.  Moreover, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is neither unusually generous nor unusually complex.  Finally, the Court disagrees with respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that equitable tolling undermines AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose of eliminating delays in the federal habeas review process, see, <em>e.g., Day, supra, </em>at 205\xe2\x80\x93206.  AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas corpus principles and by harmonizing the statute with prior law, under which a petition\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness was always determined under equitable principles.  See, <em>e.g., Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 483.  Such harmonization, along with the Great Writ\xe2\x80\x99s importance as the only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s silence on equitable tolling as congressional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would keep open.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>per se</em> standard is too rigid.  A \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x9d if he shows \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\xe2\x80\x9d and prevented timely filing.  <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U. S. 408</a>, 418.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d are not limited to those that satisfy the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test.  Courts must often \xe2\x80\x9cexercise [their] equity powers \xe2\x80\xa6 on a case-by-case basis,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Baggett</em> v. <em>Bullitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/360/index.html">377 U. S. 360</a>, 375, demonstrating \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d and avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical rules,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Holmberg</em> v. <em>Armbrecht</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/392/index.html">327 U. S. 392</a>, 396, in order to \xe2\x80\x9crelieve hardships \xe2\x80\xa6 aris[ing] from a hard and fast adherence\xe2\x80\x9d to more absolute legal rules, <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co.</em> v. <em>Hartford-Empire Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/322/238/index.html">322 U. S. 238</a>, 248.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 753, distinguished.  No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  That rule is difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least sometimes, an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional conduct can be so egregious as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, as several other federal courts have specifically held.  Although equitable tolling is not warranted for \xe2\x80\x9ca garden variety claim of excusable neglect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Irwin, supra,</em> at 96, this case presents far more serious instances of attorney misconduct than that.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0While the record facts suggest that this case may well present \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary.  The District Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circumstances, but on a lack of diligence.  Here, Holland diligently pursued his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins be removed from his case, and by filing his own <em>pro se</em> habeas petition on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired.  Because the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not diligent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an overly rigid <em>per se</em> approach, no lower court has yet considered whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.  The Eleventh Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropriate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might indicate that the State should prevail.

See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d).  We also consider its application in this case.  In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis of his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional conduct, that conduct, even if it is \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly negligent,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot \xe2\x80\x9crise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d that would warrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers \xe2\x80\x9cproof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  In our view, this standard is too rigid.  See <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 96 (1990); see also <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/327/index.html"></a><a href="/us/549/327/index.html">549 U. S. 327</a>, 336 (2007).  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AEDPA states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1).  It also says that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction \xe2\x80\xa6 review\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cpending shall not be counted\xe2\x80\x9d against the 1-year period.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a <em>pro se</em> habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  Both Holland (the petitioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree that, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations period applicable to Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition expired approximately five weeks before the petition was filed.  See Brief for Respondent 9, and n.\xc2\xa07; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Holland asked the District Court to toll the limitations period for equitable reasons.  We shall set forth in some detail the record facts that underlie Holland\xe2\x80\x99s claim.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed that judgment.  <em>Holland </em>v. <em>State</em>, 773 So.\xc2\xa02d 1065 (Fla. 2000).  On <em>October 1, 2001</em>, this Court denied Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/834/index.html">534 U. S. 834</a>.  And on that date\xe2\x80\x94the date that our denial of the petition ended further direct review of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s conviction\xe2\x80\x94the 1-year AEDPA limitations clock began to run.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A); <em>Jimenez</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thirty-seven days later, on <em>November 7, 2001</em>, Florida appointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland in all state and federal postconviction proceedings.  Cf. Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa727.710, 27.711(2) (2007).  By <em>September 19, 2002</em>\xe2\x80\x94316 days after his appointment and 12 days before the 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired\xe2\x80\x94Collins, acting on Holland\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, filed a motion for postconviction relief in the state trial court.  Cf. Brief for Respondent 9, n.\xc2\xa07.  That filing automatically stopped the running of the AEDPA limitations period, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), with, as we have said, 12 days left on the clock.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the next three years, Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition remained pending in the state courts.  During that time, Holland wrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of his claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal habeas corpus review.  Collins wrote back, stating, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time limitations and federal exhaustion requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 55.  He also said that he would \xe2\x80\x9cpresen[t] \xe2\x80\xa6 to the \xe2\x80\xa6 federal courts\xe2\x80\x9d any of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the state courts denied.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In a second letter Collins added, \xe2\x80\x9cshould your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied\xe2\x80\x9d by the state courts, \xe2\x80\x9cyour state habeas corpus claims will then be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 61.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In mid-May 2003 the state trial court denied Holland relief, and Collins appealed that denial to the Florida Supreme Court.  Almost two years later, in February 2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  See 539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1337.  But during that 2-year period, relations between Collins and Holland began to break down.  Indeed, between April 2003 and January 2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three times\xe2\x80\x94each time by letter.  See No. 1:06\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9320182\xe2\x80\x93PAS (SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p.\xc2\xa07, n.\xc2\xa06 (hereinafter District Court opinion), App. 91, n.\xc2\xa06.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication, twice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to remove Collins from his case.  In the second letter, filed on June 17, 2004, he said that he and Collins had experienced \xe2\x80\x9ca complete breakdown in communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 160.  Holland informed the court that Collins had \xe2\x80\x9cnot kept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case\xe2\x80\x9d and that Holland had \xe2\x80\x9cnot seen or spoken to\xe2\x80\x9d Collins \xe2\x80\x9csince April 2003.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 150.  He wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Collins has abandoned [me]\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9c[I have] no idea what is going on with [my] capital case on appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 152.  He added that \xe2\x80\x9cCollins has never made any reasonable effort to establish any relationship of trust or confidence with [me],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 155, and stated that he \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not trust\xe2\x80\x9d or have \xe2\x80\x9cany confidence in Mr. Collin\xe2\x80\x99s ability to represent [him],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 152.  Holland concluded by asking that Collins be \xe2\x80\x9cdismissed (removed) off his capital case\xe2\x80\x9d or that he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins\xe2\x80\x99 deficiencies.  <em>Id.,</em> at 155, 161.  The State responded that Holland could not file any <em>pro se </em>papers with the court while he was represented by counsel, including papers seeking new counsel.  <em>Id.,</em> at 42\xe2\x80\x9345.  The Florida Supreme Court agreed and denied Holland\xe2\x80\x99s requests.  <em>Id.,</em> at 46.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During this same period Holland wrote various letters to the Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court.  In the last of these he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f I had a competent, conflict-free, postconviction, appellate attorney representing me, I would not have to write you this letter.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to get on your nerves.  I just would like to know <em>exactly </em>what is happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 147.  During that same time period, Holland also filed a complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar Association, but the complaint was denied.  <em>Id.,</em> at 65\xe2\x80\x9367.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Collins argued Holland\xe2\x80\x99s appeal before the Florida Supreme Court on February 10, 2005.  539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1337.  Shortly thereafter, Holland wrote to Collins emphasizing the importance of filing a timely petition for habeas corpus in federal court once the Florida Supreme Court issued its ruling.  Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Collins, P.\xc2\xa0A.:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?

But he called collect and Collins\xe2\x80\x99 office would not accept the call.  App. 218.  Five days later, Collins wrote to Holland and told him for the very first time that, as Collins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period applicable to Holland\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas application had in fact expired in 2000\xe2\x80\x94<em>before </em>Collins had begun to represent Holland.  Specifically, Collins wrote: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Holland:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI am in receipt of your letter dated January 20, 2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations.  One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining federal habeas corpus relief will be that the one-year statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to run after the case was affirmed on October 5, 2000<em> </em>[when your] Judgment and Sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 were affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  However, it was not until November 7, 2001, that I received the Order appointing me to the case.

As we have said, Holland\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limitations period did not begin to run until <em>this</em> Court denied Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari from the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 denial of relief on direct review, which occurred on October 1, 2001.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A); <em>Jimenez, </em>555 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); <em>Bond</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 309 F.\xc2\xa03d 770, 774 (CA11 2002).

Nor did he file a federal habeas petition as Holland requested.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar Association.  See Record, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p.\xc2\xa08.  This time the bar asked Collins to respond, which he did, through his own attorney, on March 21.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2<em>.</em>  And the very next day, over three months after Holland\xe2\x80\x99s AEDPA statute of limitations had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal habeas petition to Holland, asking him to review it.  See <em>id.</em>, Doc. 20, Exh. W.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But by that point Holland had already filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in the District Court asking that Collins be dismissed as his attorney.  App. 192.  The State responded to that request by arguing once again that Holland could not file a <em>pro se </em>motion seeking to have Collins removed while he was represented by counsel, <em>i.e., </em>represented by Collins.  See <em>id.</em>, at 47\xe2\x80\x9351.  But this time the court considered Holland\xe2\x80\x99s motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the case, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland.  See Record, Docs. 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 22.  And it also received briefing on whether the circumstances of the case justified the equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a sufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to make Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition timely.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court held that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and that consequently Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition was untimely.  The court, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings on Holland\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in the state courts, and suggesting that Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not hold, that Collins\xe2\x80\x99 professional conduct in the case was at worst merely \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent.\xe2\x80\x9d  See District Court opinion 7\xe2\x80\x938, App. 90\xe2\x80\x9393.  But the court rested its holding on an alternative rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbehavior could be characterized as an \xe2\x80\x98extraordinary circumstance,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Holland \xe2\x80\x9cdid not seek any help from the court system to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying his state habeas petition, nor did he seek aid from \xe2\x80\x98outside supporters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 8, App. 92.  Hence, the court held, Holland did not \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cdue diligence\xe2\x80\x9d necessary to invoke \xe2\x80\x9cequitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that Holland\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition was untimely.  The Court of Appeals first agreed with Holland that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[e]quitable tolling can be applied to \xe2\x80\xa6 AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory deadline.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1338 (quoting Helton</em> v. <em>Secretary for Dept. of Corrections</em>, 259 F.\xc2\xa03d 1310, 1312 (CA11 2001)).  But it also held that equitable tolling could not be applied in a case, like Holland\xe2\x80\x99s, that involves no more than \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ure professional negligence\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney because such behavior can never constitute an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1339.  The court wrote: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe will assume that Collins\xe2\x80\x99s alleged conduct is negligent, even grossly negligent.  But in our view, no allegation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s standard of care\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of an allegation and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x94can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nHolland made \xe2\x80\x9cno allegation\xe2\x80\x9d that Collins had made a \xe2\x80\x9cknowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,\xe2\x80\x9d or that he exhibited \xe2\x80\x9cdishonesty,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdivided loyalty,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmental impairment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</em>  Hence, the court held, equitable tolling was <em>per se </em>inapplicable to Holland\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  The court did not address the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling with respect to Holland\xe2\x80\x99s diligence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Holland petitioned for certiorari.  Because the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 application of the equitable tolling doctrine to instances of professional misconduct conflicts with the approach taken by other Circuits, we granted the petition.  Compare 539 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334 (case below), with, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Baldayaque</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 338 F.\xc2\xa03d 145, 152\xe2\x80\x93153 (CA2 2003) (applying a less categorical approach); <em>Spitsyn</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 345 F.\xc2\xa03d 796, 801\xe2\x80\x93802 (CA9 2003) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have not decided whether AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons.

In <em>Brockamp, </em>we interpreted a statute of limitations that was silent on the question of equitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine.  But in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1) \xe2\x80\x9cse[t] forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) used \xe2\x80\x9chighly detailed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical\xe2\x80\x9d language \xe2\x80\x9cthat, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d; (3) \xe2\x80\x9creiterate[d] its limitations several times in several different ways\xe2\x80\x9d; (4) related to an \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying subject matter,\xe2\x80\x9d nationwide tax collection, with respect to which the practical consequences of permitting tolling would have been substantial; and (5) would, if tolled, \xe2\x80\x9crequire tolling, not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of recovery\xe2\x80\x94a kind of tolling for which we \xe2\x80\xa6 found no direct precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 350\xe2\x80\x93352.  And in <em>Beggerly </em>we held that <em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s presumption was overcome where (1) the 12-year statute of limitations at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cunusually generous\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) the underlying claim \xe2\x80\x9cdeal[t] with ownership of land\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby implicated landowners\xe2\x80\x99 need to \xe2\x80\x9cknow with certainty what their rights are, and the period during which those rights may be subject to challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  524 U. S., at 48\xe2\x80\x9349.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By way of contrast, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Brockamp, </em>does not contain language that is \xe2\x80\x9cunusually emphatic,\xe2\x80\x9d nor does it \xe2\x80\x9cre-iterat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d its time limitation.  Neither would application of equitable tolling here affect the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d of a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Moreover, in contrast to the 12-year limitations period at issue in <em>Beggerly, </em>AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period is not particularly long.  And unlike the subject matters at issue in both <em>Brockamp </em>and <em>Beggerly\xe2\x80\x94</em>tax collection and land claims\xe2\x80\x94AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity finds a comfortable home.  See<em> Munaf, supra,</em> at 693.  In short, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year limit reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.  See <em>Calderon, supra</em>, at 1288.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent, citing <em>Brockamp, </em>argues that AEDPA should be interpreted to foreclose equitable tolling because the statute sets forth \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit exceptions to its basic time limits\xe2\x80\x9d that do \xe2\x80\x9cnot include \xe2\x80\x98equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  519 U. S., at 351; see Brief for Respondent 27.  The statute does contain multiple provisions relating to the events that <em>trigger </em>its running.  See \xc2\xa72244(d)(1); <em>Clay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/522/index.html">537 U. S. 522</a>, 529 (2003); see also <em>Cada</em> v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp.</em>, 920 F.\xc2\xa02d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe must \xe2\x80\xa6 distinguish between the <em>accrual</em> of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim and the <em>tolling</em> of the statute of limitations \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Wims</em> v. <em>United States, </em>225 F.\xc2\xa03d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same); <em>Wolin</em> v. <em>Smith Barney Inc.,</em> 83 F.\xc2\xa03d 847, 852 (CA7 1996) (same).  And we concede that it is silent as to equitable tolling while containing one provision that expressly refers to a different kind of tolling.  See \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) (stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he time during which\xe2\x80\x9d a petitioner has a pending request for state postconviction relief \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be counted toward\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9cperiod of limitation\xe2\x80\x9d under AEDPA).  But the fact that Congress <em>expressly </em>referred to tolling during state collateral review proceedings is easily explained without rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable tolling.  A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim without first exhausting state remedies\xe2\x80\x94a process that frequently takes longer than one year.  See <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a> (1982); \xc2\xa72254(b)(1)(A).  Hence, Congress had to explain how the limitations statute accounts for the time during which such state proceedings are pending.  This special need for an express provision undermines any temptation to invoke the interpretive maxim <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</em> (to include one item (<em>i.e.,</em> suspension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude other similar items (<em>i.e.</em>, equitable tolling)).  See <em>Young,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 53 (rejecting claim that an \xe2\x80\x9cexpress tolling provision, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations] period, demonstrates a statutory intent <em>not </em>to toll the [limitations] period\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that equitable tolling undermines AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes.  We recognize that AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process.  See <em>Day</em>, 547 U. S., at 205\xe2\x80\x93206; <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html">537 U. S. 322</a>, 337 (2003).  But AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas corpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new statute with prior law, under which a petition\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness was always determined under equitable principles.  See <em>Slack</em> v. <em>McDaniel, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/473/index.html">529 U. S. 473</a>, 483 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cAEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s present provisions \xe2\x80\xa6 incorporate earlier habeas corpus principles\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Day,</em> 547 U. S., at 202, n.\xc2\xa01; <em>id.,</em> at 214 (<f f="Times New Roman">Scalia<f f="Century Schoolbook">, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa724.2, pp. 1123\xe2\x80\x931136 (5th ed. 2005).  When Congress codified new rules governing this previously judicially managed area of law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9cwrit of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Slack, </em>529 U. S., at 483.  It did not seek to end every possible delay at all costs.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 483\xe2\x80\x93488.  The importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa02, along with congressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with prior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would ordinarily keep open.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s textual characteristics nor the statute\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes \xe2\x80\x9crebut\xe2\x80\x9d the<em> </em>basic<em> </em>presumption set forth in <em>Irwin.</em>  And we therefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that \xc2\xa72244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously made clear that a \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9centitled to equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x9d only if he shows \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\xe2\x80\x9d and prevented timely filing.  <em>Pace</em>, 544 U. S., at 418 (emphasis deleted).  In this case, the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d at issue involve an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy professional standards of care.  The Court of Appeals held that, where that is so, even attorney conduct that is \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly negligent\xe2\x80\x9d can never warrant tolling absent \xe2\x80\x9cbad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s part.\xe2\x80\x9d  539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1339.  But in our view, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 standard is too rigid.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have said that courts of equity \xe2\x80\x9cmust be governed by rules and precedents no less than the courts of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lonchar</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/314/index.html">517 U. S. 314</a>, 323 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But we have also made clear that often the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of a court\xe2\x80\x99s equity powers \xe2\x80\xa6 must be made on a case-by-case basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Baggett</em> v. <em>Bullitt</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/360/index.html">377 U. S. 360</a>, 375 (1964).  In emphasizing the need for \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility,\xe2\x80\x9d for avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical rules,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Holmberg</em> v. <em>Armbrecht</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/327/392/index.html">327 U. S. 392</a>, 396 (1946)<em>, </em>we have followed a tradition in which courts of equity have sought to \xe2\x80\x9crelieve hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and fast adherence\xe2\x80\x9d to more absolute legal rules, which, if strictly applied, threaten the \xe2\x80\x9cevils of archaic rigidity,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co.</em> v. <em>Hartford-Empire Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/322/238/index.html">322 U. S. 238</a>, 248 (1944).  The \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d inherent in \xe2\x80\x9cequitable procedure\xe2\x80\x9d enables courts \xe2\x80\x9cto meet new situations [that] demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to correct \xe2\x80\xa6 particular injustices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (permitting postdeadline filing of bill of review).  Taken together, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.  Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that, in the context of procedural default, we have previously stated, without qualification, that a petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cmust \xe2\x80\x98bear the risk of attorney error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 752\xe2\x80\x93753 (1991).  But <em>Coleman</em> was \xe2\x80\x9ca case about federalism,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 726, in that it asked whether <em>federal</em> courts may excuse a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with a <em>state court\xe2\x80\x99s</em> procedural rules, notwithstanding the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that its own rules had been violated.  Equitable tolling, by contrast, asks whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with <em>federal</em> timing rules, an inquiry that does not implicate a state court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of state law.  Cf. <em>Lawrence</em>, 549 U. S., at 341 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  Holland does not argue that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct provides a substantive ground for relief, cf. \xc2\xa72254(i), nor is this a case that asks whether AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations should be recognized at all, cf. <em>Day</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 209.  Rather, this case asks how equity should be applied once the statute is recognized.  And given equity\xe2\x80\x99s resistance to rigid rules, we cannot read <em>Coleman</em> as requiring a <em>per se </em>approach in this context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, no pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands a rule like the one set forth by the Eleventh Circuit in this case.  That rule is difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard could nonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling.  And, given the long history of judicial application of equitable tolling, courts can easily find precedents that can guide their judgments.  Several lower courts have specifically held that unprofessional attorney conduct may, in certain circumstances, prove \xe2\x80\x9cegregious\xe2\x80\x9d and can be \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d even though the conduct in question may not satisfy the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Nara</em> v. <em>Frank, </em>264 F.\xc2\xa03d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering hearing as to whether client who was \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively abandoned\xe2\x80\x9d by lawyer merited tolling); <em>Calderon, </em>128 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1289 (allowing tolling where client was prejudiced by a last minute change in representation that was beyond his control); <em>Baldayaque, </em>338 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 152\xe2\x80\x93153 (finding that where an attorney failed to perform an essential service, to communicate with the client, and to do basic legal research, tolling could, under the circumstances, be warranted); <em>Spitsyn, </em>345 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 800\xe2\x80\x93802 (finding that \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d may warrant tolling where lawyer denied client access to files, failed to prepare a petition, and did not respond to his client\xe2\x80\x99s communications); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martin</em>, 408 F.\xc2\xa03d 1089, 1096 (CA8 2005) (client entitled to equitable tolling where his attorney retained files, made misleading statements, and engaged in similar conduct).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have previously held that \xe2\x80\x9ca garden variety claim of excusable neglect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Irwin,</em> 498 U. S., at 96, such as a simple \xe2\x80\x9cmiscalculation\xe2\x80\x9d that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline, <em>Lawrence,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 336, does not warrant equitable tolling.  But the case before us does not involve, and we are not considering, a \xe2\x80\x9cgarden variety claim\xe2\x80\x9d of attorney negligence.  Rather, the facts of this case present far more serious instances of attorney misconduct.  And, as we have said, although the circumstances of a case must be \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d before equitable tolling can be applied, we hold that such circumstances are not limited to those that satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this opinion suggest that this case may well be an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d instance in which petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s conduct constituted far more than \xe2\x80\x9cgarden variety\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexcusable neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d  To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland\xe2\x80\x99s petition on time and appears to have been unaware of the date on which the limitations period expired\xe2\x80\x94two facts that, alone, might suggest simple negligence.  But, in these circumstances, the record facts we have elucidated suggest that the failure amounted to more: Here, Collins failed to file Holland\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition on time despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s many letters that repeatedly emphasized the importance of his doing so.  Collins apparently did not do the research necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s letters that went so far as to identify the applicable legal rules.  Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely manner about the crucial fact that the Florida Supreme Court had decided his case, again despite Holland\xe2\x80\x99s many pleas for that information.  And Collins failed to communicate with his client over a period of years, despite various pleas from Holland that Collins respond to his letters.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A group of teachers of legal ethics tells us that these various failures violated fundamental canons of professional responsibility, which require attorneys to perform reasonably competent legal work, to communicate with their clients, to implement clients\xe2\x80\x99 reasonable requests, to keep their clients informed of key developments in their cases, and never to abandon a client.  See Brief for Legal Ethics Professors et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> (describing ethical rules set forth in case law, the Restatements of Agency, the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers (1998), and in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2009)).  And in this case, the failures seriously prejudiced a client who thereby lost what was likely his single opportunity for federal habeas review of the lawfulness of his imprisonment and of his death sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not state our conclusion in absolute form, however, because more proceedings may be necessary.  The District Court rested its ruling not on a lack of extraordinary circumstances, but rather on a lack of diligence\xe2\x80\x94a ruling that respondent does not defend.  See Brief for Respondent 38, n.\xc2\xa019; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 52.  We think that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was incorrect.  The diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable diligence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lonchar, </em>517 U. S., at 326, not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cmaximum feasible diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Starns</em> v. <em>Andrews, </em>524 F.\xc2\xa03d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting <em>Moore</em> v. <em>Knight</em>, 368 F.\xc2\xa03d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)).  Here, Holland not only wrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction; he also repeatedly contacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida State Bar Association in an effort to have Collins\xe2\x80\x94the central impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy\xe2\x80\x94removed from his case.  And, the <em>very day</em> that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to Collins\xe2\x80\x99 failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition <em>pro se </em>and promptly filed it with the District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack of diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an overly rigid <em>per se</em> approach, no lower court has yet considered in detail the facts of this case to determine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant equitable relief.  We are \xe2\x80\x9c[m]indful that this is a court of final review and not first view.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mineta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/103/index.html">534 U. S. 103</a>, 110 (2001) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  And we also recognize the prudence, when faced with an \xe2\x80\x9cequitable, often fact-intensive\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, of allowing the lower courts \xe2\x80\x9cto undertake it in the first instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/524/index.html">545 U. S. 524</a>, 540 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, because we conclude that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination must be set aside, we leave it to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the facts in this record entitle Holland to equitable tolling, or whether further proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing, might indicate that respondent should prevail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963329">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nOPINION OF ALITO, J.<br/>\nHOLLAND V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and second, assuming an affirmative answer to the first question, whether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts that are sufficient to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d prong of the equitable tolling test.  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that equitable tolling is available under AEDPA.  I also agree with much of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion concerning whether equitable tolling is available on the facts of this particular case.  In particular, I agree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limiting the relevant inquiry to the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d of counsel may be an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling.  As the Court makes clear, petitioner in this case has alleged certain facts that go well beyond any form of attorney negligence, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 19, and the Court of Appeals does not appear to have asked whether those particular facts provide an independent basis for tolling.  Accordingly, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reverse the judgment below and remand so that the lower courts may properly apply the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I agree that the Court of Appeals applied the <em>wrong</em> standard, I think that the majority does not do enough to explain the <em>right</em> standard.  It is of course true that equitable tolling requires \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d but that conclusory formulation does not provide much guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the many habeas petitions filed every year.  I therefore write separately to set forth my understanding of the principles governing the availability of equitable tolling in cases involving attorney misconduct.  </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pace </em>v.<em> DiGuglielmo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/408/index.html">544 U.

The dispute in this case concerns whether and when attorney misconduct amounts to an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d that stands in a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a timely petition.  I agree with the majority that it is not practical to attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation of the kinds of situations in which attorney misconduct may provide a basis for equitable tolling.  In my view, however, it is useful to note that several broad principles may be distilled from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, our prior cases make it abundantly clear that attorney negligence is not an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling.  In <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/327/index.html">549 U. S. 327</a>, 336 (2007), the Court expressly rejected the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that \xe2\x80\x9chis counsel\xe2\x80\x99s mistake in miscalculating the limitations period entitle[d] him to equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cAttorney miscalculation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cis simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, <em>particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (citing <em>Coleman </em>v.<em> Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 756\xe2\x80\x93757 (1991) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic rationale for <em>Lawrence</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding is that the mistakes of counsel are constructively attributable to the client, at least in the postconviction context.  The <em>Lawrence </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Coleman</em> is instructive.  In <em>Coleman</em>, the Court addressed whether attorney error provided cause for a procedural default based on a late filing.  See 501 U. S., at 752.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In such circumstances, the Court reasoned, there was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no inequity in requiring [the petitioner] to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Carrier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/478/index.html">477 U. S. 478</a>, 488 (1986)); accord, <em>Coleman, </em>501 U. S.,<em> </em>at 753 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[C]ause\xe2\x80\x99 under the cause and prejudice test must be something <em>external</em> to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cAttorney ignorance or inadvertence is not \xe2\x80\x98cause\xe2\x80\x99 because the attorney is the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must \xe2\x80\x98bear the risk of attorney error\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 754 (what matters is whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe error [of counsel] must be seen as an external factor, <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x98imputed to the State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid. </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cIn the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 757 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas\xe2\x80\x9d).  As <em>Lawrence</em> makes clear, the same analysis applies when a petitioner seeks equitable tolling based on attorney error in the postconviction context.  See<em> </em>549 U. S., at 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (citing <em>Coleman</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While <em>Lawrence</em> addressed an allegation of attorney miscalculation, its rationale fully applies to other forms of attorney negligence.  Instead of miscalculating the filing deadline, for example, an attorney could compute the deadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on time, mail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do the requisite research to determine the applicable deadline.  In any case, however, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s error would be constructively attributable to the client.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline involves \xe2\x80\x9cgross negligence\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of counsel does not by itself establish an extraordinary circumstance.  As explained above, the principal rationale for disallowing equitable tolling based on ordinary attorney miscalculation is that the error of an attorney is constructively attributable to the client and thus is not a circumstance beyond the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s control.  See <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 336\xe2\x80\x93337; <em>Coleman</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 752\xe2\x80\x93754; see also <em>Powell </em>v.<em> Davis</em>, 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 722, 727 (CA7 2005); <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>McBride</em>, 381 F.\xc2\xa03d 587, 589\xe2\x80\x93590 (CA7 2004); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Hutchinson</em>, 209 F.\xc2\xa03d 325, 330 (CA4 2000).  That rationale plainly applies regardless whether the attorney error in question involves ordinary or gross negligence.  See <em>Coleman</em>, 501 U. S., at 754 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, <em>i.e.,</em> \xe2\x80\x98imputed to the State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 752 (rejecting the contention that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he late filing was \xe2\x80\xa6 the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the default in federal habeas\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving <em>gross</em> rather than <em>ordinary</em> attorney negligence would not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be impractical in the extreme.  Missing the statute of limitations will generally, if not always, amount to negligence, see <em>Lawrence, </em>549 U. S., at 336, and it has been aptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.  Therefore, if gross negligence may be enough for equitable tolling, there will be a basis for arguing that tolling is appropriate in almost every counseled case involving a missed deadline.  See <em>ibid. </em>(argument that attorney miscalculation is an extraordinary circumstance, if credited, \xe2\x80\x9cwould essentially equitably toll limitations periods for every person whose attorney missed a deadline\xe2\x80\x9d).  This would not just impose a severe burden on the district courts; it would also make the availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial distinction between gross and ordinary negligence.  That line would be hard to administer, would needlessly consume scarce judicial resources, and would almost certainly yield inconsistent and often unsatisfying results.  See <em>Baldayaque</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 338 F.\xc2\xa03d 145, 155 (CA2 2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinction between ordinary and extraordinary attorney malpractice \xe2\x80\xa6 is elusive, hard to apply, and counterintuitive\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that distinguishes between ordinary and gross attorney negligence for purposes of the equitable tolling analysis would have demonstrably \xe2\x80\x9cinequitable\xe2\x80\x9d consequences.  For example, it is hard to see why a habeas petitioner should be effectively penalized just because his counsel was negligent rather than grossly negligent, or why the State should be penalized just because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel was grossly negligent rather than moderately negligent.  Regardless of how one characterizes counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance in such cases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the untimely filing, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late filing, and the governmental interest in enforcing the statutory limitations period is the same.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although attorney negligence, however styled, does not  provide a basis for equitable tolling, the AEDPA statute of limitations may be tolled if the missed deadline results from attorney misconduct that is not constructively attributable to the petitioner.  In this case, petitioner alleges facts that amount to such misconduct.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19 (acknowledging that ordinary attorney negligence does not warrant equitable tolling, but observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts of this case present far more serious instances of attorney misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  In particular, he alleges that his attorney essentially \xe2\x80\x9cabandoned\xe2\x80\x9d him, as evidenced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s near-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to respond to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s many inquiries and requests over a period of several years.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Petitioner also appears to allege that he made reasonable efforts to terminate counsel due to his inadequate representation and to proceed <em>pro se</em>, and that such efforts were successfully opposed by the State on the perverse ground that petitioner failed to act through appointed counsel.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4; Brief for Petitioner 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (stating that petitioner filed \xe2\x80\x9ctwo <em>pro se </em>motions in the Florida Supreme Court to remove Collins as counsel (one which, if granted, would have allowed [petitioner] to proceed <em>pro se</em>)\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If true, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.  Common sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.  See <em>Coleman</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 754 (relying on \xe2\x80\x9cwell-settled principles of agency law\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether attorney error was attributable to client); <em>Baldayaque</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 154 (Jacobs, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen an \xe2\x80\x98agent acts in a manner completely adverse to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98principal is not charged with [the] agent\xe2\x80\x99s misdeeds\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is particularly so if the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable efforts to terminate the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s representation have been thwarted by forces wholly beyond the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s control.  The Court of Appeals apparently did not consider petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s abandonment argument or assess whether the State improperly prevented petitioner from either obtaining new representation or assuming the responsibility of representing himself.  Accordingly, I agree with the majority that the appropriate disposition is to reverse and remand so that the lower courts may apply the correct standard to the facts alleged here.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963330">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nHOLLAND V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d).  The Court concludes that this time limit is also<em> </em>subject to equitable tolling, even for attorney errors that are ordinarily attributable to the client.  And it rejects the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Albert Holland is not entitled to tolling, without explaining why the test that court applied was wrong or what rule it should have applied instead.  In my view \xc2\xa72244(d) leaves no room for equitable exceptions, and Holland could not qualify even if it did.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is correct, <em>ante</em>, at 13, that we ordinarily presume federal limitations periods are subject to equitable tolling unless tolling would be inconsistent with the statute.  <em>Young</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/43/index.html">535 U. S. 43</a>, 49 (2002).  That is especially true of limitations provisions applicable to actions that are traditionally governed by equitable principles\xe2\x80\x94a category that includes habeas proceedings.  See <em>id.</em>, at 50.  If \xc2\xa72244(d) merely created a limitations period for federal habeas applicants, I agree that applying equitable tolling would be appropriate.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But \xc2\xa72244(d) does much more than that, establishing a detailed scheme regarding the filing deadline that addresses an array of contingencies.  In an ordinary case, the clock starts when the state-court judgment becomes final on direct review.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But the statute delays the start date\xe2\x80\x94thus effectively tolling the limitations period\xe2\x80\x94in cases where (1) state action unlawfully impeded the prisoner from filing his habeas application, (2) the prisoner asserts a constitutional right newly recognized by this Court and made retroactive to collateral cases, or (3) the factual predicate for the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claim could not previously have been discovered through due diligence.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D).  It also expressly tolls the limitations period during the pendency of a properly filed application for state collateral relief.  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Congress, in short, has considered and accounted for specific circumstances that in its view excuse an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s delay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question, therefore, is not whether \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s time bar is subject to tolling, but whether it is consistent with \xc2\xa72244(d) for federal courts to toll the time bar for <em>additional</em> reasons beyond those Congress included.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view it is not.  It is fair enough to infer, when a statute of limitations says nothing about equitable tolling, that Congress did not displace the default rule.  But when Congress has <em>codified</em> that default rule and specified the instances where it applies, we have no warrant to extend it to other cases.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Beggerly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/38/index.html">524 U. S. 38</a>, 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (1998).  Unless the Court believes \xc2\xa72244(d) contains an implicit, across-the-board exception that subsumes (and thus renders unnecessary) \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D) and (d)(2), it must rely on the untenable assumption that when Congress enumerated the events that toll the limitations period\xe2\x80\x94with no indication the list is merely illustrative\xe2\x80\x94it implicitly authorized courts to add others as they see fit.  We should assume the opposite: that by specifying situations in which an equitable principle applies to a specific requirement, Congress has displaced courts\xe2\x80\x99 discretion to develop ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions.  Cf. <em>Lonchar</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/314/index.html">517 U. S. 314</a>, 326\xe2\x80\x93328 (1996).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s responses are unpersuasive.  It brushes aside \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(D), apparently because those subdivisions merely delay the <em>start</em> of the limitations period but do not suspend a limitations period already underway.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  But the Court does not explain why that distinction makes any difference,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and we have described a rule that forestalls the start of a limitations period as \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively allow[ing] for equitable tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beggerly</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 48.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does address \xc2\xa72244(d)(2), which undeniably provides for poststart tolling, but dismisses it on the basis that Congress had to resolve a contradiction between \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s 1-year time bar and the rule of <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Lundy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/509/index.html">455 U. S. 509</a> (1982), that a federal habeas application cannot be filed while state proceedings are pending.  But there is no contradiction to resolve unless, in the absence of a statutory tolling provision, equitable tolling would <em>not</em> apply to a state prisoner barred from filing a federal habeas application while he exhausts his state remedies.  The Court offers no reason why it would not, and our holding in <em>Young, </em>535 U. S., at 50\xe2\x80\x9351, that tolling was justified by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to pursue a claim because of the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s automatic stay, 11 U.

Where equitable tolling is available, we have held that a litigant is entitled to it only if he has diligently pursued his rights and\xe2\x80\x94the requirement relevant here\xe2\x80\x94if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/327/index.html">549 U.

Because the attorney is the litigant\xe2\x80\x99s agent, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s acts (or failures to act) within the scope of the representation are treated as those of his client, see <em>Link</em> v. <em>Wabash R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/626/index.html">370 U. S. 626</a>, 633\xe2\x80\x93634, and n.\xc2\xa010 (1962), and thus such acts (or failures to act) are necessarily not extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the rule that an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s acts and oversights are attributable to the client is relaxed where the client has a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.  Where a State is constitutionally obliged to provide an attorney but fails to provide an effective one, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failures that fall below the standard set forth in <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), are chargeable to the State, not to the prisoner.  See <em>Murray</em> v. <em>Carrier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/478/index.html">477 U. S. 478</a>, 488 (1986).  But where the client has no right to counsel\xe2\x80\x94which in habeas proceedings he does not\xe2\x80\x94the rule holding him responsible for his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s acts applies with full force.  See <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 752\xe2\x80\x93754 (1991).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Thus, when a state habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal is filed too late because of attorney error, the petitioner is out of luck\xe2\x80\x94no less than if he had proceeded <em>pro se</em> and neglected to file the appeal himself.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress could, of course, have included errors by state-appointed habeas counsel as a basis for delaying the limitations period, but it did not.  Nor was that an oversight: Section 2244(d)(1)(B) expressly allows tolling for state-created impediments that prevent a prisoner from filing his application, but <em>only if</em> the impediment violates the Constitution or federal law.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>If there were any doubt that equitable tolling is unavailable under \xc2\xa72244(d) to excuse attorney error, we eliminated it in <em>Lawrence</em>.  The petitioner there asserted that his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s miscalculation of the limitations period for federal habeas applications caused him to miss the filing deadline.  The attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error stemmed from his mistaken belief that\xe2\x80\x94contrary to Circuit precedent (which we approved in <em>Lawrence</em>)\xe2\x80\x94the limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a petition for certiorari from a state postconviction proceeding.  549 U. S., at 336; see also Brief for Petitioner in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, O. T. 2006, No. 05\xe2\x80\x938820, pp.<em> </em>31, 36.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that equitable tolling could ever apply to \xc2\xa72244(d), we held that such attorney error did not warrant it, especially since the petitioner was not constitutionally entitled to counsel.  <em>Lawrence</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 336\xe2\x80\x93337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faithful application of <em>Lawrence</em> should make short work of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Although Holland alleges a wide array of misconduct by his counsel, Bradley Collins, the only pertinent part appears extremely similar, if not identical, to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error in <em>Lawrence</em>.  The relevant time period extends at most from November 10, 2005\xe2\x80\x94when the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas petition[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]\xe2\x80\x94to December 15, 2005, the latest date on which \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations period could have expired.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Within that period, Collins could have alerted Holland to the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and either Collins or Holland himself could have filed a timely federal habeas application.  Collins did not do so, but instead filed a petition for certiorari several months later.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why Collins did not notify Holland or file a timely federal application for him is unclear, but none of the plausible explanations would support equitable tolling.  By far the most likely explanation is that Collins made exactly the same mistake as the attorney in <em>Lawrence</em>\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, he assumed incorrectly that the pendency of a petition for certiorari in this Court seeking review of the denial of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas petition would toll AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s time bar under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  In December 2002, Collins had explained to Holland by letter that if his state habeas petition was denied <em>and</em> this Court denied certiorari in that proceeding, Holland\xe2\x80\x99s claims \xe2\x80\x9c<em>will then be ripe</em> for presentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 61 (emphasis added).  Holland himself interprets that statement as proof that, at that time, \xe2\x80\x9cCollins was under the belief that [Holland\xe2\x80\x99s] time to file his federal habeas petition would continue to be tolled until this Court denied certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d in his state postconviction proceeding.  Pet. for Cert. 12, n.\xc2\xa010.  That misunderstanding would entirely account for Collins\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94filing a certiorari petition instead of a habeas application, and waiting nearly three months to do so.  But it would also be insufficient, as <em>Lawrence </em>held it was,<em> </em>to warrant tolling.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The other conceivable explanations for Collins\xe2\x80\x99s failure fare no better.  It may be that Collins believed\xe2\x80\x94as he explained to Holland in a January 2006 letter, after Holland had informed him that a certiorari petition in a state postconviction proceeding would not stop the clock\xe2\x80\x94that the certiorari petition in Holland\xe2\x80\x99s <em>direct</em> appeal also did not toll the time bar.  Consequently, Collins wrote, Holland\xe2\x80\x99s time to file a federal application had expired even before Collins was appointed.  App. 78\xe2\x80\x9379.  As the Court explains, <em>ante</em>, at 8, this view too was wrong, but it is no more a basis for equitable tolling than the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstanding in <em>Lawrence</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Or it may be that Collins (despite what he wrote to Holland) correctly understood the rule but simply neglected to notify Holland; perhaps he missed the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in his mail, or perhaps it simply slipped his mind.  Such an oversight is unfortunate, but it amounts to \xe2\x80\x9cgarden variety\xe2\x80\x9d negligence, not a basis for equitable tolling.  <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html"></a><a href="/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 96 (1990). <em> </em>Surely it is no more extraordinary than the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error in <em>Lawrence</em>, which rudimentary research and arithmetic would have avoided.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court insists that Collins\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct goes beyond garden-variety neglect and mine-run miscalculation.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  But the only differences it identifies had no effect on Holland\xe2\x80\x99s ability to file his federal application on time.  The Court highlights Collins\xe2\x80\x99s nonresponsiveness while Holland\xe2\x80\x99s state postconviction motions were still pending.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  But even taken at face value, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s silence <em>prior </em>to November 10, 2005, did not prevent Holland from filing a timely federal application once the Florida courts were finished with his case.  The Court also appears to think significant Collins\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence with Holland in January 2006, <em>after</em> the limitations period had elapsed.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310, 20.  But unless Holland can establish that the time-bar should be tolled due to events <em>before </em>December 15, 2005, any misconduct by Collins after the limitations period elapsed is irrelevant.  Even if Collins\xe2\x80\x99s conduct before November 10 and after December 15 was \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d Holland has not shown that it \xe2\x80\x9cstood in his way and prevented timely filing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lawrence</em>, 549 U. S., at 336 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For his part, Holland now asserts that Collins did not merely forget to keep his client informed, but deliberately deceived him.  As the Court of Appeals concluded, however, Holland did not allege deception in seeking equitable tolling below.  See 539 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In any event, the deception of which he complains consists only of Collins\xe2\x80\x99s assurance early in the representation that he would protect Holland\xe2\x80\x99s ability to assert his claims in federal court, see App. 55, 62, coupled with Collins\xe2\x80\x99s later failure to do so.  That, of course, does not by itself amount to deception, and Holland offers no evidence that Collins meant to mislead him.  Moreover, Holland can hardly claim to have been caught off guard.  Collins\xe2\x80\x99s failures to respond to Holland\xe2\x80\x99s repeated requests for information <em>before</em> the State Supreme Court ruled gave Holland even greater reason to suspect that Collins had fallen asleep at the switch.  Holland indeed was under no illusion to the contrary, as his repeated efforts to replace Collins reflect.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite its insistence that <em>Lawrence</em> does not control this case, the Court does not actually hold that Holland is entitled to equitable tolling.  It concludes only that the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong rule and remands the case for a re-do.  That would be appropriate if the Court identified a legal error in the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and set forth the proper standard it should have applied.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does neither.  It rejects as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo rigid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 17, the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test\xe2\x80\x94which requires, beyond ordinary attorney negligence, \xe2\x80\x9can allegation and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s part,\xe2\x80\x9d 539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1339.  But the Court never explains why that \xe2\x80\x9cor so forth\xe2\x80\x9d test, which explicitly leaves room for other kinds of egregious attorney error, is insufficiently elastic.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if the Eleventh Circuit had adopted an entirely inflexible rule, it is simply untrue that, as the Court appears to believe, <em>ante</em>, at 17, all general rules are <em>ipso facto </em>incompatible with equity.  We have rejected that canard before, see, <em>e.g., Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/308/index.html">527 U. S. 308</a>, 321\xe2\x80\x93322 (1999), and we have relied on the existence of general rules regarding equitable tolling in particular, see, <em>e.g., Young</em>, 535 U. S., at 53.  As we observed in rejecting ad\xc2\xa0hoc equitable <em>restrictions </em>on habeas relief, \xe2\x80\x9cthe alternative is to use each equity chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s conscience as a measure of equity, which alternative would be as arbitrary and uncertain as measuring distance by the length of each chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lonchar</em>, 517 U. S., at 323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with its failure to explain the error in the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test, the Court offers almost no clue about what test that court should have applied.  The Court unhelpfully advises the Court of Appeals that its test is too narrow, with no explanation besides the assertion that its test left out cases where tolling might be warranted, and no precise indication of what those cases might be.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[A]t least sometimes, professional misconduct that fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard could nonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>The Court says that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts can easily find precedents that can guide their judgments,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, citing several Court of Appeals opinions that (in various contexts) permit tolling for attorney error\xe2\x80\x94but notably omitting opinions that disallow it, such as the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 722, 727 (2005), which would have \xe2\x80\x9cguide[d]\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0judgmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d precisely where this court arrived: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ttorney misconduct, whether labeled negligent, grossly negligent, or willful, is attributable to the client and thus is not a circumstance beyond a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s control that might excuse an untimely petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only thing the Court offers that approaches substantive instruction is its implicit approval of \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental canons of professional responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d articulated by an ad\xc2\xa0hoc group of legal-ethicist <em>amici</em> consisting mainly of professors of that least analytically rigorous and hence most subjective of law-school subjects, legal ethics.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  The Court does not even try to justify importing into equity the \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms\xe2\x80\x9d we have held implicit in the right to counsel, <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 688.  In his habeas action Holland has no right to counsel.  I object to this transparent attempt to smuggle <em>Strickland</em> into a realm the Sixth Amendment does not reach.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to articulate an intelligible rule regarding the only issue actually before us stands in sharp contrast to its insistence on deciding an issue that is <em>not </em>before us: whether Holland satisfied the second prerequisite for equitable tolling by demonstrating that he pursued his rights diligently, see <em>Pace</em>, 544 U. S., at 418\xe2\x80\x93419.  As the Court admits, only the District Court addressed that question below; the Eleventh Circuit had no need to reach it.  More importantly, it is not even arguably included within the question presented, which concerns only whether an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s gross negligence can constitute an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d of the kind we have held essential for equitable tolling.  Pet. for Cert. i.  Whether tolling is <em>ever</em> available is fairly included in that question, but whether Holland has overcome an additional, independent hurdle to tolling is not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court offers no justification for deciding this distinct issue.  The closest it comes is its observation that the State \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not defend\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling regarding diligence.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But the State had no reason to do so\xe2\x80\x94any more than it had reason to address the merits of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s habeas claims.  Nor, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s implication, has the State conceded the issue.  The footnote of the State\xe2\x80\x99s brief which the Court cites did just the opposite: After observing that only the extraordinary-circumstance prong of the equitable-tolling test is at issue, the State (perhaps astutely apprehensive that the Court might ignore that fact) added that \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent the Court considers the matter\xe2\x80\x9d of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s diligence, \xe2\x80\x9cRespondent relies on the findings of the district court below.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 38, n.\xc2\xa019.  The Court also cites a statement by the State\xe2\x80\x99s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, and Holland\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of it as a concession, <em>id.</em>, at 52.  But the remark, in context, shows only that the State does not dispute diligence <em>in this Court</em>, where the only issue is extraordinary circumstances:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that goes to the issue\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0of diligence, of course, which is not the issue we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.  We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the extraordinary circumstances, not the diligence\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e\xe2\x80\x99ll concede diligence for the moment . . . . \xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the Court\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that the District Court was wrong, it is not even clear that Holland acted with the requisite diligence.  Although Holland repeatedly contacted Collins and the state courts, there were other reasonable measures Holland could have pursued.  For example, as we suggested in <em>Pace, supra</em>, at 416\xe2\x80\x94decided while Holland\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas petition was still pending\xe2\x80\x94Holland might have filed a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98protective\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d federal habeas application and asked the District Court to stay the federal action until his state proceedings had concluded.  He also presumably could have checked the court records in the prison\xe2\x80\x99s writ room\xe2\x80\x94from which he eventually learned of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, 539 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1337\xe2\x80\x94on a more regular basis.  And he could have sought permission from the state courts to proceed <em>pro se</em> and thus remove Collins from the equation.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  This is not to say the District Court was correct to conclude Holland was not diligent; but the answer is not as obvious as the Court would make it seem.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to intervene when a litigant\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer has made mistakes is understandable; the temptation to tinker with technical rules to achieve what appears a just result is often strong, especially when the client faces a capital sentence.  But the Constitution does not empower federal courts to rewrite, in the name of equity, rules that Congress has made.  Endowing unelected judges with that power is irreconcilable with our system, for it \xe2\x80\x9cwould literally place the whole rights and property of the community under the arbitrary will of the judge,\xe2\x80\x9d arming him with \xe2\x80\x9ca despotic and sovereign authority,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa719, p. 19 (14th ed. 1918).  The danger is doubled when we disregard our own precedent, leaving only our own consciences\nto constrain our discretion.

Moreover, <em>Young </em>stressed that \xc2\xa7507(a)(8)(A)(ii) authorized tolling in instances where equity would <em>not</em> have allowed it, which reinforced the presumption in favor of tolling.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Here, the Court does not suggest that any of \xc2\xa72244(d)\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions go beyond what equity would have allowed.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court dismisses <em>Coleman</em> as \xe2\x80\x9ca case about federalism\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore inapposite here.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I fail to see how federalism concerns are not implicated by ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions to the statute of limitations for attempts to overturn state-court convictions.

App. 1973), to show Collins\xe2\x80\x99s poor performance, App. 149\xe2\x80\x93150, but that did not amount to a request to proceed <em>pro se</em>.  <em>Nelson</em> held that a defendant <em>facing trial</em> who seeks to discharge his court-appointed counsel for ineffectiveness is entitled to a hearing to determine if new counsel is required.  274 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 259.  If the defendant fails to make that showing, but \xe2\x80\x9ccontinues to demand a dismissal of his court appointed counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nelson </em>explained that \xe2\x80\x9ca trial judge may in his discretion discharge counsel and require the defendant to proceed to trial without representation by court appointed counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Hardwick</em> v. <em>State</em>, 521 So.\xc2\xa02d 1071, 1074\xe2\x80\x931075 (Fla. 1988).  There is no reason why requesting that procedure in state habeas proceedings should be construed as a request to proceed <em>pro se.</em>  Holland, unlike a defendant still facing trial, did not need permission to fire Collins, since there was no right to representation to waive.  Once his request for a new attorney was denied, Holland himself could have informed Collins that his services were no longer required.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
