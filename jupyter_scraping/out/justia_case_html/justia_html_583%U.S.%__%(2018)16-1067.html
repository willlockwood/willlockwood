Pursuant to\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2), which provides that in such cases \xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the [prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d the district court ordered Mr. Murphy to pay 10% of his judgment toward the fee award, leaving defendants responsible for the remainder.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) required the district court to exhaust 25% of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s judgment before demanding payment from the defendants.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: In cases governed by \xc2\xa71997e(d), district courts must apply as much of the judgment as necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The specific statutory language supports the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  First, the mandatory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be applied\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to perform.  Second, the infinitival phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded\xe2\x80\x9d specifies the purpose or aim of the preceding verb\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscretionary duty.  Third, \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d an obligation, especially a financial obligation, usually means to discharge the obligation in full.  Together, these three clues suggest that a district court (1) <i>must</i> act (2) with the <i>purpose</i> of (3) <i>fully discharging</i> the fee award.  And the district court must use as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award without exceeding the 25% cap.  Contrary to Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the district court does not have wide discretion to pick any \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d that does not exceed the 25% cap.  The larger statutory scheme supports the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  The previously governing provision, 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b), granted district courts discretion to award fees in unambiguous terms.  It is doubtful that Congress, had it wished to confer the same sort of discretion in \xc2\xa71997e(d), would have bothered to write a new law for prisoner civil rights suits alone; omit all of the words that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old discretionary words with new mandatory ones.  This conclusion is reinforced by \xc2\xa71997e(d)\xe2\x80\x99s surrounding provisions, which like paragraph (2), also limit the district court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing discretion under \xc2\xa71988(b).  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii).  The discretion urged by Mr. Murphy is exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under \xc2\xa71988.  And his suggested cure for rudderless discretion\xe2\x80\x94to have district courts apportion fees in proportion to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability\xe2\x80\x94has no basis in the statutory text or roots in the law.

When a prisoner wins a civil rights suit and the district court awards fees to the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, a federal statute says that \xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the [prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).  Whatever else you might make of this, the first sentence pretty clearly tells us that the prisoner has to pay some part of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award before financial responsibility shifts to the defendant.  But how much is enough?  Does the first sentence allow the district court discretion to take <i>any</i> amount it wishes from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to pay the attorney, from 25% down to a penny?  Or does the first sentence instead mean that the court must pay the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s entire fee award from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment until it reaches the 25% cap and only then turn to the defendant?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The facts of our case illustrate the problem we face.  After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Charles Murphy in the amount of $307,733.82 against two of his prison guards, Officer Robert Smith and Lieutenant Gregory Fulk.  The court also awarded Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s attorney $108,446.54 in fees.  So far, so good.  But then came the question who should pay what portion of the fee award.  The defendants argued that, under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms, the court had to take 25% (or about $77,000) from Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s judgment before taxing them for the balance of the fee award.  The court, however, refused that request.  Instead, it ordered that Mr. Murphy \xe2\x80\x9cshall pay 10% of [his] judgment\xe2\x80\x9d (or about $31,000) toward the fee award, with the defendants responsible for the rest.  In support of this allocation, the district court explained that it commonly varied the amount prisoners pay, though the court offered no explanation for choosing 10% instead of some other number.  On appeal, a unanimous panel reversed, explaining its view that the language of \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) requires a district court to exhaust 25% of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s judgment before demanding payment from the defendants.  844 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 660 (CA7 2016).  So there we have both sides of the debate, and our question, in a nutshell: did the district court have latitude to apply 10% (or some other discretionary amount) of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award instead of 25%?  See 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017) (granting certiorari to resolve this question).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As always, we start with the specific statutory language in dispute.  That language (again) says \xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).  And we think this much tells us a few things.  First, the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d usually creates a mandate, not a liberty, so the verb phrase \xe2\x80\x9cshall be applied\xe2\x80\x9d tells us that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to perform.  See <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26,\n35 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mandatory \xe2\x80\x98shall\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, immediately following the verb we find an infinitival phrase (\xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded\xe2\x80\x9d) that specifies the purpose or aim of the verb\xe2\x80\x99s non-discretionary duty.  Cf. R. Huddleston &amp; G. Pullum, Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, ch. 8, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 12.2, pp. 669, 729\xe2\x80\x93730 (2002).  Third, we know that when you purposefully seek or aim \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Together, then, these three clues suggest that the court (1) <i>must</i> apply judgment funds toward the fee award (2) with the <i>purpose</i> of (3) <i>fully discharging</i> the fee award.  And to meet <i>that</i> duty, a district court must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25% cap.  If Congress had wished to afford the judge more discretion in this area, it could have easily substituted \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cshall.\xe2\x80\x9d  And if Congress had wished to prescribe a different purpose for the judge to pursue, it could have easily replaced the infinitival phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cagainst .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose those other words.  And respect for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s prerogatives as policymaker means carefully attending to the words it chose rather than replacing them with others of our own.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s reply does more to hurt than help his cause.  Consider, he says, college math credits that the college prospectus says shall be \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d a chemistry degree.  No one, the argument goes, would understand that phrase to suggest a single math course will fully discharge all chemistry degree requirements.  We quite agree, but that is beside the point.  In Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s example, as in our statute, the word \xe2\x80\x9csatisfy\xe2\x80\x9d does not suggest some hidden empirical judgment about <i>how often</i> a math class will satisfy a chemistry degree.  Instead it serves to tell the college registrar <i>what purpose</i> he must pursue when handed the student\xe2\x80\x99s transcript: the registrar must, without discretion, apply those credits toward the satisfaction or discharge of the student\xe2\x80\x99s credit obligations.  No doubt a college student needing three credits to graduate who took a three-credit math course would be bewildered to learn the registrar thought he had discretion to count only two of those credits toward her degree.  So too here.  It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how many fee awards will be fully satisfied from a judgment without breaking the 25% cap, or whether any particular fee award could be.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s point is to instruct the judge about the purpose he must pursue\xe2\x80\x94to discharge the fee award using judgment funds to the extent possible, subject to the 25% cap.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Retreating now, Mr. Murphy contends that whatever the verb and the infinitival phrase mean, the subject of the sentence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca <i>portion</i> of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94necessarily suggests wide judicial discretion.  This language, he observes, anticipates a <i>range</i> of amounts (some \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d up to 25%) that can be taken from his judgment.  And the existence of the range, Mr. Murphy contends, necessarily means that the district court must enjoy discretion to pick <i>any</i> \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d so long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exceed the 25% cap. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But that does not logically follow.  Under <i>either</i> side\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute the portion of fees taken from the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment will vary over a range\xe2\x80\x94whether because of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary choice (as Mr. Murphy contends), or because of the variance in the size of fee awards themselves, which sometimes will be less than 25% of the judgment (as Officer Smith and Lieutenant Fulk suggest).  If the police have two suspects in a robbery committed with a red getaway car, the fact that one suspect drives a red sedan proves nothing if the other does too.  The fact that the statute contemplates a range of possible \xe2\x80\x9cportion[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to be paid out of the judgment, thus, just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help identify which of the two proposed interpretations we should adopt for both bear that feature.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does the word \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily denote unfettered discretion.  If someone told you to follow a written recipe but double the portion of sugar, you would know precisely how much sugar to put in\xe2\x80\x94twice whatever\xe2\x80\x99s on the page.  And Congress has certainly used the word \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d in just that way.  Take\n\n16 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7673b, which defines the National Elk Refuge to include the \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ntire portion now in Jackson Hole National Monument except that portion in section 2 lying west of the east right-of-way line of United States Highway Numbered 187,\xe2\x80\x9d among other similar plots\xe2\x80\x94descriptions sufficiently determinate that the statute itself can later give the total number of acres of covered land (\xe2\x80\x9csix thousand three hundred and seventy-six acres, more or less\xe2\x80\x9d).  So the question is how has Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d in this statute?  And as we have explained, the text persuades us that, subject to the 25% cap, the size of the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d here is fixed by reference to the size of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award, not left to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s unguided choice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if the interpretive race in this case seems close at this point, close races still have winners.  Besides, stepping back to take in the larger statutory scheme surrounding the specific language before us reveals that this case isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as close as it might first appear.  In 1976, Congress enacted what is now\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b) to authorize discretionary fee shifting in civil rights suits.  Civil Rights Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Fees Awards Act,\n\n90Stat.\n2641.  For years that statute governed the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in a large variety of civil rights actions, including prisoner civil rights lawsuits like this one.  But in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Congress reentered the field and adopted \xc2\xa71997e\xe2\x80\x99s new and specialized fee shifting rule for prisoner civil rights suits alone.  See\n\n110Stat.\n1321\xe2\x80\x9371.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Comparing the terms of the old and new statutes helps to shed a good deal of light on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 positions.  Section 1988(b) confers discretion on district courts in unambiguous terms: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he court, in its <i>discretion</i>, <i>may</i> allow the prevailing party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a <i>reasonable</i> attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs\xe2\x80\x9d against the defendant. (Emphasis added.)  Meanwhile, \xc2\xa71997e(d) expressly qualifies the usual operation of \xc2\xa71988(b) in prisoner cases.  See \xc2\xa71997e(d)(1) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any action brought by a prisoner .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are authorized under section 1988 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. such fees shall not be awarded, except\xe2\x80\x9d under certain conditions).  And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) proceeds to use very different language to describe the district court\xe2\x80\x99s job in awarding fees.  It does not say \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not say \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d and it certainly does not say anything about \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  If Congress had wished to confer the same discretion in \xc2\xa71997e(d) that it conferred in \xc2\xa71988(b), we very much doubt it would have bothered to write a new law; omit all the words that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old discretionary words with new mandatory ones.  See <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16,\n23 (1983)\n (refusing to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cthe differing language\xe2\x80\x9d in two statutory provisions \xe2\x80\x9chas the same meaning in each\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The surrounding statutory structure of \xc2\xa71997e(d) reinforces this conclusion.  Like paragraph (2), the other provisions of \xc2\xa71997e(d) <i>also </i>limit the district court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing discretion under \xc2\xa71988(b).  These provisions limit the fees that would otherwise be available under \xc2\xa71988 to cover only certain kinds of lawyerly tasks, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii); they require proportionality between fee awards and the relief ordered, see \xc2\xa71997e(d)(1)(B)(i); and they restrict the hourly rate of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, see \xc2\xa71997e(d)(3).  All this suggests a statute that seeks to restrain, rather than replicate, the discretion found in \xc2\xa71988(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Notably, too, the discretion Mr. Murphy would have us introduce into \xc2\xa71997e doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even sit easily with our precedent under \xc2\xa71988. Our cases interpreting \xc2\xa71988 establish \xe2\x80\x9c[a] strong presumption that the lodestar figure\xe2\x80\x94the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate\xe2\x80\x94represents a \xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 546,\n565 (1986)\n.  To be sure, before the lodestar became \xe2\x80\x9cthe guiding light of our fee shifting jurisprudence,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Burlington</i> v. <i>Dague</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557,\n562 (1992)\n, many lower courts used one of your classic 12-factor balancing tests.  See <i>Delaware Valley, </i>478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 562, and n.\xc2\xa07.  Ultimately, though, this Court rejected undue reliance on the 12-factor test because it \xe2\x80\x9cgave very little actual guidance to district courts[,]\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. placed unlimited discretion in trial judges[,] and produced disparate results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 563.  Yet, despite this guidance, Mr. Murphy effectively seeks to (re)introduce into \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice\xe2\x80\x94and the disparate results that come with it\xe2\x80\x94that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under \xc2\xa71988.  And he seeks to achieve all this on the basis of considerably less helpful statutory language.  To state the suggestion is to reveal its defect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s proposed cure solve his problem.  To avoid reading \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) as affording entirely rudderless discretion, Mr. Murphy contends that district courts should apportion fees in proportion to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability.  When a defendant has acted egregiously, he says, the court should lower the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for the fee award and increase the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94even if that means applying only a \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d amount of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment toward the fee.  But precisely none of this appears in \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) or, for that matter, enjoys any analogue in \xc2\xa71988\xe2\x80\x99s lodestar analysis or even the old 12-factor approach.  Whatever you might have to say about Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s culpability formula as a matter of policy, it has no roots in the law.  Nor is it clear, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, that the culpability approach would even help him.  The district court never cited the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 culpability (or any other reason) to justify taking only 10% rather than 25% from Mr. Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to see what the choice of 10% might have had to do with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s culpability in this case.

I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In approaching this case, it helps to understand the background of the fee award at issue.  On July 25, 2011, petitioner Charles Murphy, a prisoner at the Vandalia Correctional Center in Illinois, reported that his assigned seat at mealtime had food and water on it, which resulted in Murphy being handcuffed and escorted to a segregation building.  Once there, Murphy taunted respondent Correctional Officer Robert Smith, who responded by hitting Murphy in the eye and applying a choke hold, causing Murphy to lose consciousness.  When Murphy woke up, Officer Smith and respondent Lieutenant Gregory Fulk were pushing him into a cell.  His hands were still cuffed behind his back and he fell face-first into the cell and hit his head on a metal toilet.  Officer Smith and Lieutenant Fulk then stripped Murphy of his clothes, removed his handcuffs, and left him in the cell without checking his condition.  Thirty or forty minutes passed until a nurse arrived to attend to Murphy, who was sent to a hospital.  Part of his eye socket had been crushed and required surgery.  Despite the procedure, Murphy did not fully recover; almost five years later, his vision remained doubled and blurred.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Murphy sued respondents under\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and state-law causes of action.  After trial, a jury found Officer Smith liable for state-law battery and unconstitutional use of force under the\n \nEighth Amendment, and found Lieutenant Fulk liable for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need in violation of the\n \nEighth Amendment.  The jury awarded Murphy $409,750.00 in compensatory and punitive damages, which the District Court reduced to $307,733.82.  The District Court also awarded Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s attorney $108,446.54 in fees for the several hundred hours he spent on the case and, pursuant to \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2), ordered Murphy to contribute 10 percent of his money judgment toward the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award and respondents to pay the rest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents appealed, arguing that \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) required Murphy to contribute 25 percent of his judgment toward payment of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed and reversed.  In so doing, it acknowledged that its interpretation of \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) was at odds with that of all the other Courts of Appeals to have considered the question.  See 844 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 660 (2016) (citing <i>Boesing</i> v. <i>Spiess</i>, 540 F.\xc2\xa03d 886, 892 (CA8 2008); <i>Parker</i> v. <i>Conway</i>, 581 F.\xc2\xa03d 198, 205 (CA3 2009)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The relevant provision in the PLRA provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever a monetary judgment is awarded in [a civil-rights action brought by a prisoner], a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant.

To meet its duty to act with the purpose of fully discharging the fee award, the majority reasons, \xe2\x80\x9ca district court must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to sat- isfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25% cap.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d as it is used in \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) does not bear the weight the majority places on it.  Its neighboring text and the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation rebut the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d compels a district court always to maximize the amount of the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to be contributed to the fee award, and instead indicate that the only work \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d does in the statute is to direct a district court to contribute some amount of the judgment toward payment of the fee award.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beginning with the neighboring text, it may well be that, standing alone, \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d is often used to mean \xe2\x80\x9cto completely fulfill an obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the statutory provision here does not simply say \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d; it says \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a matter of everyday usage, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d often means \xe2\x80\x9capplied toward the satisfaction of,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9capplied in complete fulfillment of.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, whereas an action undertaken \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d an obligation might, as the majority suggests, naturally be understood as an effort to discharge the obligation in full, <i>ante,</i> at 3, a contribution that is \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d an obligation need not be intended to discharge the obligation in full.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Take a few examples: A consumer makes a payment on her credit card, which her agreement with the card company provides shall be \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d her debt.  A student enrolls in a particular type of math class, the credits from which her university registrar earlier announced shall be \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d the requirements of a physics degree.  And a law firm associate contributes hours to a <i>pro\xc2\xa0bono</i> matter that her firm has provided may be \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d the firm\xe2\x80\x99s overall billable-hours requirement.  In each case, pursuant to the relevant agreement, the payment, credits, and hours are applied toward the satisfaction of a larger obligation, but the inference is not that the consumer, student, or associate had to contribute or even necessarily did contribute the maximum possible credit card payment, classroom credits, or hours toward the fulfillment of those obligations.  The consumer may have chosen to make the minimum credit card payment because she preferred to allocate her other funds elsewhere; the student may have chosen the four-credit version of the math course over the six-credit one because the former had a better instructor; and the associate may have been judicious about the hours she dedicated to the <i>pro\xc2\xa0bono</i> matter because she knew her firm more highly valued paid over <i>pro\xc2\xa0bono</i> work.  So, too, here.  Section 1997e(d)(2), like the credit card agreement, university registrar announcement, and law firm policy, sets out the relevant rule\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d the fee award\xe2\x80\x94and the district court, like the consumer, student, and law firm associate, decides how much of the judgment to apply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a practical matter, moreover, a district court will almost never be able to discharge fully a fee award from 25 percent of a prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  In the vast majority of prisoner-civil-rights cases, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award exceeds the monetary judgment awarded to the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff.  In fiscal year 2012, for instance, the median damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action litigated to victory (<i>i.e.,</i> not settled or decided against the prisoner) was a mere $4,185.  See Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Enters Adulthood, 5 U. C. Irvine L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 153, 168 (2015) (Table 7) (Trends in Prisoner Litigation).  Therefore, in 2012, the maximum amount (25 percent) of the median judgment that could be applied toward an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award was $1,046.25.  The PLRA caps the hourly rate that may be awarded to a prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney at 150 percent of the rate for court-appointed counsel under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A, which in 2012 was $125.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71997e(d)(3); App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.<b> </b>Thus, a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s attorney was entitled to up to $187.50 per hour worked.  Even if a district court were to apply an hourly rate of just $100, well below the cap, unless the attorney put in fewer than 10.5 hours in the ordinary case\xe2\x80\x94a virtually unimaginable scenario\xe2\x80\x9425 percent of the judgment will not come close to discharging fully the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Such low judgments are not a new phenomenon in prisoner-civil-rights suits; they were the norm even before Congress enacted the PLRA.  In fiscal year 1993, for example, the median damages award for prisoner-plaintiffs in cases won at trial was $1,000.  See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 167; Schlanger, Inmate Litigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1602\xe2\x80\x931603, and Table II.C (2003).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the very small judgment awards in successfully litigated prisoner-civil-rights cases, it is hard to believe, as the majority contends, that Congress used \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d to command an effort by district courts to \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in full,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 3, when in most cases, full discharge will never be possible.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Rather, taking into account both the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation and the most natural reading of \xe2\x80\x9capplied to satisfy,\xe2\x80\x9d the more logical inference is that \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) simply requires that a portion of the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment be applied toward the satisfaction of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  It does not, however, demand that the district court always order the prisoner-plaintiff to pay the maximum possible portion of the judgment (up to 25 percent) needed to discharge fully the fee award.  Under that interpretation, applying any amount of Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s judgment toward payment of his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award complies with \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2), whether that amount is 10 percent of the judgment as ordered by the District Court or 25 percent as ordered by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority suggests that if Congress had wanted to permit judges to pursue something other than full discharge of the fee award from the judgment, it could have replaced \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cto reduce\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cagainst.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 3.  But the majority ignores that Congress also easily could have written \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) to more clearly express the meaning it and respondents champion.  The statute, for example, simply could have said: \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five percent of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, Congress considered and rejected language prior to enacting the current attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee apportionment provision that would have done just what the majority claims.  An earlier version of \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) provided:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant.  <i>If the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment</i>, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa73(d), p. 16 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The italicized clause plainly expressed what the major- ity contends the current provision means, <i>i.e.</i>, that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability for the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award begins only if any portion of the award remains unpaid after the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff has contributed 25 percent of the judgment.  But Congress removed this clause before finalizing the bill, thus electing to keep the 25-percent ceiling for the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the fee award and rejecting a 25-percent floor for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contribution.  See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93378, p. 71 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority alternatively disclaims the ability to discern what motivated the deletion and pronounces that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t shows that, at some stage of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, its proponents likely shared [the majority\xe2\x80\x99s] understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of how the first sentence works.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa02.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, it is more likely that Congress drafted two redundant sentences than two conflicting ones.  <i>Ibid.</i>  That supposition, however, is purely speculative.  Here is what is known for certain: Congress had before it language that would have accomplished exactly the statutory function the majority today endorses and Congress chose to excise that language from the text.  Our precedent instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here Congress includes limiting language in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was not intended.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16\n\xe2\x80\x9324 (1983).

Specifically, that grant of discretion is evident from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of two discretion-conferring terms, \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first word, \xe2\x80\x9cportion,\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] share or allotted part (as of an estate).\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1182 (7th ed. 1999).  \xe2\x80\x9cPortion\xe2\x80\x9d thus inherently conveys an indeterminate amount.  Take, for instance, the following sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dinner guest has requested a portion of apple pie for dessert.\xe2\x80\x9d  How much is a \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d of pie?  For a marathon runner, a \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d might mean a hearty serving, perhaps an eighth of a whole pie; for someone on a diet, however, a \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d might mean a tiny sliver.  The dinner host can figure it out based on the circumstances.  Similarly, in this context, referencing a \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d of the judgment tells us that some<i> </i>amount of the judgment up to 25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award, but not exactly what amount.  That decision is left to the sound discretion of the district court, depending again on the circumstances.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority dismisses as insignificant Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of this discretion-conferring term, arguing that under either side\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute, the \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d of fees taken from the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment will vary.  See <i>ante,</i> at 5.  True enough,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>] but that fact does not justify the majority\xe2\x80\x99s brushoff.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 deliberate choice to use the indeterminate, discretion-conferring term \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) reveals much about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To illustrate the significance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cportion,\xe2\x80\x9d imagine that \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) contained no qualifying \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d parenthetical, and instead provided only that \xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees awarded against the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  As applied to the typical scenario, <i>i.e.,</i> where the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award exceeds the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s money judgment, the most natural reading of the statute absent the limiting parenthetical is that the amount of the judgment applied to the fee award must be more than zero and less than 100 percent.  That is because, as explained above, \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d means something less than the whole but does not have a fixed value.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  If the majority were correct in its reading of \xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy,\xe2\x80\x9d how- ever\xe2\x80\x94that it requires the district court to endeavor to discharge fully the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award from the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s judgment before turning to the defendant for a contribution\xe2\x80\x94then, in the typical case, absent the parenthetical, we would have to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9ca portion of the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d always means \xe2\x80\x9call of the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d or perhaps \xe2\x80\x9call of the judgment save a nominal amount.\xe2\x80\x9d  I do not think it reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to ascribe such a strained meaning to \xe2\x80\x9cportion.\xe2\x80\x9d  That the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of one term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto satisfy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94forces an implausible reading of another term\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94strongly suggests that its reading is incorrect.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cportion,\xe2\x80\x9d therefore, does not merely instruct that there are a range of possible portions that can be paid out of the judgment.  \xe2\x80\x9cPortion\xe2\x80\x9d makes evident that the district court is afforded the discretion to choose the amount of the judgment to be paid toward the fee award.  The addition of the \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed 25 percent\xe2\x80\x9d parenthetical only enhances this conclusion.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed,\xe2\x80\x9d which is itself discretion conferring, sets an upper, but not a lower, limit and thus cabins, but does not eliminate, the exercise of discretion that \xe2\x80\x9cportion\xe2\x80\x9d confers.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The distinction between cabining and eliminating discretion is also key to understanding the relationship between \xc2\xa71997e(d) and\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b), as well as between \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1988(b), the Civil Rights Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Fees Awards Act of 1976, authorizes a district court to award \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee\xe2\x80\x9d to a prevailing party in an action to enforce one or more of several federal civil rights laws.  Section 1997e(d) in turn imposes limits on the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees available under \xc2\xa71988(b) when the prevailing plaintiff in one of the specified civil-rights actions is a prisoner.  In particular, the district court may award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the prisoner only if \xe2\x80\x9cthe fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section 1988,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71997e(d)(1).  In addition, as noted <i>supra,</i> at 5, the district court may not base an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9con an hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly rate established under [\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A] for payment of court-appointed counsel\xe2\x80\x9d and, if the prisoner-plaintiff was awarded damages, may not award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in excess of 150 percent of the monetary judgment.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71997e(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(3).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These provisions, of course, do not eliminate a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion when it comes to the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff; they merely compress the range of permissible options.  A district court still has the discretion to decide whether to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, just as it ordinarily would under \xc2\xa71988(b); it simply must first ensure that the threshold conditions set out in \xc2\xa71997e(d)(1) are satisfied.  A district court likewise still has the discretion to determine what constitutes a reasonable amount of fees to award; it simply must abide by the two 150-percent caps in doing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just as these surrounding statutory provisions in \xc2\xa71997e(d) set outward bounds on a district court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion while still preserving the exercise of discretion within those bounds, so, too, does \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).  A district court is not free to require the defendant to pay the entire attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award, nor is it free to require the prisoner-plaintiff to give up more than 25 percent of his judgment to pay the fee award.  But within those boundaries, the district court is free to decide which party should pay what portion of the fee award.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority suggests that affording discretion to district courts when it comes to the apportionment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee awards is in tension with our adoption of the lodestar method as the presumptive means of calculating a reasonable fee award under \xc2\xa71988.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  Prior to the lodestar\xe2\x80\x99s development, several lower courts utilized 12 \xe2\x80\x9csometimes subjective factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Delaware Valley Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Council for Clean Air</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 546,\n563 (1986)\n.  Because that method \xe2\x80\x9cplaced unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, this Court endorsed the lodestar approach, pursuant to which a court multiplies \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Blum</i> v. <i>Stenson</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 886,\n888 (1984)\n, and then considers whether to make adjustments to that amount, see <i>id., </i>at 898\xe2\x80\x93901; <i>Hensley</i> v. <i>Eckerhart</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424,\n435 (1983)\n.  The majority asserts that adopting Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cexactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice\xe2\x80\x9d this Court sought to leave behind when it sanctioned the lodestar approach.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  That analogy, however, is inapt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the question before us is whether \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) affords district courts any<i> </i>discretion in the apportionment of responsibility for payment of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award, not how district courts reasonably should exercise that discretion.  When this Court embraced the lodestar approach, it did so to provide guideposts to district courts as they exercised the discretion granted to them by \xc2\xa71988(b) to \xe2\x80\x9callow the prevailing party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  By no means did this Court eliminate that exercise of discretion.  Rather, the Court has \xe2\x80\x9creemphasize[d] that the district court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee award.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hensley</i>, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 437; see also <i>Blum</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 902, n.\xc2\xa019 (\xe2\x80\x9cA district court is expressly empowered to exercise discretion in determining whether an award is to be made and if so its reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 896 (explaining that the proper standard of review of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award is abuse of discretion).  As was the case for the District Court here, that exercise of discretion can include, for example, whether a defendant is entitled to a reduction in hours where a plaintiff did not succeed on all his claims, and whether certain claimed expenses are reasonable.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a\xe2\x80\x9326a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the majority is concerned that district courts are exercising the apportionment discretion afforded to them by \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) in an uneven or unguided manner, the solution is not to read the conferral of discretion out of the statute entirely.  Instead, as occurred in the \xc2\xa71988(b) context, the Court could endorse a method for apportioning attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee awards that can consistently be applied across cases.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  Just as courts ultimately were capable, through trial-and-error, of discerning an appropriate formula for assessing the reasonableness of a given fee award, see <i>Delaware Valley</i>, 478 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 562\xe2\x80\x93565, so, too, are they capable of determining a sound approach to the apportionment decision envisioned by \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, even absent an equivalent method to the lodestar inquiry, \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) does not, unlike the old 12-factor analysis for calculating fee awards, afford unlimited discretion.  Congress provided express bounds on a district court\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment discretion, requiring that it order the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff to contribute at least some part of his money judgment to the fee award but no more than 25 percent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, it is not obvious that the need for a more regimented approach with respect to calculating the amount of an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award under \xc2\xa71988(b) should dictate the need for a similarly regimented approach with respect to the apportionment of responsibility for that award under \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).  The two decisions involve fundamentally different inquiries: The first is focused on the prevailing-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attorney and is concerned with determining a reasonable value for services rendered in pursuing the action, and the second is focused on the parties and is concerned with assessing the extent to which each party should bear responsibility for payment of those services (within the bounds set by Congress).  In light of these distinctions, the Court should hesitate to extrapolate wholesale from the considerations that drove the adoption of the lodestar rule to constrain the apportionment discretion afforded by \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On my reading of the plain text of \xc2\xa71997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory provisions and context, the proper interpretation of the provision is clear: District courts may exercise discretion in choosing the portion of the prisoner-plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s monetary judgment that must go toward the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee award, so long as that choice is not greater than 25 percent of the judgment.  Because the majority holds that a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff must always yield 25 percent of his monetary judgment or, if less, the full amount of the fee award in every case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0A similar conclusion obtains if one considers the average, rather than the median, damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action litigated to victory, which in 2012 was $20,815.
