She was found to be smuggling 88 cocaine-filled balloons in her alimentary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 473 U. S. 533</a></p><p> canal, and was convicted after a bench trial of various federal narcotics offenses.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed her convictions, holding that her detention violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the customs inspectors did not have a "clear indication" of alimentary canal smuggling at the time she was detained.  731 F.2d 1369 (1984).  Because of a conflict in the decisions of the Courts of Appeals on this question and the importance of its resolution to the enforcement of customs laws, we granted certiorari.  469 U.S. 1188.  We now reverse.</p>\n<p>Respondent arrived at Los Angeles International Airport shortly after midnight, March 5, 1983, on Avianca Flight 080, a direct 10-hour flight from Bogota, Colombia.  Her visa was in order, so she was passed through Immigration and proceeded to the customs desk.  At the customs desk, she encountered Customs Inspector Talamantes, who reviewed her documents and noticed from her passport that she had made at least eight recent trips to either Miami or Los Angeles.  Talamantes referred respondent to a secondary customs desk for further questioning.  At this desk, Talamantes and another inspector asked respondent general questions concerning herself and the purpose of her trip.  Respondent revealed that she spoke no English and had no family or friends in the United States.  She explained in Spanish that she had come to the United States to purchase goods for her husband\'s store in Bogota.  The customs inspectors recognized Bogota as a "source city" for narcotics.  Respondent possessed $5,000 in cash, mostly $50 bills, but had no billfold.  She indicated to the inspectors that she had no appointments with merchandise vendors, but planned to ride around Los Angeles in taxicabs visiting retail stores such as J. C. Penney and K-Mart in order to buy goods for her husband\'s store with the $5,000.</p>\n<p>Respondent admitted that she had no hotel reservations, but stated that she planned to stay at a Holiday Inn.  Respondent could not recall how her airline ticket was purchased. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 473 U. S. 534</a></p><p>  When the inspectors opened respondent\'s one small valise, they found about four changes of "cold weather" clothing.  Respondent had no shoes other than the high-heeled pair she was wearing.  Although respondent possessed no checks, waybills, credit cards, or letters of credit, she did produce a Colombian business card and a number of old receipts, waybills, and fabric swatches displayed in a photo album.</p>\n<p>At this point, Talamantes and the other inspector suspected that respondent was a "balloon swallower," one who attempts to smuggle narcotics into this country hidden in her alimentary canal.  Over the years, Inspector Talamantes had apprehended dozens of alimentary canal smugglers arriving on Avianca Flight 080.  <em>See</em> App. 42; <em>United States v. Mendez-Jimenez,</em> 709 F.2d 1300, 1301 (CA9 1983).</p>\n<p>The inspectors requested a female customs inspector to take respondent to a private area and conduct a patdown and strip search.  During the search, the female inspector felt respondent\'s abdomen area and noticed a firm fullness, as if respondent were wearing a girdle.  The search revealed no contraband, but the inspector noticed that respondent was wearing two pairs of elastic underpants with a paper towel lining the crotch area.</p>\n<p>When respondent returned to the customs area and the female inspector reported her discoveries, the inspector in charge told respondent that he suspected she was smuggling drugs in her alimentary canal.  Respondent agreed to the inspector\'s request that she be x-rayed at a hospital, but in answer to the inspector\'s query, stated that she was pregnant.  She agreed to a pregnancy test before the x-ray.  Respondent withdrew the consent for an x-ray when she learned that she would have to be handcuffed en route to the hospital.  The inspector then gave respondent the option of returning to Colombia on the next available flight, agreeing to an x-ray, or remaining in detention until she produced a monitored bowel movement that would confirm or rebut the inspectors\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 473 U. S. 535</a></p><p> suspicions.  Respondent chose the first option, and was placed in a customs office under observation.  She was told that, if she went to the toilet she would have to use a wastebasket in the women\'s restroom in order that female customs inspectors could inspect her stool for balloons or capsules carrying narcotics.  The inspectors refused respondent\'s request to place a telephone call.</p>\n<p>Respondent sat in the customs office, under observation, for the remainder of the night.  During the night, customs officials attempted to place respondent on a Mexican airline that was flying to Bogota via Mexico City in the morning.  The airline refused to transport respondent because she lacked a Mexican visa necessary to land in Mexico City.  Respondent was not permitted to leave, and was informed that she would be detained until she agreed to an x-ray or her bowels moved.  She remained detained in the customs office under observation, for most of the time curled up in a chair leaning to one side.  She refused all offers of food and drink, and refused to use the toilet facilities.  The Court of Appeals noted that she exhibited symptoms of discomfort consistent with "heroic efforts to resist the usual calls of nature."  731 F.2d at 1371.</p>\n<p>At the shift change at 4:00 o\'clock the next afternoon, almost 16 hours after her flight had landed, respondent still had not defecated or urinated or partaken of food or drink.  At that time, customs officials sought a court order authorizing a pregnancy test, an x-ray, and a rectal examination.  The Federal Magistrate issued an order just before midnight that evening, which authorized a rectal examination and involuntary x-ray, provided that the physician in charge considered respondent\'s claim of pregnancy.  Respondent was taken to a hospital and given a pregnancy test, which later turned out to be negative.  Before the results of the pregnancy test were known, a physician conducted a rectal examination and removed from respondent\'s rectum a balloon containing a foreign substance.  Respondent was then placed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 473 U. S. 536</a></p><p> formally under arrest.  By 4:10 a.m. respondent had passed 6 similar balloons; over the next four days, she passed 88 balloons containing a total of 528 grams of 80% pure cocaine hydrochloride.</p>\n<p>After a suppression hearing, the District Court admitted the cocaine in evidence against respondent.  She was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(a)(1), and unlawful importation of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 952(a), 960(a).</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed respondent\'s convictions.  The court noted that customs inspectors had a "justifiably high level of official skepticism" about respondent\'s good motives, but the inspectors decided to let nature take its course rather than seek an immediate magistrate\'s warrant for an x-ray.  731 F.2d at 1372.  Such a magistrate\'s warrant required a "clear indication" or "plain suggestion" that the traveler was an alimentary canal smuggler under previous decisions of the Court of Appeals.  <em>See United States v. Quintero-Castro,</em> 705 F.2d 1099 (CA9 1983); <em>United States v. Mendez-Jimenez,</em> 709 F.2d 1300, 1302 (CA9 1983); <em>but cf. South Dakota v. Opperman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html">428 U. S. 364</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/364/case.html#370">428 U. S. 370</a></span>, n. 5 (1976).  The court applied this required level of suspicion to respondent\'s case.  The court questioned the "humanity" of the inspectors\' decision to hold respondent until her bowels moved, knowing that she would suffer "many hours of humiliating discomfort" if she chose not to submit to the x-ray examination.  The court concluded that, under a "clear indication" standard,</p>\n<p>"the evidence available to the customs officers when they decided to hold [respondent] for continued observation was insufficient to support the 16-hour detention."</p>\n<p>731 F.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p>The Government contends that the customs inspectors reasonably suspected that respondent was an alimentary canal smuggler, and this suspicion was sufficient to justify the detention.  In support of the judgment below, respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 473 U. S. 537</a></p><p> argues, <em>inter alia,</em> that reasonable suspicion would not support respondent\'s detention, and in any event the inspectors did not reasonably suspect that respondent was carrying narcotics internally.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment commands that searches and seizures be reasonable.  What is reasonable depends upon all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself.  <em>New Jersey v. T. L. O.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/case.html">469 U. S. 325</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/325/case.html#337">469 U. S. 337</a></span>-342 (1985).  The permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by "balancing its intrusion on the individual\'s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests."  <em>United States v. Villamonte-Marquez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/579/case.html">462 U. S. 579</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/579/case.html#588">462 U. S. 588</a></span> (1983); <em>Delaware v.

Since the founding of our Republic, Congress has granted the Executive plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country.  <em>See United States v. Ramsey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/606/case.html">431 U.

This Court has long recognized Congress\' power to police entrants at the border.  <em>See Boyd v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html">116 U.

As we stated recently:</p>\n<p>"\'Import restrictions and searches of persons or packages at the national border rest on different considerations and different rules of constitutional law from domestic regulations.  The Constitution gives Congress broad comprehensive powers \'[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,\' Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 3.

Routine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or warrant, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and first-class mail may be opened without a warrant on less than probable cause, <em>Ramsey, supra.</em>  Automotive travelers may be stopped at fixed checkpoints near the border without individualized suspicion, even if the stop is based largely on ethnicity, <em>United States v.

Villamonte-Marquez, supra.</em></p>\n<p>These cases reflect longstanding concern for the protection of the integrity of the border.  This concern is, if anything, heightened by the veritable national crisis in law enforcement caused by smuggling of illicit narcotics, <em>see United States v.

This desperate practice appears to be a relatively recent addition to the smugglers\' repertoire of deceptive practices, and it also appears to be exceedingly difficult </p><p><a class="page-number" name="539">Page 473 U.

Having presented herself at the border for admission, and having subjected herself to the criminal enforcement powers of the Federal Government, 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 482, respondent was entitled to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.

Quintero-Castro,</em> 705 F.2d 1099 (CA9 1983); <em>cf. United States v. Mendez-Jimenez,</em> 709 F.2d 1300 (CA9 1983).  This "clear indication" language comes from our opinion in <em>Schmerber v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html">384 U. S. 757</a></span> (1966), but we think that the Court of Appeals misapprehended the significance of that phrase in the context in which it was used in <em>Schmerber.</em> [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Court of Appeals viewed "clear indication" as an intermediate standard between "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause."  <em>See Mendez-Jimenez, supra,</em> at 1302.  But we think that the words in <em>Schmerber</em> were used to indicate the necessity for particularized suspicion that the evidence sought might be found within the body of the individual, rather than as enunciating still a third Fourth Amendment threshold between "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause."</p>\n<p>No other court, including this one, has ever adopted <em>Schmerber\'s</em> "clear indication" language as a Fourth Amendment standard.  <em>See, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/753/case.html">470 U.

Indeed, another Court of Appeals, faced with facts almost identical to this case, has adopted a less strict standard based upon reasonable suspicion.  <em>See United States v. Mosquera-Ramirez,</em> 729 F.2d 1352, 1355 (CA11 1984).  We do not think that the Fourth Amendment\'s emphasis upon reasonableness is consistent with the creation of a third verbal standard in addition to "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause"; we are dealing with a constitutional requirement of reasonableness, not <em>mens rea, see United States v. Baley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/394/case.html">444 U. S. 394</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/394/case.html#403">444 U.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The "reasonable suspicion" standard has been applied in a number of contexts, and effects a needed balance between private and public interests when law enforcement officials must make a limited intrusion on less than probable cause.  It thus fits well into the situations involving alimentary canal smuggling at the border:  this type of smuggling gives no external signs, and inspectors will rarely possess probable cause to arrest or search, yet governmental interests in stopping smuggling at the border are high indeed.  Under this standard, officials at the border must have a "particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person" of alimentary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="542">Page 473 U.

It presents few, if any, external signs; a quick frisk will not do, nor will even a strip search.  In the case of respondent, the inspectors had available, as an alternative to simply awaiting her bowel movement, an x-ray.  They offered her the alternative of submitting herself to that procedure.  But when she refused that alternative, the customs inspectors were left with only two practical alternatives:  detain her for such time as necessary to confirm their suspicions, a detention which would last much longer than the typical <em>Terry</em> stop, or turn her loose into the interior carrying the reasonably suspected contraband drugs.</p>\n<p>The inspectors in this case followed this former procedure. They no doubt expected that respondent, having recently disembarked from a 10-hour direct flight with a full and stiff abdomen, would produce a bowel movement without extended delay.  But her visible efforts to resist the call of nature, which the court below labeled "heroic," disappointed this expectation, and in turn caused her humiliation and discomfort.  Our prior cases have refused to charge police with delays in investigatory detention attributable to the suspect\'s evasive actions, <em>see Sharpe,</em> 470 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/675/case.html#687">470 U.

Respondent alone was responsible for much of the duration and discomfort of the seizure. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 473 U. S. 544</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude that the detention in this case was not unreasonably long.  It occurred at the international border, where the Fourth Amendment balance of interests leans heavily to the Government.  At the border, customs officials have more than merely an investigative law enforcement role.  They are also charged, along with immigration officials, with protecting this Nation from entrants who may bring anything harmful into this country, whether that be communicable diseases, narcotics, or explosives.  <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1182(a)(23), 1182(a)(6), 1222; 19 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 162.4-162.7 (1984).  <em>See also</em> 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 482; 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1103(a).  In this regard, the detention of a suspected alimentary canal smuggler at the border is analogous to the detention of a suspected tuberculosis carrier at the border:  both are detained until their bodily processes dispel the suspicion that they will introduce a harmful agent into this country.  <em>Cf.</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1222; 42 CFR pt. 34 (1984); 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 482, 1582.</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s detention was long, uncomfortable, indeed, humiliating; but both its length and its discomfort resulted solely from the method by which she chose to smuggle illicit drugs into this country.  In <em>Adams v. Williams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/case.html">407 U. S. 143</a></span> (1972), another <em>Terry</em>-stop case, we said that</p>\n<p>"[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/143/case.html#145">407 U.

Here, by analogy, in the presence of articulable suspicion of smuggling in her alimentary canal, the customs officers were not required by the Fourth Amendment to pass respondent and her 88 cocaine-filled balloons into the interior.  Her detention for the period of time necessary to either verify or dispel the suspicion was not unreasonable.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Shortly after midnight on March 5, 1983, the respondent Rosa Elvira Montoya de Hernandez was detained by customs officers because she fit the profile of an "alimentary canal smuggler." [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  This profile did not, of course, give the officers probable cause to believe that De Hernandez </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 473 U. S. 546</a></p><p> was smuggling drugs into the country, but, at most, a "reasonable suspicion" that she might be engaged in such an attempt.  After a thorough strip search failed to uncover any contraband, De Hernandez agreed to go to a local hospital for an abdominal x-ray to resolve the matter.  When the officers approached with handcuffs at the ready to lead her away, however, "she crossed her arms by her chest and began stepping backwards shaking her head negatively," protesting:  "You are not going to put those on me.  That is an insult to my character." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Stymied in their efforts, the officers decided on an alternative course:  they would simply lock De Hernandez away in an adjacent manifest room "until her peristaltic functions produced a monitored bowel movement." [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The officers explained to De Hernandez that she could not leave until she had excreted by squatting over a wastebasket pursuant to the watchful eyes of two attending matrons.  De Hernandez responded:  "I will not submit to your degradation, and I\'d rather die." [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  She was locked away with the matrons.</p>\n<p>De Hernandez remained locked up in the room for almost <em>24 hours.</em>  Three shifts of matrons came and went during this time.  The room had no bed or couch on which she could lie, but only hard chairs and a table.  The matrons told her that, if she wished to sleep, she could lie down on the hard, uncarpeted floor.  De Hernandez instead "sat in her chair clutching her purse," "occasionally putting her head down on the table to nap." [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Most of the time, she simply wept and pleaded "to go home." [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  She repeatedly begged for permission "to call my husband and tell him what you are doing to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 473 U. S. 547</a></p><p> me." [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Permission was denied.  Sobbing, she insisted that she had to "make a phone call home so that she could talk to her children and to let them know that everything was all right." [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Permission again was denied.  In fact, the matrons considered it highly "unusual" that "each time someone entered the search room, she would take out two small pictures of her children and show them to the person." [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  De Hernandez also demanded that her attorney be contacted. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Once again, permission was denied.  As far as the outside world knew, Rosa de Hernandez had simply vanished.  And although she already had been stripped and searched and probed, the customs officers decided about halfway through her ordeal to repeat that process -- "to ensure the safety of the surveilling officers.  The result was again negative." [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>After almost 24 hours had passed, someone finally had the presence of mind to consult a Magistrate and to obtain a court order for an x-ray and a body cavity search. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  DeHernandez, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 473 U. S. 548</a></p><p> "very agitated," was handcuffed and led away to the hospital. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  A rectal examination disclosed the presence of a cocaine-filled balloon.  At approximately 3:15 on the morning of March 6, <em>almost 27 hours after her initial detention,</em> De Hernandez was formally placed under arrest and advised of her <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Over the course of the next four days, she excreted a total of 88 balloons.</p>\n<p>"[T]hat the [respondent] so degraded herself as to offend the sensibilities of any decent citizen is not questioned."

Applying this "reasonableness" test to the instant case, the Court concludes that the "[r]espondent alone was responsible for much of the duration and discomfort of the seizure."  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS takes a somewhat different tack.  Apparently convinced that the health effects of x-irradiation on human beings stand established as so minimal as to be little cause for concern, he believes that low-ranking customs officials, on their own initiative, may require nonpregnant international travelers to submit to warrantless x-rays on nothing more than suspicion if such travelers wish to avoid indeterminate warrantless detentions.  Because De Hernandez withdrew her consent to proceed in handcuffs to such an examination, "[t]he prolonged detention of respondent was . . . justified."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#545">473 U.

Indefinite involuntary incommunicado detentions "for investigation" are the hallmark of a police state, not a free society.  <em>See, e.g., Dunaway v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/case.html">442 U. S. 200</a></span> (1979); <em>Brown v.

In my opinion, Government officials may no more confine a person at the border under such circumstances for purposes of criminal investigation than they may within the interior of the country.  The nature and duration of the detention here may well have been tolerable for spoiled meat or diseased animals, but not for human beings held on simple suspicion of criminal activity.  I believe such indefinite detentions can be "reasonable" under the Fourth Amendment only with the approval of a magistrate.  I also believe that such approval can be given only upon a showing of probable cause.  Finally, I believe that the warrant and probable cause safeguards equally govern JUSTICE STEVENS\' proffered alternative of exposure to x-irradiation for criminal investigative purposes. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 473 U.

For example, the length and nature of a detention may, at least when conducted for criminal investigative purposes, ripen into something approximating a full-scale custodial arrest -- indeed, the arrestee, unlike the detainee in cases such as this, is at least given such basic rights as a telephone call, <em>Miranda</em> warnings, a bed, a prompt hearing before the nearest federal magistrate, an appointed attorney, and consideration of bail.

The conditions of De Hernandez\' detention in this case -- indefinite confinement in a squalid back room cut off from the outside world, the absence of basic amenities that would have been provided to even the vilest of hardened criminals, repeated strip searches -- in many ways surpassed the conditions of a full custodial arrest.  Although the Court previously has declined to require a warrant for border searches involving "minor interference with privacy resulting from the mere stop for questioning," <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html#565">428 U.

One physician who at the request of customs officials conducted many "internal searches" -- rectal and vaginal examinations and stomach pumping -- estimated that he had found contraband in only 15 to 20 percent of the persons he had examined. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]  It has similarly been estimated that only 16 percent of women subjected to body cavity searches at the border were in fact found to be carrying contraband. [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]  It is precisely to minimize the risk of harassing so many innocent people that the Fourth Amendment requires the intervention of a judicial officer.  <em>See, e.g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/443/case.html#481">403 U. S. 481</a></span>.  And even if the warrant safeguard were somehow a mere inconvenient nuisance to be "<em>weighed\' against the claims of police efficiency," <em>ibid.,</em> the Government points to no unusual efficiency concerns suggesting that this safeguard should be overridden in the run of such intrusive border search cases.  Certainly there were no "exigent circumstances" supporting the indefinite warrantless detention here, and the Government\'s interest in proceeding expeditiously could have been achieved by obtaining a telephonic </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 473 U.

I have previously set forth my views on the proper scope and duration of Terry stops, [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>] and need not repeat those views in detail today.  It is enough for present purposes to note that today\'s opinion is the most extraordinary example to date of the Court\'s studied effort to employ the <em>Terry</em> decision as a means of converting the Fourth Amendment into a general "reasonableness" balancing process -- a process "in which the judicial thumb apparently will be planted firmly on the law enforcement side of the scales."  <em>United States v.

We previously have emphasized that <em>Terry</em> allows the authorities <em>briefly</em> to detain an individual for investigation and questioning, but that "any <em>further detention</em> or search must be based on consent or probable cause."  <em>United States v.

Allowing such warrantless detentions under <em>Terry</em> suggests that the authorities might hold a person on suspicion for "however long it takes" to get him to cooperate, or to transport him to the station where the "legitimate" state interests more fully can be pursued, or simply to lock him away while deciding what the State\'s "legitimate" interests require.  But the Fourth Amendment flatly prohibits such "wholesale intrusions upon the personal security" of individuals, and any application of <em>Terry,</em> even by analogy, to permit such indefinite detentions "would threaten to swallow" the basic probable cause and warrant safeguards.  <em>Dunaway v.

Neither the law of the land nor the law of nature supports the notion that petty government officials can require people to excrete on command; indeed, the Court relies elsewhere on "[t]he rudimentary knowledge of the human body" in sanctioning the "much longer than . . . typical" duration of detentions such as this.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#543">473 U.

[<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court further appears to believe that such investigative practices are "reasonable," however, on the premise that a traveler\'s "expectation of privacy [is] less at the border than in the interior."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#539">473 U.

This may well be so with respect to routine border inspections, but I do not imagine that decent and law-abiding international travelers have yet reached the point where they "expect" to be thrown into locked rooms and ordered to excrete into wastebaskets, held incommunicado until they cooperate, or led away in handcuffs to the nearest hospital for exposure to various medical procedures -- all on nothing more than the "reasonable" suspicions of low-ranking enforcement agents.  In fact, many people from around the world travel to our borders precisely to escape such unchecked executive investigatory discretion.  What a curious first lesson in American liberty awaits them </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 473 U. S. 561</a></p><p> on their arrival.  <em>Cf. Olmstead v.

[<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, I disagree with JUSTICE STEVENS that De Hernandez\' alternative "choice" of submitting to abdominal x-irradiation at the discretion of customs officials made this detention "justified."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#545">473 U. S. 545</a></span> (concurring in judgment).  Medical x-rays are of course a common diagnostic technique; that is exactly why there is such a sharp debate among the medical community concerning the cellular and chromosomal effects of routine reliance on x-rays, both from the perspective of individual health (it having been estimated that a routine medical x-ray takes about six days off a person\'s life expectancy [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]) and from the perspective of successive generations.  The "additivity" factor -- the cumulative effect of x-rays on an individual\'s biological and genetic wellbeing -- has been the subject of particularly disturbing debate. [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 473 U. S. 562</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But these dangers are not the gravamen of my dispute with JUSTICE STEVENS; the Court has concluded that medical practices far more immediately intrusive than this may, in carefully limited circumstances, be employed as a tool of criminal investigation.  <em>Cf. Winston v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/753/case.html">470 U. S. 753</a></span> (1985).  Rather, the crux of my disagreement is this:  we have learned in our lifetimes, time and again, the inherent dangers that result from coupling unchecked "law enforcement" discretion with the tools of medical technology.  Accordingly, in this country at least,</p>\n<p>"[t]he importance of informed, detached and deliberate [judicial] determinations of the issue whether or not to invade another\'s body in search of evidence of guilt is indisputable and great."</p>\n<p><em>Schmerber v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html">384 U.

Because</p>\n<p>"[s]earch warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings, . . . <em>absent an emergency,</em> no less could be required where intrusions into the human body are concerned."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  This should be so whether the intrusion is by incision, by stomach pumping, or by exposure to x-irradiation.  Because no exigent circumstances prevented the authorities from seeking a magistrate\'s authorization so to probe De Hernandez\' abdominal cavity, the proffered alternative "choice" of a warrantless x-ray was just as impermissible as the 27-hour detention that actually occurred.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>I believe that De Hernandez\' detention violated the Fourth Amendment for an additional reason:  it was not supported by probable cause.  In the domestic context, a detention of the sort that occurred here would be permissible only if there were probable cause at the outset.  <em>See, e.g., Hayes v.

[<a href="#F2/34" name="T2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>]  But the justifications for the border exception necessarily limit its breadth.  The exception derives from the unqestioned and paramount interest in</p>\n<p>"national self-protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in."</p>\n<p><em>Carroll v. United States,</em> 267 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/267/132/case.html#154">267 U. S. 154</a></span>.  <em>See also Almeida-Sanchez v.

S. 272</a></span> (border exception is a reasonable condition for those "seeking to cross our borders"); <em>United States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Film,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/123/case.html">413 U.

S. 125</a></span> (1973) (border exception is a reasonable condition "to prevent prohibited articles from entry").  Subject only to the other applicable guarantees of the Bill of Rights, this interest in "national self-protection" is plenary.  Thus, as the Court notes, a suspected tuberculosis carrier may be detained at the border for medical testing and treatment as a condition of entry.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#544">473 U. S. 544</a></span>.  As a condition of entry, the traveler may be subjected to exhaustive processing and examinations, and his belongings may be scrutinized with exacting care. [<a href="#F2/35" name="T2/35">Footnote 2/35</a>]  I have no doubt as well that, <em>as a condition of entry,</em> travelers, in appropriate circumstances, may be required to excrete their bodily wastes for further scrutiny and to submit to diagnostic x-rays.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Court\'s reasoning, however, the Government, in carrying out such immigration and customs functions, does not simply have the two stark alternatives of either forcing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 473 U. S. 564</a></p><p> a traveler to submit to such procedures or allowing him to "pass . . . into the interior."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#544">473 U. S. 544</a></span>.  There is a third alternative:  to instruct the traveler who refuses to submit to burdensome but reasonable conditions of entry that he is free to turn around and leave the country.  In fact, I believe that the "reasonableness" of any burdensome requirement for entry is necessarily conditioned on the potential entrant\'s freedom to leave the country if he objects to that requirement.  Surely the Government\'s manifest interest in preventing potentially excludable individuals carrying potential contraband from crossing our borders is fully vindicated if those individuals voluntarily decided not to cross the borders.  This does not, of course, mean that such individuals are not fully subject to the criminal laws while on American soil.  If there is probable cause to believe they have violated the law, they may be arrested just like any other person within our borders.  And if there is "reasonable suspicion" to believe they may be engaged in such violations, they may briefly be detained pursuant to <em>Terry</em> for further investigation, subject to the same limitations and conditions governing <em>Terry</em> stops anywhere else in the country. [<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>]  But if such <em>Terry</em> suspicion does not promptly ripen into probable cause, such travelers must be given a meaningful choice:  either agree to further detention as a condition of eventual entry or leave the country.  The Government disagrees.  We were advised at oral argument that it "definitely" is the policy of customs authorities "not to allow such people, if they\'re reasonably suspected of drug smuggling, to return before that suspicion can be checked out," and that, whether citizen, resident alien, or alien, "[w]e would not simply let them go back."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 48.  The result is to sanction an authoritarian twilight zone on the border.  The suspicious-looking traveler may not enter the country.  Nor may he leave.  Instead, he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 473 U. S. 565</a></p><p> is trapped on the border.  Because he is on American soil, he is fully subject "to the criminal enforcement powers of the Federal Government."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/531/case.html#539">473 U. S. 539</a></span>, citing 19 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 482.  But notwithstanding that he is on American soil, he is not fully protected by the guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable everywhere else in the country.  To be sure, a watered-down "reasonableness" requirement will technically govern such detentions, but it will accommodate itself to assaults on privacy and personal autonomy that would not for one moment pass constitutional muster anywhere else in the country, and that would surely provide grounds for an open-and-shut damages action for violations of basic civil rights if conducted anywhere but on the border.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the underlying premises of the "border exception" supports such a ring of unbridled authoritarianism surrounding freedom\'s soil.  If the traveler does not wish to consent to prolonged detentions or intrusive examinations, the Nation\'s customs and immigration interests are fully served by sending the traveler on his way elsewhere.  If the authorities nevertheless propose to detain the traveler for purposes of subjecting him to criminal investigation and possible arrest and punishment, they may do so only pursuant to constitutional safeguards applicable to everyone else in the country.  <em>See Wong Wing v. United States,</em> 163 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/228/case.html#236">163 U. S. 236</a></span>-238; <em>Abel v.

[<a href="#F2/37" name="T2/37">Footnote 2/37</a>]  Chief among those safeguards is the requirement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="566">Page 473 U.

Other rights, such as that to an impartial jury or the aid of counsel, are within the supervisory power of the courts themselves.  Such a right as just compensation for the taking of private property may be vindicated after the act in terms of money."</p>\n<p>"But an illegal search and seizure usually is a single incident, perpetrated by surprise, conducted in haste, kept purposely beyond the court\'s supervision, and limited only by the judgment and moderation of officers whose own interests and records are often at stake in the search.

To be sure, forcing law enforcement personnel to obtain a warrant before engaging in a search will predictably deter the police from conducting some searches that they would otherwise like to conduct.  But this is not an unintended <em>result</em> of the Fourth Amendment\'s protection of privacy; rather, it is the very <em>purpose</em> for which the Amendment was thought necessary.  Only where the governmental interests at stake exceed those implicated in any ordinary law enforcement context -- that is, only where there is some extraordinary governmental interest involved -- is it legitimate to engage in a balancing test to determine whether a warrant is indeed necessary."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/21" name="F2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]</p>\n<p>"Once the suspect is in custody, . . . the reasons that justify dispensing with the magistrate\'s neutral judgment evaporate.  There no longer is any danger that the suspect will escape or commit further crimes while the police submit their evidence to a magistrate.  And, while the State\'s reasons for taking summary action subside, the suspect\'s need for a neutral determination of probable cause increases significantly.  The consequences of prolonged detention may be more serious than the interference occasioned by arrest. . . .  When the stakes are this high, the detached judgment of a neutral magistrate is essential if the Fourth Amendment is to furnish meaningful protection from unfounded interference with liberty."</p>\n<p><em>Gerstein v.
