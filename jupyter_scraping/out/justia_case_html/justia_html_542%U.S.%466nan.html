Petitioners, 2 Australians and 12 Kuwaitis captured abroad during the hostilities, are being held in military custody at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas.  Petitioners filed suits under federal law challenging the legality of their detention, alleging that they had never been combatants against the United States or engaged in terrorist acts, and that they have never been charged with wrongdoing, permitted to consult counsel, or provided access to courts or other tribunals.  The District Court construed the suits as habeas petitions and dismissed them for want of jurisdiction, holding that, under <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a>, aliens detained outside United States sovereign territory may not invoke habeas relief.

C. \xc2\xa72241, which authorizes district courts, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions,\xe2\x80\x9d to entertain habeas applications by persons claiming to be held \xe2\x80\x9cin custody in violation of the \xe2\x80\xa6 laws \xe2\x80\xa6 of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72241(a), (c)(3).  Such jurisdiction extends to aliens held in a territory over which the United States exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction, but not \xe2\x80\x9cultimate sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects respondents\xe2\x80\x99 primary submission that these cases are controlled by <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a District Court lacked authority to grant habeas relief to German citizens captured by U. S. forces in China, tried and convicted of war crimes by an American military commission headquartered in Nanking, and incarcerated in occupied Germany.  Reversing a Court of Appeals judgment finding jurisdiction, the <em>Eisentrager </em>Court found six critical facts: The German prisoners were (a) enemy aliens who (b) had never been or resided in the United States, (c) were captured outside U. S. territory and there held in military custody, (d) were there tried and convicted by the military (e) for offenses committed there, and (f) were imprisoned there at all times.  339 U. S., at 777.  Petitioners here differ from the <em>Eisentrager</em> detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against this country; they have never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.  The <em>Eisentrager</em> Court also made clear that all six of the noted critical facts were relevant only to the question of the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 <em>constitutional</em> entitlement to habeas review.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only statement on their <em>statutory</em> entitlement was a passing reference to its absence.  <em>Id.,</em> at 768.  This cursory treatment is explained by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s then-recent decision in <em>Ahrens</em> v. <em>Clark,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/188/index.html">335 U. S. 188</a>, in which it held that the District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction to entertain the habeas claims of aliens detained at Ellis Island because the habeas statute\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d required the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 presence within the court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction, <em>id.,</em> at 192.  However, the Court later held, in <em>Braden</em> v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html">410 U. S. 484</a>, 494\xe2\x80\x93495, that such presence is not \xe2\x80\x9can invariable prerequisite\xe2\x80\x9d to the exercise of \xc2\xa72241 jurisdiction because habeas acts upon the person holding the prisoner, not the prisoner himself, so that the court acts \xe2\x80\x9cwithin [its] respective jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d if the custodian can be reached by service of process.  Because <em>Braden </em>overruled the statutory predicate to <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding, <em>Eisentrager </em>does not preclude the exercise of \xc2\xa72241 jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that \xc2\xa72241 is limited by the principle that legislation is presumed not to have extraterritorial application unless Congress clearly manifests such an intent, <em>EEOC</em> v. <em>Arabian American Oil Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/index.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 248.  That presumption has no application to the operation of the habeas statute with respect to persons detained within \xe2\x80\x9cthe [United States\xe2\x80\x99] territorial jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foley Bros., Inc.</em> v. <em>Filardo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/336/281/index.html">336 U. S. 281</a>, 285.  By the express terms of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over the Guantanamo Base, and may continue to do so permanently if it chooses.  Respondents concede that the habeas statute would create federal-court jurisdiction over the claims of an American citizen held at the base.  Considering that \xc2\xa72241 draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there is little reason to think that Congress intended the statute\xe2\x80\x99s geographical coverage to vary depending on the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship.  Aliens held at the base, like American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa72241 authority.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Petitioners contend that they are being held in federal custody in violation of United States laws, and the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 custodians is unquestioned, cf. <em>Braden,</em> 410 U. S., at 495.  Section 2241 requires nothing more and therefore confers jurisdiction on the District Court.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The District Court also has jurisdiction to hear the <em>Al Odah</em> petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint invoking 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71331, the federal question statute, and \xc2\xa71350, the Alien Tort Statute.  The Court of Appeals, again relying on <em>Eisentrager</em>, held that the District Court correctly dismissed these claims for want of jurisdiction because the petitioners lacked the privilege of litigation in U. S. courts.  Nothing in <em>Eisentrager</em> or any other of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the United States from that privilege.  United States courts have traditionally been open to nonresident aliens.  Cf. <em>Disconto Gesellschaft</em> v. <em>Umbreit,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/570/index.html">208 U. S. 570</a>, 578.  And indeed, \xc2\xa71350 explicitly confers the privilege of suing for an actionable \xe2\x80\x9ctort \xe2\x80\xa6 committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d on aliens alone.  The fact that petitioners are being held in military custody is immaterial.

While one of the four attacks was foiled by the heroism of the plane\xe2\x80\x99s passengers, the other three killed approximately 3,000 innocent civilians, destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of property, and severely damaged the U.

In response to the attacks, Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the President to use \xe2\x80\x9call necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks \xe2\x80\xa6 or harbored such organizations or persons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub.

Brief for United States 6.  The United States occupies the Base, which comprises 45 square miles of land and water along the southeast coast of Cuba, pursuant to a 1903 Lease Agreement executed with the newly independent Republic of Cuba in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War.  Under the Agreement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States recognizes the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the [leased areas],\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cthe Republic of Cuba consents that during the period of the occupation by the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 the United States shall exercise complete jurisdiction and control over and within said areas.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In 1934, the parties entered into a treaty providing that, absent an agreement to modify or abrogate the lease, the lease would remain in effect \xe2\x80\x9c[s]o long as the United States of America shall not abandon the \xe2\x80\xa6 naval station of Guantanamo.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, petitioners, through relatives acting as their next friends, filed various actions in the U.

All alleged that none of the petitioners has ever been a combatant against the United States or has ever engaged in any terrorist acts.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  They also alleged that none has been charged with any wrongdoing, permitted to consult with counsel, or provided access to the courts or any other tribunal.

Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah and the 11 other Kuwaiti detainees filed a complaint seeking to be informed of the charges against them, to be allowed to meet with their families and with counsel, and to have access to the courts or some other impartial tribunal.  <em>Id.,</em> at 34.

The statute  traces its ancestry to the first grant of federal court jurisdiction: Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized federal courts to issue the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners \xe2\x80\x9cin custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or committed for trial before some court of the same.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \xc2\xa714, 1 Stat. 82.

But \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U.

The Court has, for example, entertained the habeas petitions of an American citizen who plotted an attack on military installations during the Civil War, <em>Ex parte Milligan,</em> 4 Wall. 2 (1866), and of admitted enemy aliens convicted of war crimes during a declared war and held in the United States, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/1/index.html">317 U.

In that case, we held that a Federal District Court lacked authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus to 21 German citizens who had been captured by U.

The Court of Appeals in <em>Eisentrager</em> had found jurisdiction, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cany person who is deprived of his liberty by officials of the United States, acting under purported authority of that Government, and who can show that his confinement is in violation of a prohibition of the Constitution, has a right to the writ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eisentrager </em>v. <em>Forrestal,</em> 174 F.\xc2\xa02d 961, 963 (CADC 1949).  In reversing that determination, this Court summarized the six critical facts in the case:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe are here confronted with a decision whose basic premise is that these prisoners are entitled, as a constitutional right, to sue in some court of the United States for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>.  To support that assumption we must hold that a prisoner of our military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the writ, even though he (a) is an enemy alien; (b) has never been or resided in the United States; (c) was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war; (d) was tried and convicted by a Military Commission sitting outside the United States; (e) for offenses against laws of war committed outside the United States; (f) and is at all times imprisoned outside the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U.

The Court had far less to say on the question of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <em>statutory</em> entitlement to habeas review.  Its only statement on the subject was a passing reference to the absence of statutory authorization:  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 768.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reference to the historical context in which <em>Eisentrager </em>was decided explains why the opinion devoted so little attention to question of statutory jurisdiction.  In 1948, just two months after the <em>Eisentrager</em> petitioners filed their petition for habeas corpus in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia, this Court issued its decision in <em>Ahrens</em> v. <em>Clark,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/188/index.html">335 U. S. 188</a>, a case concerning the application of the habeas statute to the petitions of 120 Germans who were then being detained at Ellis Island, New York, for deportation to Germany.  The <em>Ahrens</em> detainees had also filed their petitions in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia, naming the Attorney General as the respondent.  Reading the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the habeas statute to require the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 presence within the district court\xe2\x80\x99s territorial jurisdiction, the Court held that the District of Columbia court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 192.  <em>Ahrens</em> expressly reserved the question \xe2\x80\x9cof what process, if any, a person confined in an area not subject to the jurisdiction of any district court may employ to assert federal rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> 192, n.\xc2\xa04.  But as the dissent noted, if the presence of the petitioner in the territorial jurisdiction of a federal district court were truly a jurisdictional requirement, there could be only one response to that question.  <em>Id.,</em> at 209 (opinion of Rutledge, J.).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the District Court for the District of Columbia reviewed the German prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 habeas application in <em>Eisentrager</em>, it thus dismissed their action on the authority of <em>Ahrens</em>.  See <em>Eisentrager,</em> 339 U. S., at 767, 790.  Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, it implicitly conceded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under the habeas statute as it had been interpreted in <em>Ahrens</em>.  The Court of Appeals instead held that petitioners had a constitutional right to habeas corpus secured by the Suspension Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa02, reasoning that \xe2\x80\x9cif a person has a right to a writ of habeas corpus, he cannot be deprived of the privilege by an omission in a federal jurisdictional statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eisentrager </em>v. <em>Forrestal,</em> 174 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 965.  In essence, the Court of Appeals concluded that the habeas statute, as construed in <em>Ahrens</em>, had created an unconstitutional gap that had to be filled by reference to \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentals.\xe2\x80\x9d  174 F.\xc2\xa02d<em>,</em> at 963.  In its review of that decision, this Court, like the Court of Appeals, proceeded from the premise that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in our statutes\xe2\x80\x9d conferred federal-court jurisdiction, and accordingly evaluated the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 resort to \xe2\x80\x9cfundamentals\xe2\x80\x9d on its own terms.  339 U.

Rather, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the person who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody,\xe2\x80\x9d a district court acts \xe2\x80\x9cwithin [its] respective jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72241 as long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe custodian can be reached by service of process.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 U.

These developments included, notably, decisions of this Court in cases involving habeas petitioners \xe2\x80\x9cconfined overseas (and thus outside the territory of any district court),\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Court \xe2\x80\x9cheld, if only implicitly, that the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 absence from the district does not present a jurisdictional obstacle to the consideration of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 498 (citing <em>Burns</em> v. <em>Wilson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/137/index.html">346 U.

While I reach the same conclusion, my analysis follows a different course.  Justice Scalia exposes the weakness in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>Braden</em> v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html">410 U. S. 484</a> (1973), \xe2\x80\x9coverruled the statutory predicate to <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  As he explains, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach is not a plausible reading of <em>Braden </em>or<em> Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950).  In my view, the correct course is to follow the framework of <em>Eisentrager.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Eisentrager</em> considered the scope of the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus against the backdrop of the constitutional command of the separation of powers.  The issue before the Court was whether the Judiciary could exercise jurisdiction over the claims of German prisoners held in the Landsberg prison in Germany following the cessation of hostilities in Europe.  The Court concluded the petition could not be entertained.  The petition was not within the proper realm of the judicial power.  It concerned matters within the exclusive province of the Executive, or the Executive and Congress, to determine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court began by noting the \xe2\x80\x9cascending scale of rights\xe2\x80\x9d that courts have recognized for individuals depending on their connection to the United States.  <em>Id</em>., at 770.  Citizenship provides a longstanding basis for jurisdiction, the Court noted, and among aliens physical presence within the United States also \xe2\x80\x9cgave the Judiciary power to act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 769, 771.  This contrasted with the \xe2\x80\x9cessential pattern for seasonable Executive constraint of enemy aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 773.  The place of the detention was also important to the jurisdictional question, the Court noted.  Physical presence in the United States \xe2\x80\x9cimplied protection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 777\xe2\x80\x93778, whereas in <em>Eisentrager</em> \xe2\x80\x9cth[e] prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 778.  The Court next noted that the prisoners in <em>Eisentrager</em> \xe2\x80\x9cwere actual enemies\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States, proven to be so at trial, and thus could not justify \xe2\x80\x9ca limited opening of our courts\xe2\x80\x9d to distinguish the \xe2\x80\x9cmany [aliens] of friendly personal disposition to whom the status of enemy\xe2\x80\x9d was unproven.  <em>Id</em>., at 778.  Finally, the Court considered the extent to which jurisdiction would \xe2\x80\x9champer the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 779.  Because the prisoners in <em>Eisentrager</em> were proven enemy aliens found and detained outside the United States, and because the existence of jurisdiction would have had a clear harmful effect on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s military affairs, the matter was appropriately left to the Executive Branch and there was no jurisdiction for the courts to hear the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decision in <em>Eisentrager</em> indicates that there is a realm of political authority over military affairs where the judicial power may not enter.  The existence of this realm acknowledges the power of the President as Commander in Chief, and the joint role of the President and the Congress, in the conduct of military affairs.  A faithful application of <em>Eisentrager</em>, then, requires an initial inquiry into the general circumstances of the detention to determine whether the Court has the authority to entertain the petition and to grant relief after considering all of the facts presented.  A necessary corollary of <em>Eisentrager</em> is that there are circumstances in which the courts maintain the power and the responsibility to protect persons from unlawful detention even where military affairs are implicated.  See also <em>Ex parte Milligan,</em> 4 Wall. 2 (1866).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>Eisentrager </em>in two critical ways, leading to the conclusion that a federal court may entertain the petitions.  First, Guantanamo Bay is in every practical respect a United States territory, and it is one far removed from any hostilities.  The opinion of the Court well explains the history of its possession by the United States.  In a formal sense, the United States leases the Bay; the 1903 lease agreement states that Cuba retains \xe2\x80\x9cultimate sovereignty\xe2\x80\x9d over it.  Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III, T. S. No. 418.  At the same time, this lease is no ordinary lease.  Its term is indefinite and at the discretion of the United States.  What matters is the unchallenged and indefinite control that the United States has long exercised over Guantanamo Bay.  From a practical perspective, the indefinite lease of Guantanamo Bay has produced a place that belongs to the United States, extending the \xe2\x80\x9cimplied protection\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States to it.  <em>Eisentrager, supra,</em> at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second critical set of facts is that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay are being held indefinitely, and without benefit of any legal proceeding to determine their status.  In <em>Eisentrager</em>, the prisoners were tried and convicted by a military commission of violating the laws of war and were sentenced to prison terms.  Having already been subject to procedures establishing their status, they could not justify \xe2\x80\x9ca limited opening of our courts\xe2\x80\x9d to show that they were \xe2\x80\x9cof friendly personal disposition\xe2\x80\x9d and not enemy aliens.  339 U. S., at 778.  Indefinite detention without trial or other proceeding presents altogether different considerations.  It allows friends and foes alike to remain in detention.  It suggests a weaker case of military necessity and much greater alignment with the traditional function of habeas corpus.  Perhaps, where detainees are taken from a zone of hostilities, detention without proceedings or trial would be justified by military necessity for a matter of weeks; but as the period of detention stretches from months to years, the case for continued detention to meet military exigencies becomes weaker.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the status of Guantanamo Bay and the indefinite pretrial detention of the detainees, I would hold that federal-court jurisdiction is permitted in these cases.  This approach would avoid creating automatic statutory authority to adjudicate the claims of persons located outside the United States, and remains true to the reasoning of <em>Eisentrager</em>.  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961649">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nRASUL V.

This is not only a novel holding; it contradicts a half-century-old precedent on which the military undoubtedly relied, <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/763/index.html">339 U. S. 763</a> (1950).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s contention that <em>Eisentrager</em> was somehow negated by <em>Braden</em> v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/484/index.html">410 U. S. 484</a> (1973)\xe2\x80\x94a decision that dealt with a different issue and did not so much as mention <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x94is implausible in the extreme.

I would leave it to Congress to change \xc2\xa72241, and dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented holding.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have repeatedly said: \xe2\x80\x9cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.  It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction . . .\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kokkonen</em> v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/375/index.html">511 U. S. 375</a>, 377 (1994) (citations omitted).  The petitioners do not argue that the Constitution independently requires jurisdiction here.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Accordingly, this case turns on the words of \xc2\xa72241, a text the Court today largely ignores.  Even a cursory reading of the habeas statute shows that it presupposes a federal district court with territorial jurisdiction over the detainee.  Section 2241(a) states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWrits of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge <em>within their respective jurisdictions</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIt further requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he order of a circuit judge shall be entered in the records of <em>the</em> district court of <em>the district wherein the restraint complained of is had</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72241(a) (emphases added).  And \xc2\xa72242 provides that a petition \xe2\x80\x9caddressed to the Supreme Court, a justice thereof or a circuit judge . .\xc2\xa0. shall state the reasons for not making application to <em>the</em> district court of <em>the district</em> <em>in which the applicant is held</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphases added).  No matter to whom the writ is directed, custodian or detainee, the statute could not be clearer that a necessary requirement for issuing the writ is that <em>some</em> federal district court have territorial jurisdiction over the detainee.  Here, as the Court allows, see <em>ante</em>, at 10, the Guantanamo Bay detainees are not located within the territorial jurisdiction of any federal district court.  One would think that is the end of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asserts, however, that the decisions of this Court have placed a gloss on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72241 which allows jurisdiction in this case.  That is not so.  In fact, the only case in point holds just the opposite (and just what the statute plainly says).  That case is <em>Eisentrager</em>, but to fully understand its implications for the present dispute, I must also discuss our decisions in the earlier case of <em>Ahrens</em> v. <em>Clark,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/188/index.html">335 U. S. 188</a> (1948), and the later case of <em>Braden</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Ahrens</em>, the Court considered \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of the person detained is prerequisite to filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\xe2\x80\x9d  335 U. S., at 189 (construing 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7452, the statutory precursor to \xc2\xa72241).  The <em>Ahrens</em> detainees were held at Ellis Island, New York, but brought their petitions in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cwithin their respective jurisdictions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that a district court has jurisdiction to issue the writ only on behalf of petitioners detained within its territorial jurisdiction.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cnot sufficient . . . that the jailer or custodian alone be found in the jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  335 U. S., at 190.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Ahrens</em> explicitly reserved \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of what process, if any, a person confined in an area not subject to the jurisdiction of any district court may employ to assert federal rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 192, n.\xc2\xa04.  That question, the same question presented to this Court today, was shortly thereafter resolved in <em>Eisentrager</em> insofar as noncitizens are concerned.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved petitions for writs of habeas corpus filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia by German nationals imprisoned in Landsberg Prison, Germany.  The District Court, relying on <em>Ahrens</em>, dismissed the petitions because the petitioners were not located within its territorial jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  According to the Court today, the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9cimplicitly conceded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under the habeas statute as it had been interpreted in <em>Ahrens</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n essence . . . concluded that the habeas statute, as construed in <em>Ahrens</em>, had created an unconstitutional gap that had to be filled by reference to \xe2\x80\x98fundamentals.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  That is not so.  The Court of Appeals concluded that there <em>was</em> statutory jurisdiction.  It arrived at that conclusion by applying the canon of constitutional avoidance: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the existing jurisdictional act be construed to deny the writ to a person entitled to it as a substantive right, the act would be unconstitutional.  It should be construed, if possible, to avoid that result.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eisentrager</em> v. <em>Forrestal</em>, 174 F.\xc2\xa02d 961, 966 (CADC 1949).  In cases where there was no territorial jurisdiction over the detainee, the Court of Appeals held, the writ would lie at the place of a respondent with directive power over the detainee.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not too violent an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98custody\xe2\x80\x99 to construe it as including those who have directive custody, as well as those who have immediate custody, where such interpretation is necessary to comply with constitutional requirements. . . . <em>The statute must be so construed</em>, lest it be invalid as constituting a suspension of the writ in violation of the constitutional provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 967 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in <em>Eisentrager</em> reversed the Court of Appeals.  The opinion was largely devoted to rejecting the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional analysis, since the doctrine of constitutional avoidance underlay its statutory conclusion.  But the opinion <em>had</em> to pass judgment on whether the statute granted jurisdiction, since that was the basis for the judgments of both lower courts.  A conclusion of no constitutionally conferred right would obviously not support reversal of a judgment that rested upon a statutorily conferred right.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And absence of a right to the writ under the clear wording of the habeas statute is what the <em>Eisentrager</em> opinion held: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, <em>nor does anything in our statutes</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 768 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hese prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment <em>were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 781 (concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cno right to the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> appears\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 790 (finding \xe2\x80\x9cno basis for invoking federal judicial power in any district\xe2\x80\x9d).  The brevity of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory analysis signifies nothing more than that the Court considered it obvious (as indeed it is) that, unaided by the canon of constitutional avoidance, the statute did not confer jurisdiction over an alien detained outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s directly-on-point statutory holding makes it exceedingly difficult for the Court to reach the result it desires today.  To do so neatly and cleanly, it must either argue that our decision in <em>Braden</em> overruled <em>Eisentrager</em>, or admit that <em>it</em> is overruling <em>Eisentrager</em>.  The former course would not pass the laugh test, inasmuch as <em>Braden</em> dealt with a detainee held within the territorial jurisdiction of a district court, and never <em>mentioned Eisentrager</em>.  And the latter course would require the Court to explain why our almost categorical rule of <em>stare decisis</em> in statutory cases should be set aside in order to complicate the present war, <em>and</em>, having set it aside, to explain why the habeas statute does not mean what it plainly says.  So instead the Court tries an oblique course: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Braden</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d it claims, \xe2\x80\x9coverruled <em>the statutory predicate </em>to <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11 (emphasis added), by which it means the statutory analysis of <em>Ahrens</em>.  Even assuming, for the moment, that <em>Braden </em>overruled some aspect of <em>Ahrens</em>, inasmuch as <em>Ahrens</em> did not pass upon any of the statutory issues decided by <em>Eisentrager</em>, it is hard to see how any of that case\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory predicate\xe2\x80\x9d could have been impaired.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But in fact <em>Braden</em> did not overrule <em>Ahrens;</em> it distinguished <em>Ahrens</em>.  <em>Braden</em> dealt with a habeas petitioner incarcerated in Alabama.  The petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in Kentucky, challenging an indictment that had been filed against him in that Commonwealth and naming as respondent the Kentucky court in which the proceedings were pending.  This Court held that Braden was in custody because a detainer had been issued against him by Kentucky, and was being executed by Alabama, serving as an agent for Kentucky.  We found that jurisdiction existed in Kentucky for Braden\xe2\x80\x99s petition challenging the Kentucky detainer, notwithstanding his physical confinement in Alabama.  <em>Braden</em> was careful to <em>distinguish</em> that situation from the general rule established in <em>Ahrens</em>. </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA further, <em>critical</em> development since our decision in <em>Ahrens</em> is the emergence of <em>new classes of prisoners</em> who are able to petition for habeas corpus because of the adoption of a more expansive definition of the \xe2\x80\x98custody\xe2\x80\x99 requirement of the habeas statute.  The overruling of <em>McNally</em> v. <em>Hill,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/293/131/index.html">293 U. S. 131</a> (1934), made it possible for prisoners in custody under one sentence to attack a sentence which they had not yet begun to serve.  And it also enabled a petitioner held in one State to attack a detainer lodged against him by another State.  In such a case, the State holding the prisoner in immediate confinement acts as agent for the demanding State, and the custodian State is presumably indifferent to the resolution of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the detainer.  Here, for example, the petitioner is confined in Alabama, but his dispute is with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not the State of Alabama.  <em>Under these circumstances</em>, it would serve no useful purpose to apply the <em>Ahrens</em> rule and require that the action be brought in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 U. S., at 498\xe2\x80\x93499 (citations and footnotes omitted; emphases added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis cannot conceivably be construed as an overturning of the <em>Ahrens</em> rule <em>in other circumstances</em>.  See also <em>Braden</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (noting that <em>Ahrens</em> does not establish \xe2\x80\x9can inflexible jurisdictional rule dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum <em>even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of that decision</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Thus, <em>Braden</em> stands for the proposition, and only the proposition, that where a petitioner is in custody in multiple jurisdictions within the United States, he may seek a writ of habeas corpus in a jurisdiction in which he suffers legal confinement, though not physical confinement, if his challenge is to that legal confinement.  Outside that class of cases, <em>Braden </em>did not question the general rule of <em>Ahrens</em> (much less that of <em>Eisentrager</em>).  Where, as here, present physical custody is at issue, <em>Braden </em>is inapposite, and <em>Eisentrager</em> unquestionably controls.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The considerations of forum convenience that drove the analysis in <em>Braden</em> do not call into question <em>Eisentrager</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  The <em>Braden</em> opinion is littered with venue reasoning of the following sort: \xe2\x80\x9cThe expense and risk of transporting the petitioner to the Western District of Kentucky, should his presence at a hearing prove necessary, would in all likelihood be outweighed by the difficulties of transporting records and witnesses from Kentucky to the district where petitioner is confined.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 U. S., at 494.  Of course nothing could be <em>more</em> inconvenient than what the Court (on the alleged authority of <em>Braden</em>) prescribes today: a domestic hearing for persons held abroad, dealing with events that transpired abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attempting to paint <em>Braden</em> as a refutation of <em>Ahrens</em> (and thereby, it is suggested, <em>Eisentrager</em>), today\xe2\x80\x99s Court imprecisely describes <em>Braden</em> as citing with approval post-<em>Ahrens</em> cases in which \xe2\x80\x9chabeas petitioners\xe2\x80\x9d located overseas were allowed to proceed (without consideration of the jurisdictional issue) in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  In fact, what <em>Braden</em> said is that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here <em>American citizens</em> confined overseas (and thus outside the territory of any district court) have sought relief in habeas corpus, we have held, if only implicitly, that the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 absence from the district does not present a jurisdictional obstacle to consideration of the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  410 U. S., at 498 (emphasis added).  Of course \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/343/index.html">518 U. S. 343</a>, 352, n.\xc2\xa02 (1996) (citing cases), but we need not \xe2\x80\x9coverrule\xe2\x80\x9d those implicit holdings to decide this case.  Since <em>Eisentrager</em> <em>itself</em> made an exception for such cases, they in no way impugn its holding. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Eisentrager</em> said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are now little concerned, except to set his case apart <em>as untouched by this decision </em>and to take measure of the difference between his status and that of all categories of aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 769.  The constitutional doubt that the Court of Appeals in <em>Eisentrager</em> had erroneously attributed to the lack of habeas for an alien abroad might indeed exist with regard to a <em>citizen</em> abroad\xe2\x80\x94justifying a strained construction of the habeas statute, or (more honestly) a determination of constitutional right to habeas.  Neither party to the present case challenges the atextual extension of the habeas statute to United States citizens held beyond the territorial jurisdictions of the United States courts; but the possibility of one atextual exception thought to be required by the Constitution is no justification for abandoning the clear application of the text to a situation in which it raises no constitutional doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reality is this: Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion alone, overrules <em>Eisentrager;</em> today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion alone, extends the habeas statute, for the first time, to aliens held beyond the sovereign territory of the United States and beyond the territorial jurisdiction of its courts.  No reasons are given for this result; no acknowledgment of its consequences made.  By spurious reliance on <em>Braden</em> the Court evades explaining why <em>stare decisis</em> can be disregarded, <em>and why Eisentrager was wrong</em>.  Normally, we consider the interests of those who have relied on our decisions.  Today, the Court springs a trap on the Executive, subjecting Guantanamo Bay to the oversight of the federal courts even though it has never before been thought to be within their jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94and thus making it a foolish place to have housed alien wartime detainees.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In abandoning the venerable statutory line drawn in <em>Eisentrager</em>, the Court boldly extends the scope of the habeas statute to the four corners of the earth.  Part III of its opinion asserts that <em>Braden</em> stands for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9ca district court acts \xe2\x80\x98within [its] respective jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of \xc2\xa72241 as long as \xe2\x80\x98the custodian can be reached by service of process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Endorsement of that proposition is repeated in Part IV.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 2241, by its terms, requires nothing more [than the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 custodians]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The consequence of this holding, as applied to aliens outside the country, is breathtaking.  It permits an alien captured in a foreign theater of active combat to bring a \xc2\xa72241 petition against the Secretary of Defense.  Over the course of the last century, the United States has held millions of alien prisoners abroad.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Department of Army, G. Lewis &amp; J. Mewha, History of Prisoner of War Utilization by the United States Army 1776\xe2\x80\x931945, Pamphlet No. 20\xe2\x80\x93213, p. 244 (1955) (noting that, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y the end of hostilities [in World War II], U. S. forces had in custody approximately two million enemy soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d).  A great many of these prisoners would no doubt have complained about the circumstances of their capture and the terms of their confinement.  The military is currently detaining over 600 prisoners at Guantanamo Bay alone; each detainee undoubtedly has complaints\xe2\x80\x94real or contrived\xe2\x80\x94about those terms and circumstances.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s unheralded expansion of federal-court jurisdiction is not even mitigated by a comforting assurance that the legion of ensuing claims will be easily resolved on the merits.  To the contrary, the Court says that the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]etitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegations . . . unquestionably describe \xe2\x80\x98custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa015 (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/259/index.html">494 U. S. 259</a>, 277\xe2\x80\x93278 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  From this point forward, federal courts will entertain petitions from these prisoners, and others like them around the world, challenging actions and events far away, and forcing the courts to oversee one aspect of the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of a foreign war.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s carefree Court disregards, without a word of acknowledgment, the dire warning of a more circumspect Court in <em>Eisentrager:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo grant the writ to these prisoners might mean that our army must transport them across the seas for hearing.  This would require allocation for shipping space, guarding personnel, billeting and rations.  It might also require transportation for whatever witnesses the prisoners desired to call as well as transportation for those necessary to defend legality of the sentence.  The writ, since it is held to be a matter of right, would be equally available to enemies during active hostilities as in the present twilight between war and peace.  Such trials would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy.  They would diminish the prestige of our commanders, not only with enemies but with wavering neutrals.  It would be difficult to devise more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.  Nor is it unlikely that the result of such enemy litigiousness would be conflict between judicial and military opinion highly comforting to enemies of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 778\xe2\x80\x93779.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese results should not be brought about lightly, and certainly not without a textual basis in the statute and on the strength of nothing more than a decision dealing with an Alabama prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to seek habeas in Kentucky.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Part IV of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, dealing with the status of Guantanamo Bay, is a puzzlement. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court might have made an effort (a vain one, as I shall discuss) to distinguish Eisentrager</em> on the basis of a difference between the status of Landsberg Prison in Germany and Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.  But Part III flatly rejected such an approach, holding that the place of detention of an alien has no bearing on the statutory availability of habeas relief, but \xe2\x80\x9cis strictly relevant only to the question of the appropriate forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  That rejection is repeated at the end of Part IV: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, the answer to the question presented is clear. . . . No party questions the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 custodians.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Section 2241, by its terms, requires nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  Once that has been said, the status of Guantanamo Bay is entirely irrelevant to the issue here.  The habeas statute is (according to the Court) being applied <em>domestically</em>, to \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 custodians,\xe2\x80\x9d and the doctrine that statutes are presumed to have no extraterritorial effect simply has no application.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the Court spends most of Part IV rejecting respondents\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of that doctrine on the peculiar ground that it has no application to Guantanamo Bay.  Of course if the Court is right about that, not only \xc2\xa72241 but presumably <em>all</em> United States law applies there\xe2\x80\x94including, for example, the federal cause of action recognized in <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), which would allow prisoners to sue their captors for damages.  Fortunately, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant discussion also happens to be wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court gives only two reasons why the presumption against extraterritorial effect does not apply to Guantanamo Bay.  First, the Court says (without any further elaboration) that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States exercises \xe2\x80\x98complete jurisdiction and control\xe2\x80\x99 over the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base [under the terms of a 1903 lease agreement], and may continue to exercise such control permanently if it so chooses [under the terms of a 1934 Treaty].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12; see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  But that lease agreement explicitly recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the [leased areas],\xe2\x80\x9d Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III, T. S. No. 418, and the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x94whose head is \xe2\x80\x9cexclusively responsible\xe2\x80\x9d for the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct of diplomatic and foreign affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Eisentrager</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 789\xe2\x80\x94affirms that the lease and treaty do not render Guantanamo Bay the sovereign territory of the United States, see Brief for Respondents 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not explain how \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete jurisdiction and control\xe2\x80\x9d without sovereignty causes an enclave to be part of the United States for purposes of its domestic laws.  Since \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction and control\xe2\x80\x9d obtained through a lease is no different in effect from \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction and control\xe2\x80\x9d acquired by lawful force of arms, parts of Afghanistan and Iraq should logically be regarded as subject to our domestic laws.  Indeed, if \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction and control\xe2\x80\x9d rather than sovereignty were the test, so should the Landsberg Prison in Germany, where the United States held the <em>Eisentrager</em> detainees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second and last reason the Court gives for the proposition that domestic law applies to Guantanamo Bay is the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s concession that there would be habeas jurisdiction over a United States citizen in Guantanamo Bay.  \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering that the statute draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there is little reason to think that Congress intended the geographical coverage of the statute to vary depending on the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But the reason the Solicitor General conceded there would be jurisdiction over a detainee who was a United States citizen had <em>nothing to do</em> with the special status of Guantanamo Bay: \xe2\x80\x9cOur answer to that question, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the United States, because of their constitutional circumstances, may have greater rights with respect to the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the Court has or would interpret it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  And <em>that</em> position\xe2\x80\x94the position that United States citizens throughout the world may be entitled to habeas corpus rights\xe2\x80\x94is precisely the position that this Court adopted in <em>Eisentrager</em>, see 339 U. S., at 769\xe2\x80\x93770, even while holding that aliens abroad <em>did not have</em> habeas corpus rights.  Quite obviously, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s second reason has no force whatever.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The last part of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Part IV analysis digresses from the point that the presumption against extraterritorial application does not apply to Guantanamo Bay.  Rather, it is directed to the contention that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach to habeas jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94applying it to aliens abroad\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the historical reach of the writ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  None of the authorities it cites comes close to supporting that claim.  Its first set of authorities involves claims by aliens detained in what is indisputably domestic territory.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa011.  Those cases are irrelevant because they do not purport to address the territorial reach of the writ.  The remaining cases involve issuance of the writ to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exempt jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother dominions under the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and nn. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  These cases are inapposite for two reasons: Guantanamo Bay is not a sovereign dominion, and even if it were, jurisdiction would be limited to subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cExempt jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Cinque Ports and Counties Palatine (located in modern-day England)\xe2\x80\x94were local franchises granted by the Crown.  See 1 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 108, 532 (7th ed. rev. 1956); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *78\xe2\x80\x93*79 (hereinafter Blackstone).  These jurisdictions were \xe2\x80\x9cexempt\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that the Crown had ceded management of municipal affairs to local authorities, whose courts had exclusive jurisdiction over private disputes among residents (although review was still available in the royal courts by writ of error).  See <em>id.</em>, at *79.  Habeas jurisdiction nevertheless extended to those regions on the theory that the delegation of the King\xe2\x80\x99s authority did not include his own prerogative writs.  <em>Ibid.;</em> R.\xc2\xa0Sharpe, Law of Habeas Corpus 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Sharpe).  Guantanamo Bay involves no comparable local delegation of pre-existing sovereign authority.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases involving \xe2\x80\x9cother dominions under the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s control\xe2\x80\x9d fare no better.  These cases stand only for the proposition that the writ extended to dominions of the Crown outside England proper.  The authorities relating to Jersey and the other Channel Islands, for example, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa013, involve territories that are \xe2\x80\x9cdominions of the crown of Great Britain\xe2\x80\x9d even though not \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the kingdom of England,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Blackstone *102\xe2\x80\x93*105, much as were the colonies in America, <em>id.</em>, at *104\xe2\x80\x93*105, and Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, <em>id.</em>, at *93.  See also <em>King</em> v. <em>Cowle</em>, 2 Burr. 834, 853\xe2\x80\x93854, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 598 (K. B. 1759) (even if Berwick was \xe2\x80\x9cno part of the realm of England,\xe2\x80\x9d it was still a \xe2\x80\x9cdominion of the Crown\xe2\x80\x9d).  All of the dominions in the cases the Court cites\xe2\x80\x94and all of the territories Blackstone lists as dominions, see 1 Blackstone *93\xe2\x80\x93*106\xe2\x80\x94are the sovereign territory of the Crown: colonies, acquisitions and conquests, and so on.  It is an enormous extension of the term to apply it to installations merely leased for a particular use from another nation that still retains ultimate sovereignty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s historical analysis fails for yet another reason: To the extent the writ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary territorial ambit\xe2\x80\x9d did extend to exempt jurisdictions, outlying dominions, and the like, that extension applied only to British <em>subjects</em>.  The very sources the majority relies on say so: Sharpe explains the \xe2\x80\x9cbroader ambit\xe2\x80\x9d of the writ on the ground that it is \xe2\x80\x9csaid to depend not on the ordinary jurisdiction of the court for its effectiveness, but upon the authority of the sovereign over all her <em>subjects</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sharpe, <em>supra</em>, at 188 (emphasis added).  Likewise, Blackstone explained that the writ \xe2\x80\x9crun[s] into all parts of the king\xe2\x80\x99s dominions\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe king is at all times entitled to have an account why the liberty of any of his <em>subjects</em> is restrained.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Blackstone *131 (emphasis added).  <em>Ex parte Mwenya</em>, [1960] 1 Q. B. 241 (C.\xc2\xa0A.), which can hardly be viewed as evidence of the <em>historic</em> scope of the writ, only confirms the ongoing relevance of the sovereign-subject relationship to the scope of the writ.  There, the question was whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court of Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Bench can be debarred from making an order in favour of a British citizen unlawfully or arbitrarily detained\xe2\x80\x9d in Northern Rhodesia, which was at the time a protectorate of the Crown.  <em>Id.</em>, at 300 (Lord Evershed M.\xc2\xa0R.).  Each judge made clear that the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s status as a subject was material to the resolution of the case.  See <em>id.</em>, at 300, 302 (Lord Evershed, M.\xc2\xa0R.); <em>id.</em>, at 305 (Romer, L.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is difficult to see why the sovereign should be deprived of her right to be informed through her High Court as to the validity of the detention of her subjects in that territory\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 311 (Sellers, L.\xc2\xa0J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cI am not prepared to say, as we are solely asked to say on this appeal, that the English courts have no jurisdiction in any circumstances to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum in respect of an unlawful detention of a British subject in a British protectorate\xe2\x80\x9d).  None of the exempt-jurisdiction or dominion cases the Court cites involves someone not a subject of the Crown.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule against issuing the writ to aliens in foreign lands was still the law when, in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ning Yi-Ching</em>, 56 T. L.\xc2\xa0R. 3 (Vacation Ct. 1939), an English court considered the habeas claims of four Chinese subjects detained on criminal charges in Tientsin, China, an area over which Britain had by treaty acquired a lease and \xe2\x80\x9ctherewith exercised certain rights of administration and control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4.  The court held that Tientsin was a foreign territory, and that the writ would not issue to a foreigner detained there.  The Solicitor-General had argued that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was no case on record in which a writ of <em>habeas</em> <em>corpus</em> had been obtained on behalf of a foreign subject on foreign territory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 5, and the court \xe2\x80\x9clistened in vain for a case in which the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> had issued in respect of a foreigner detained in a part of the world which was not a part of the King\xe2\x80\x99s dominions or realm,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 6.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Guantanamo Bay, like its treatment of \xc2\xa72241, is a wrenching departure from precedent.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Departure from our rule of <em>stare decisis</em> in statutory cases is always extraordinary; it ought to be unthinkable when the departure has a potentially harmful effect upon the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s conduct of a war.  The Commander in Chief and his subordinates had every reason to expect that the internment of combatants at Guantanamo Bay would not have the consequence of bringing the cumbersome machinery of our domestic courts into military affairs.  Congress is in session.  If it wished to change federal judges\xe2\x80\x99 habeas jurisdiction from what this Court had previously held that to be, it could have done so.  And it could have done so by intelligent revision of the statute,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] instead of by today\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy, countertextual reinterpretation that confers upon wartime prisoners greater habeas rights than domestic detainees.  The latter must challenge their present physical confinement in the district of their confinement, see <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Padilla</em>, <em>ante</em>, whereas under today\xe2\x80\x99s strange holding Guantanamo Bay detainees can petition in any of the 94 federal judicial districts.  The fact that extraterritorially located detainees lack the district of detention that the statute requires has been converted from a factor that precludes their ability to bring a petition at all into a factor that frees them to petition wherever they wish\xe2\x80\x94and, as a result, to forum shop.  For this Court to create such a monstrous scheme in time of war, and in frustration of our military commanders\xe2\x80\x99 reliance upon clearly stated prior law, is judicial adventurism of the worst sort.

Indeed, the briefing in <em>Eisentrager</em> was mainly devoted to the question of whether there was statutory jurisdiction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Petitioner, O.

Instead, it argues that this Court in <em>Eisentrager</em> \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision to rest on constitutional and not statutory grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa08.  That is inherently implausible, given that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion clearly reached a statutory holding, and that both parties argued the case to this Court on that basis, see n.\xc2\xa02,<em> supra</em>.  The only evidence of misunderstanding the Court adduces today is the <em>Eisentrager </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning as \xe2\x80\x9cthat, although no statutory jurisdiction of such cases is given, courts must be held to possess it as part of the judicial power of the United States . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 767.  That is no misunderstanding, but an entirely accurate description of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reasoning\xe2\x80\x94the penultimate step of that reasoning rather than its conclusion.  The Court of Appeals went on to hold that, in light of the constitutional imperative, the statute should be interpreted as supplying jurisdiction.  See <em>Eisentrager</em> v. <em>Forrestal</em>, 174 F.\xc2\xa02d 961, 965\xe2\x80\x93967 (CADC 1949).  This Court in <em>Eisentrager</em> undoubtedly understood that, which is why it immediately followed the foregoing description with a description of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 <em>conclusion</em> tied to the language of the habeas statute: \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here deprivation of liberty by an official act occurs outside the territorial jurisdiction of any District Court, the petition will lie in the District Court which has territorial jurisdiction over officials who have directive power over the immediate jailer.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 767.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court points to Court of Appeals cases that have described <em>Braden</em> as \xe2\x80\x9coverruling\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ahrens</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa09.  Even if that description (rather than what I think the correct one, \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguishing\xe2\x80\x9d) is accepted, it would not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that <em>Ahrens </em>was overruled <em>with regard to the point on which Eisentrager relied</em>.  The <em>ratio decidendi</em> of <em>Braden</em> does not call into question the principle of <em>Ahrens</em> applied in <em>Eisentrager</em>: that habeas challenge to present physical confinement must be made in the district where the physical confinement exists.  The Court is unable to produce a single authority that agrees with its conclusion that <em>Braden</em> overruled <em>Eisentrager</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\nJustice Kennedy recognizes that <em>Eisentrager</em> controls, <em>ante</em>, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), but misconstrues that opinion.  He thinks it makes jurisdiction under the habeas statute turn on the circumstances of the detainees\xe2\x80\x99 confinement\xe2\x80\x94including, apparently, the availability of legal proceedings and the length of detention, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  The <em>Eisentrager</em> Court mentioned those circumstances, however, only in the course of its <em>constitutional </em>analysis, and not in its application of the statute.  It is quite impossible to read \xc2\xa72241<em> </em>as conditioning its geographic scope upon them.  Among the consequences of making jurisdiction turn upon circumstances of confinement are (1) that courts would <em>always </em>have authority to inquire into circumstances of  confinement, and (2) that the Executive would be unable to know with certainty that any given prisoner-of-war camp is immune from writs of habeas corpus.  And among the questions this approach raises: When does definite detention become indefinite?  How much process will suffice to stave off jurisdiction?  If there is a terrorist attack at Guantanamo Bay, will the area suddenly fall outside the habeas statute because it is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cfar removed from any hostilities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 3?  Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s approach provides enticing law-school-exam imponderables in an area where certainty is called for. </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court argues at some length that <em>Ex parte Mwenya</em>, [1960] 1 Q. B. 241 (C.\xc2\xa0A.), calls into question my reliance on <em>In\xc2\xa0re Ning Yi-Ching</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa014.  But as I have explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, <em>Mwenya</em> dealt with a British subject and the court went out of its way to explain that its expansive description of the scope of the writ was premised on that fact.  The Court cites not a single case holding that aliens held outside the territory of the sovereign were within reach of the writ.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court grasps at two other bases for jurisdiction: the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71350, and the federal-question statute, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331.  The former is not presented to us.  The ATS, while invoked below, was repudiated as a basis for jurisdiction by all petitioners, either in their petition for certiorari, in their briefing before this Court, or at oral argument.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93334, p. 2, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cPetitioners withdraw any reliance on the Alien Tort Claims Act\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioners in No. 03\xe2\x80\x93343, p. 13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.</p>\n<p>\n\nWith respect to \xc2\xa71331, petitioners assert a variety of claims arising under the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States.  In <em>Eisentrager</em>, though the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding focused on \xc2\xa72241, its analysis spoke more broadly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has been extended to aliens, whether friendly or enemy, only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection.  No such basis can be invoked here, for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 U. S., at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.  That reasoning dooms petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims under \xc2\xa71331, at least where Congress has erected a jurisdictional bar to their raising such claims in habeas.   </p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0It could, for example, provide for jurisdiction by placing Guantanamo Bay within the territory of an existing district court; or by creating a district court for Guantanamo Bay, as it did for the Panama Canal Zone, see 22 U.
