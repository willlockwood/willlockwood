S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b).  Granting respondent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petitioners had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable standard set forth in <em>Gartenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.</em>, 694 F.\xc2\xa02d 923, 928 (CA2): \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length in light of all of the surrounding circumstances\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. To be guilty of a violation of \xc2\xa736(b), \xe2\x80\xa6 the adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm\xe2\x80\x99s length bargaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rejecting the <em>Gartenberg </em>standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different reasoning.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Based on \xc2\xa736(b)\xe2\x80\x99s terms and the role that a shareholder action for breach of the investment adviser\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty plays in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure, <em>Gartenberg </em>applied the correct standard.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A consensus has developed regarding the standard <em>Gartenberg</em> set forth over 25 years ago:<em> </em>The standard has been adopted by other federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission\xe2\x80\x99s regulations have recognized, and formalized, <em>Gartenberg</em>-like factors. Both petitioners and respondents generally endorse the <em>Gartenberg</em> approach but disagree in some respects about its meaning.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Section 36(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty\xe2\x80\x9d phrase finds its meaning in <em>Pepper </em>v.<em> Linton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/308/295/index.html">308 U. S. 295</a>, 306\xe2\x80\x93307, where the Court discussed the concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: \xe2\x80\x9cThe essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length bargain.  If it does not, equity will set it aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gartenberg</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach fully incorporates this understanding, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into account and using the range of fees that might result from arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0<em>Gartenberg</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach also reflects \xc2\xa736(b)\xe2\x80\x99s place in the statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protections the Act affords investors.  Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see <em>Burks</em> v. <em>Lasker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/471/index.html">441 U. S. 471</a>, 482, and shareholder suits under \xc2\xa736(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling adviser conflicts of interest, see <em>Daily Income Fund, Inc.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/523/index.html">464 U. S. 523</a>, 541.  In recognition of the disinterested directors\xe2\x80\x99 role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s compensation \xe2\x80\x9csuch consideration \xe2\x80\xa6 as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(1).  It may be inferred from this formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a board\xe2\x80\x99s judgment may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate measure of deference varies depending on the circumstances.  <em>Gartenberg</em> heeds these precepts.  See 694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 930.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Court resolves the parties\xe2\x80\x99 disagreements on several important questions.  First, since the Act requires consideration of all relevant factors, \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in light of the similarities and differences between the services the clients in question require.  In doing so, the Court must be wary of inapt comparisons based on significant differences between those services and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between the two types of clients.  However, courts should not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds by other advisers, which may not result from arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length negotiations.  Finally, a court\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of an investment adviser\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.  Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors, their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differently. Cf<em>. Lasker, </em>441 U. S., at 486.  In contrast, where the board\xe2\x80\x99s process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome.  <em>Id.,</em> at 484.  <em>Gartenberg</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cso disproportionately large\xe2\x80\x9d standard, 694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 928, reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice to \xe2\x80\x9crely largely upon [independent] \xe2\x80\x98watchdogs\xe2\x80\x99 to protect shareholders interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lasker, supra</em>, at 482.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit erred in focusing on disclosure by investment advisers rather than the <em>Gartenberg </em>standard, which the panel rejected.  That standard may lack sharp analytical clarity, but it accurately reflects the compromise embodied in \xc2\xa736(b) as to the appropriate method of testing investment adviser compensation, and it has provided a workable standard for nearly three decades.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b) (hereinafter \xc2\xa736(b)).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), 54 Stat. 789, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x931 <em>et seq.</em>, regulates investment companies, including mutual funds.  \xe2\x80\x9cA mutual fund is a pool of assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securities, and belonging to the individual investors holding shares in the fund.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burks</em> v. <em>Lasker</em>, 441 U.\xe2\x80\x82S. 471, 480 (1979).  The following arrangements are typical.  A separate entity called an investment adviser creates the mutual fund, which may have no employees of its own.  See <em>Kamen</em> v. <em>Kemper Financial Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/90/index.html">500 U. S. 90</a>, 93 (1991); <em>Daily Income Fund, Inc.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/523/index.html">464 U. S. 523</a>, 536 (1984); <em>Burks</em>, 441 U. S., at 480\xe2\x80\x93481.  The adviser selects the fund\xe2\x80\x99s directors, manages the fund\xe2\x80\x99s investments, and provides other services.  See <em>id.,</em> at 481.  Because of the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, the fund often \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cannot, as a practical matter sever its relationship with the adviser.  Therefore, the forces of arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining do not work in the mutual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other sectors of the American economy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x93184, p.\xc2\xa05 (1969) (hereinafter S.\xc2\xa0Rep.)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCongress adopted the [Investment Company Act of 1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse inherent in the structure of investment companies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Recognizing that the relationship between a fund and its investment adviser was \xe2\x80\x9cfraught with potential conflicts of interest,\xe2\x80\x9d the Act created protections for mutual fund shareholders.  <em>Id.,</em> at 536\xe2\x80\x93538 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 482\xe2\x80\x93483.  Among other things, the Act required that no more than 60 percent of a fund\xe2\x80\x99s directors could be affiliated with the adviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by the directors and the shareholders of the fund.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710, 15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s and 1960\xe2\x80\x99s prompted studies of the 1940 Act\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness in protecting investors.  See <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, 464 U. S., at 537\xe2\x80\x93538.  Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identified problems relating to the independence of investment company boards and the compensation received by investment advisers.  See <em>ibid</em>.  In response to such concerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered shareholder protection in two primary ways.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the amendments strengthened the \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstone\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the independence of mutual fund boards of directors, which negotiate and scrutinize adviser compensation.  <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 482.  The amendments required that no more than 60 percent of a fund\xe2\x80\x99s directors be \xe2\x80\x9cpersons who are interested persons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.,</em> that they have no interest in or affiliation with the investment adviser.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  15 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9310(a); \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x932(a)(19); see also <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 538.  These board members are given \xe2\x80\x9ca host of special responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burks</em>, 441 U.\xe2\x80\x82S., at 482\xe2\x80\x93483.  In particular, they must \xe2\x80\x9creview and approve the contracts of the investment adviser\xe2\x80\x9d annually, <em>id.,</em> at 483, and a majority of these directors must approve an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s compensation, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9315(c).  Second, \xc2\xa736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of the Act imposed upon investment advisers a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to compensation received from a mutual fund, 15 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b), and granted individual investors a private right of action for breach of that duty, <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty\xe2\x80\x9d standard contained in \xc2\xa736(b) represented a delicate compromise.  Prior to the adoption of the 1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment adviser fees under state law were required to meet \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an unreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the court deemed it \xe2\x80\x98unconscionable\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98shocking,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csecurity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Investment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross abuse of trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, 464 U. S., at 540, n.\xc2\xa012.  Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the SEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the Commission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was not \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d and to intervene in any similar action brought by or on behalf of an investment company.  <em>Id.,</em> at  538.  This approach was included in a bill that passed the House.  H.\xe2\x80\x82R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa78(d) (1967); see also S. 1659, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \xc2\xa78(d) (1967).  Industry representatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing that it \xe2\x80\x9cmight in essence provide the Commission with ratemaking authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, 464 U. S., at 538.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted \xe2\x80\x9ca different method of testing management compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 539 (quoting S.\xe2\x80\x82Rep., at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted)), that was more favorable to shareholders than the previously available remedies but that did not permit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is the fiduciary duty standard in \xc2\xa736(b).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual funds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P., an investment adviser.  Petitioners filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to \xc2\xa736(b) seeking damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agreements between Harris Associates and the mutual funds.  The complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated \xc2\xa736(b) by charging fees that were \xe2\x80\x9cdisproportionate to the services rendered\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 52.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment for Harris Associates.  Applying the standard adopted in <em>Gartenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.</em>, 694 F.\xc2\xa02d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the fees charged \xe2\x80\xa6 were so disproportionately large that they could not have been the result of arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a.  The District Court assumed that it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with those that Harris Associates charged its other clients.  <em>Id.,</em> at 30a.  But in light of those comparisons as well as comparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to similar mutual funds, the Court held that it could not reasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside the range that could have been the product of arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining.  <em>Id.,</em> at 29a\xe2\x80\x9332a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on different reasoning, explicitly \xe2\x80\x9cdisapprov[ing] the <em>Gartenberg </em>approach.\xe2\x80\x9d 527 F.\xc2\xa03d 627, 632 (2008).  Looking to trust law, the panel noted that, while a trustee \xe2\x80\x9cowes an obligation of candor in negotiation,\xe2\x80\x9d a trustee, at the time of the creation of a trust, \xe2\x80\x9cmay negotiate in his own interest and accept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7242, and Comment <em>f</em>)).  The panel thus reasoned that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] fiduciary duty differs from rate regulation.  A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em> 527 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 632.  In the panel\xe2\x80\x99s view, the amount of an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s compensation would be relevant only if the compensation were \xe2\x80\x9cso unusual\xe2\x80\x9d as to give rise to an inference \xe2\x80\x9cthat deceit must have occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision have abdicated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The panel argued that this understanding of \xc2\xa736(b) is consistent with the forces operating in the contemporary mutual fund market.  Noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]oday thousands of mutual funds compete,\xe2\x80\x9d the panel concluded that \xe2\x80\x9csophisticated investors\xe2\x80\x9d shop for the funds that produce the best overall results, \xe2\x80\x9cmov[e] their money elsewhere\xe2\x80\x9d when fees are \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive in relation to the results,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a competitive pressure\xe2\x80\x9d that generally keeps fees low.  <em>Id.,</em> at 633\xe2\x80\x93634.  The panel faulted <em>Gartenberg</em> on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9crelies too little on markets.\xe2\x80\x9d  527 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 632.  And the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the fees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the fees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients, observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ifferent clients call for different commitments of time\xe2\x80\x9d and that costs, such as research, that may benefit several categories of clients \xe2\x80\x9cmake it hard to draw inferences from fee levels.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 634.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote.  537 F.\xc2\xa03d 728 (2008).  The dissent from the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of <em>Gartenberg</em> was based \xe2\x80\x9cmainly on an economic analysis that is ripe for reexamination.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 F.\xe2\x80\x823d, at 730 (opinion of Posner, J.).  Among other things, the dissent expressed concern that Harris Associates charged \xe2\x80\x9cits captive funds more than twice what it charges independent funds,\xe2\x80\x9d and the dissent questioned whether high adviser fees actually drive investors away.  <em>Id.,</em> at 731.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under \xc2\xa736(b).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  556 U.

As noted, the Seventh Circuit panel thought that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty\xe2\x80\x9d incorporates a standard taken from the law of trusts.  Petitioners agree but maintain that the panel identified the wrong trust-law standard.  Instead of the standard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negotiate the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fee at the time of the creation of a trust, petitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trustee seeks compensation after the trust is created.

Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the term \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary\xe2\x80\x9d is not exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means different things in different contexts, and that there is no reason to believe that \xc2\xa736(b) incorporates the specific meaning of the term in the law of trusts.

In <em>Pepper </em>v.<em> Litton</em>, 308 U.\xe2\x80\x82S. 295 (1939), we discussed the meaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that is analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to trust law.  At issue in <em>Pepper </em>was whether a bankruptcy court could disallow a dominant or controlling shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corporation.  Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciar[ies]\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 306.  We then explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or engagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the director or stockholder not only to prove the good faith of the transaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. <em>The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length bargain.</em>  If it does not, equity will set it aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 306\xe2\x80\x93307 (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see also <em>Geddes</em> v. <em>Anaconda Copper Mining Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/254/590/index.html">254 U. S. 590</a>, 599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary duty for interested directors).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa736(b), 84 Stat. 1429.  The Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a significant way: it shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming breach, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(1), to show that the fee is outside the range that arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining would produce.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Gartenberg</em> approach fully incorporates this understanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in <em>Pepper </em>and reflects \xc2\xa736(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of the burden on the plaintiff.  As noted, <em>Gartenberg</em> insists that all relevant circumstances be taken into account, see 694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 929, as does \xc2\xa736(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]pproval by the board of directors \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be given such consideration by the court as is deemed appropriate under <em>all the circumstances</em>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).

S., at 482.  The Act interposes disinterested directors as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent watchdogs\xe2\x80\x9d of the relationship between a mutual fund and its adviser.  <em>Id.,</em> at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To provide these directors with the information needed to judge whether an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s compensation is excessive, the Act requires advisers to furnish all information \xe2\x80\x9creasonably \xe2\x80\xa6 necessary to evaluate the terms\xe2\x80\x9d of the adviser\xe2\x80\x99s contract, 15 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9315(c), and gives the SEC the authority to enforce that requirement.  See \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9341.  Board scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder suits under \xc2\xa736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts.  See<em> Daily Income Fund</em>, 464 U. S., at 541 (Congress intended for \xc2\xa736(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser contracts to act as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent checks on excessive fees\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kamen</em>, 500 U.

Cf.<em> Burks,</em> 441 U.

First, a measure of deference to a board\xe2\x80\x99s judgment may be appropriate in some instances.  Second, the appropriate measure of deference varies depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gartenberg</em> heeds these precepts.  <em>Gartenberg</em> advises that \xe2\x80\x9cthe expertise of the independent trustees of a fund, whether they are fully informed about all facts bearing on the [investment adviser\xe2\x80\x99s] service and fee, and the extent of care and conscientiousness with which they perform their duties are important factors to be considered in deciding whether they and the [investment adviser] are guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of \xc2\xa736(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  694 F.\xe2\x80\x822d, at 930.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While both parties in this case endorse the basic <em>Gartenberg </em>approach, they disagree on several important questions that warrant discussion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first concerns comparisons between the fees that an adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees that it charges its independent clients.  As noted, the <em>Gartenberg</em> court rejected a comparison between the fees that the adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the fees that it charged a pension fund.  694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 930, n.\xc2\xa03 (noting the \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he nature and extent of the services required by each type of fund differ sharply\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioners contend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for Petitioners 30\xe2\x80\x9331, but respondent disagrees.  Brief for Respondent 38\xe2\x80\x9344.  Since the Act requires consideration of all relevant factors, 15 U.\xe2\x80\x82S.\xe2\x80\x82C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(2); see also \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9315(c), we do not think that there can be any categorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged different types of clients.  See<em> Daily Income Fund, supra</em>, at 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers\xe2\x80\x99 practice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to their other clients).  Instead, courts may give such comparisons the weight that they merit in light of the similarities and differences between the services that the clients in question require, but courts must be wary of inapt comparisons.  As the panel below noted, there may be significant differences between the services provided by an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it provides to a pension fund which are attributable to the greater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher marketing costs.  527 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 634 (\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent clients call for different commitments of time\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the services rendered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not probative, then courts must reject such a comparison.  Even if the services provided and fees charged to an independent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between mutual funds and institutional clients contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contentions.  See <em>id.,</em> at 631.  (\xe2\x80\x9cPlaintiffs maintain that a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more than its independent clients\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the same token, courts should not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other advisers.  These comparisons are problematic because these fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations conducted at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length.  See<em> </em>537 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 731\xe2\x80\x93732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); <em>Gartenberg, supra</em>, at 929 (\xe2\x80\x9cCompetition between money market funds for shareholder business does not support an inference that competition must therefore also exist between [investment advisers] for fund business.  The former may be vigorous even though the latter is virtually non-existent\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, a court\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of an investment adviser\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(2) (requiring deference to board\xe2\x80\x99s consideration \xe2\x80\x9cas is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, 464 U. S., at 541 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended security holder and SEC actions under \xc2\xa736(b), on the one hand, and directorial approval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as independent checks on excessive fees\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where a board\xe2\x80\x99s process for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser compensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford commensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining process.  See<em> Burks,</em> 441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated directors serve as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent watchdogs\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, if the disinterested directors considered the relevant factors, their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even if a court might weigh the factors differently.  Cf<em>. id.,</em> at 485.  This is not to deny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated by a board in possession of all relevant information, but such a determination must be based on evidence that the fee \xe2\x80\x9cis so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gartenberg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 928.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, where the board\xe2\x80\x99s process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome.  When an investment adviser fails to disclose material information to the board, greater scrutiny is justified because the withheld information might have hampered the board\xe2\x80\x99s ability to function as \xe2\x80\x9can independent check upon the management.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Burks</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cSection 36(b) is sharply focused on the question of whether the fees themselves were excessive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Migdal</em> v. <em>Rowe Price-Fleming Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., </em>248 F.\xc2\xa03d 321, 328 (CA4 2001); see also<em> </em>15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b) (imposing a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary duty with respect to the <em>receipt of compensation </em>for services<em>, </em>or of payments of a material natur<em>e</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  But an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s compliance or noncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that must be considered in calibrating the degree of deference that is due a board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s fees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also important to note that the standard for fiduciary breach under \xc2\xa736(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions.  See <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 538; see also <em>Burks</em>, 441 U. S., at 483 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress consciously chose to address the conflict-of-interest problem through the Act\xe2\x80\x99s independent-directors section, rather than through more drastic remedies\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some restraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinterested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transactions with the investment adviser,\xe2\x80\x9d but they do not suggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disinterested directors apprised of all relevant information, without additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length range.  <em>Id.</em>, at 481.  In reviewing compensation under \xc2\xa736(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in a precise calculation of fees representative of arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining.  See<em> </em>527 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 633 (\xe2\x80\x9cJudicial price-setting does not accompany fiduciary duties\xe2\x80\x9d).  As recounted above, Congress rejected a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting responsibilities.  See <em>Daily Income Fund</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 538\xe2\x80\x93540.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 approach recognizes that courts are not well suited to make such precise calculations.

A money market fund often invests in short-term money market securities, such as short-term securities of the United States Government or its agencies, bank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper.  Investors can invest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the fund resembles an investment \xe2\x80\x9cmore like a bank account than [a] traditional investment in securities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 925.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 36 (b) provides as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by such registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof, to such investment adviser.\xe2\x80\x9d  84 Stat. 1429 (codified at 15 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b), that courts have applied since (and in certain respects in spite of) <em>Gartenberg</em> v. <em>Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.</em>, 694 F.\xc2\xa02d 923, 928\xe2\x80\x93930 (CA2 1982).  I write separately because I would not shortchange the Court\xe2\x80\x99s effort by describing it as affirmation of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Gartenberg</em> standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7, 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court and Court of Appeals in <em>Gartenberg</em> created that standard, which emphasizes fee \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d and proportionality, 694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 929, in a manner that could be read to permit the equivalent of the judicial rate regulation the <em>Gartenberg</em> opinions disclaim, based on the Investment Company Act of 1940\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctortuous\xe2\x80\x9d legislative history and a handful of extrastatutory policy and market considerations, <em>id.</em>, at 928; see also <em>id</em>., at 926\xe2\x80\x93927, 929\xe2\x80\x93931; <em>Gartenberg</em> v. <em>Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc</em>., 528 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1038, 1046\xe2\x80\x931050, 1055\xe2\x80\x931057 (SDNY 1981).  Although virtually all subsequent \xc2\xa736(b) cases cite<em> Gartenberg</em>, most courts have correctly declined its invitation to stray beyond statutory bounds.  Instead, they have followed an approach (principally in deciding which cases may proceed past summary judgment) that defers to the informed conclusions of disinterested boards and holds plaintiffs to their heavy burden of proof in the manner the Act, and now the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, requires.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 11 (underscoring that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cmodifies\xe2\x80\x9d the governing fiduciary duty standard \xe2\x80\x9cin a significant way: It shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa780a\xe2\x80\x9335(b)(1), to show that the fee is outside the range that arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length bargaining would produce\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>16 (citing the \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of deference that is due a board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve an adviser\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x9d and admonishing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe standard for fiduciary breach under \xc2\xa736(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to affirm this approach based upon the Investment Company Act\xe2\x80\x99s text and our longstanding fiduciary duty precedents.  But I would not say that in doing so we endorse the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Gartenberg</em> standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whatever else might be said about today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, it does not countenance the free-ranging judicial \xe2\x80\x9cfairness\xe2\x80\x9d review of fees that <em>Gartenberg</em> could be read to authorize, see 694 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 929\xe2\x80\x93930, and that virtually all courts deciding \xc2\xa736(b) cases since <em>Gartenberg</em> (including the Court of Appeals in this case) have wisely eschewed in the post <em>Gartenberg</em> precedents we approve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
