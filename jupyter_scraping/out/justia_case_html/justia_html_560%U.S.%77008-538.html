REILLY</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x93538.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 3, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 17, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering business failed.  She supported her petition with, <em>inter alia,</em> Schedule B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt.  Her Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718.  On Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness equipment\xe2\x80\x9d: a \xe2\x80\x9ctool[s] of the trade\xe2\x80\x9d exemption for the statutory-maximum \xe2\x80\x9c$1,850 in value,\xe2\x80\x9d 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7522(d)(6); and $8,868 under the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or \xe2\x80\x9cwildcard,\xe2\x80\x9d exemptions up to $10,225 in value.  The claimed exemptions\xe2\x80\x99 total value ($10,718) equaled Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s market value.  Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy estate \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d objects, \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), within a certain 30-day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).  Absent an objection, the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s value exceeds what the Code permits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>); <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/638/index.html">503 U. S. 638</a>, 642\xe2\x80\x93643.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although an appraisal revealed that the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s total market value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bankruptcy estate\xe2\x80\x99s trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions because the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6).  Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718 she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining value to her creditors.  Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s full value, even if it turned out to be more than the amounts she declared and that the Code allowed.  She asserted that the estate had forfeited its claim to any portion of that value because Schwab had not objected within the Rule 4003(b) period, and that she would dismiss her petition rather than sell her equipment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court denied Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s motion and Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s conditional motion to dismiss.  The District Court denied Schwab relief, rejecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the debtor declares as the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s value is within the limits the Code prescribes.  Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s full value.  Relying on <em>Taylor, </em>it held that Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object entitled Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code permitted.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because Reilly gave \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of [her] claimed exemption[s]\xe2\x80\x9d on Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what it defines as the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d Schwab was not required to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estate\xe2\x80\x99s right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the exempt interest.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s complicated view of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s statutory obligation, and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The parties agree that this case is governed by \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), which states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \xe2\x80\x9cfile a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reilly asserts that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d refers to all of the information on Schedule C, including the estimated market value of each asset.  Schwab and <em>amicus </em>United States counter that because the Code defines such property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular asset, <em>not</em> as the asset itself, the value of the property claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor assigns the interest, <em>not</em> on the value the debtor assigns the asset.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Schwab and the United States are correct.  The portion of \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt\xe2\x80\x9d unless an interested party objects.  Rather, it is the portion that defines the objection\xe2\x80\x99s target, namely, the \xe2\x80\x9clist of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 522(b) does <em>not </em>define the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to the estimated market value.  It refers only to property defined in \xc2\xa7522(d), which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as exempt.  Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here define \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d as the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94up to a specified dollar amount\xe2\x80\x94in the assets described in the category, <em>not</em> as the assets themselves.  Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly claimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the Code allows.  Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the target of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s objection based on Schedule C\xe2\x80\x99s language and dictionary definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d at odds with the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  The Third Circuit failed to account for the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or in full regardless of value.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(d)(9).  Schwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions\xe2\x80\x99 propriety based on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of claimed exemption.\xe2\x80\x9d  This conclusion does not render Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s market value estimate superfluous.  It simply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may have value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose full value may not be available for exemption.  This interpretation is consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Taylor</em> does not dictate a contrary conclusion.  While both <em>Taylor </em>and this case concern the consequences of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003\xe2\x80\x99s time period, <em>Taylor </em>establishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount the debtor lists as the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue claimed exempt\xe2\x80\x9d is not within statutory limits.  In <em>Taylor, </em>the value listed in Schedule C (\xe2\x80\x9c$ unknown\xe2\x80\x9d) was not plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and $1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag present in <em>Taylor</em>.  Departing from <em>Taylor</em> would not only ignore the presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law; it would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d and the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating an exemption\xe2\x80\x99s validity.  Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.  Basing the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus an interested party\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to object under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), on inferences that party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor assigns the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the Code, would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to provide.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s argument threatens to convert the Code\xe2\x80\x99s goal of giving debtors a fresh start into a free pass.  By permitting a debtor \xe2\x80\x9cto withdraw from the estate certain interests in property, \xe2\x80\xa6 up to certain values,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rousey</em> v. <em>Jacoway</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/320/index.html">544 U. S. 320</a>, 325, Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors.  This Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an exemption\xe2\x80\x99s validity under the Code.  In rejecting Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on their rights.  The decision reached here encourages a debtor wishing to exempt an asset\xe2\x80\x99s full market value or the asset itself to declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its scope clear.  Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond relevant statutory limits.  If the trustee fails to object, or his objection is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the asset\xe2\x80\x99s full value.  If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allowance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to permit the exemption.  See Rule 1009(a).  Either result will facilitate the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s finality and clouded-title concerns.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7541, subject to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s right to reclaim certain property as \xe2\x80\x9cexempt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).  The Bankruptcy Code specifies the types of property debtors may exempt, \xc2\xa7522(b), as well as the maximum value of the exemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets, \xc2\xa7522(d).  Property a debtor claims as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy estate \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d objects.  \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case presents an opportunity for us to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what constitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested party must object under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).  The issue is whether an interested party must object to a claimed exemption where, as here, the Code defines the property the debtor is authorized to exempt as an interest, the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular type of asset, and the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s schedule of exempt property accurately describes the asset and declares the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d in that asset to be an amount within the limits that the Code prescribes.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinafter Schedule C).  We hold that, in cases such as this, an interested party need not object to an exemption claimed in this manner in order to preserve the estate\xe2\x80\x99s ability to recover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the debtor expressly declared exempt.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering business failed.  She supported her petition with various schedules and statements, two of which are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bankruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of which become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on which the Rules require debtors to list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt.  The assets Reilly listed on Schedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other kitchen equipment that she described as \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d and to which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718.  App. 40a, 49a\xe2\x80\x9355a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in  this equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code.  Reilly claimed a \xe2\x80\x9ctool[s] of the trade\xe2\x80\x9d exemption of $1,850 in the equipment under \xc2\xa7522(d)(6), which permits a debtor to exempt his \xe2\x80\x9caggregate interest, not to exceed $1,850 in value, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of [his] trade.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table).  And she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in the equipment under \xc2\xa7522(d)(5), which, at the time she filed for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a \xe2\x80\x9cwildcard\xe2\x80\x9d exemption equal to the \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate interest in any property, not to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d $10,225 \xe2\x80\x9cin value.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See App. 58a.  The total value of these claimed exemptions ($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on Schedules B and C as the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s estimated market value, see <em>id.</em>, at 49a, 58a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties to object to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemptions within 30 days after the conclusion of the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 meeting held pursuant to Rule 2003(a).  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).  If an interested party fails to object within the time allowed, a claimed exemption will exclude the subject property from the estate even if the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s value exceeds what the Code permits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>); <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/638/index.html">503 U. S. 638</a>, 642\xe2\x80\x93643 (1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemptions in her business equipment because the dollar value Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe.  App. 163a.  But because an appraisal revealed that the total market value of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718 she claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s creditors.  App. 141a\xe2\x80\x93143a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reilly opposed Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  She argued that by equating on Schedule C the total value of the exemptions she claimed in the equipment with the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s full value, even if that amount turned out to be more than the dollar amount she declared, and more than the Code allowed.  <em>Id</em>., at 165a.  Citing \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), Reilly asserted that  because her Schedule C notified Schwab of her intent to  exempt the full value of her business equipment, he was obliged to object if he wished to preserve the estate\xe2\x80\x99s right to retain any value in the equipment in excess of the $10,718 she estimated.  Because Schwab did not object within the time prescribed by Rule 4003(b), Reilly asserted that the estate forfeited its claim to such value.  <em>Id</em>., at 165a.  Reilly further informed the Bankruptcy Court that exempting her business equipment from the estate was so important to her that she would dismiss her bankruptcy case if doing so was the only way to avoid the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s sale at auction.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court denied both Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s motion to auction the equipment and Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s conditional motion to dismiss her case.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Reilly</em>, 403 B.\xc2\xa0R. 336 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MD Pa. 2006).  Schwab sought relief from the District Court, arguing that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the debtor declares as the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of [the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d in certain property is an amount within the limits the Code prescribes.  The District Court rejected Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s argument, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Reilly</em>, 534 F.\xc2\xa03d 173 (CA3 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her exemptions in her business equipment with the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s market value, Reilly \xe2\x80\x9cindicate[d] the intent\xe2\x80\x9d to exempt the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s full value.  <em>Id.</em>, at 174.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in <em>Taylor:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e believe this case to be controlled by Taylor</em>.  Just as we perceive it was important to the <em>Taylor</em> Court that the debtor meant to exempt the full amount of the property by listing \xe2\x80\x98unknown\xe2\x80\x99 as both the value of the property and the value of the exemption, it is important to us that Reilly valued the business equipment at $10,718 and claimed an exemption in the same amount.

See 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  We conclude that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach fails to account for the text of the relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our decision in<em> Taylor</em>.  Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The starting point for our analysis is the proper interpretation of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C.  If we read the Schedule Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s way, she claimed exemptions in her business equipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus claimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected if he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the estate.  If we read Schedule C Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s way, Reilly claimed valid exemptions to which Schwab had no duty to object.  The Court of Appeals construed Schedule C Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s way and interpreted her claimed exemptions as improper, and therefore objectionable, even though their declared value was facially within the applicable Code limits.  In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that trustees evaluating the validity of exemptions in cases like this cannot take a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s claim at face value, and specifically cannot rely on the fact that the amount the debtor declares as the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d is within statutory limits.  Instead, the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s duty to object turns on whether the interplay of various schedule entries supports an inference that the debtor \xe2\x80\x9cintended\xe2\x80\x9d to exempt a dollar value different than the one she wrote on the form.  534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  This complicated view of the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s statutory obligation, and the strained reading of Schedule C on which it rests, is inconsistent with the Code.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties agree that this case is governed by \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), which states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \xe2\x80\x9cfile a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,\xe2\x80\x9d and further states that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  The parties further agree that the \xe2\x80\x9clist\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) refers is the \xe2\x80\x9clist of property \xe2\x80\xa6 claim[ed] as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d currently known as \xe2\x80\x9cSchedule C.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Schedule C.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The parties, like the Courts of Appeals, disagree about what information on Schedule C defines the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of evaluating an exemption\xe2\x80\x99s propriety under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).  Reilly asserts that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by reference to all the information on Schedule C, including the estimated market value of each asset in which the debtor claims an exempt interest.  Schwab and the United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> argue that the Code specifically defines the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as an interest, the value of which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular asset, <em>not</em> as the asset itself.  Accordingly, they argue that the value of the property claimed exempt, <em>i.e</em>., the value of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s exempt interest in the asset, should be judged on the value the debtor assigns the interest, <em>not</em> on the value the debtor assigns the asset.  The point of disagreement is best illustrated by the relevant portion of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C:</p>\n<p align="left">Schedule C\xe2\x80\x93Property Claimed as Exempt</p>\n<p align="left"><left>Description of </left></p>\n<p>\n\nProperty<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nSpecify Law Providing Each Exemption<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nValue of Claimed Exemption<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nCurrent Market Value of Property Without Deducting Exemptions<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nSchedule B Personal<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nProperty<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\n. . . . <left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nSee attached list of business equipment.<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\n. . . . <left></left></p>\n<p>\n\n11 U.

See Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9328.  Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that where, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her claimed exemptions in a certain asset (column three) with her estimate of the asset\xe2\x80\x99s market value (column four), she establishes the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as the full value of the asset, whatever that turns out to be.  See<em> ibid</em>.  Accordingly, Reilly argues that her Schedule C clearly put Schwab on notice that she \xe2\x80\x9cintended\xe2\x80\x9d to claim an exemption for the full value of her business equipment, and that Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s failure to oppose the exemption in a timely manner placed the full value of the equipment outside the estate\xe2\x80\x99s reach<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schwab does not dispute that columns three and four apprised him that Reilly equated the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment ($1,850 plus $8,868) with the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s market value ($10,718).  He simply disagrees with Reilly that this \xe2\x80\x9cidentical listing put [him] on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property fully,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless whether its value exceeded the exemption limits the Code prescribes.  534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  Schwab and amicus </em>United States instead contend that the Code defines the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d Reilly claimed as exempt under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d whose value cannot exceed a certain dollar amount.

Construing Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C in light of this statutory definition, they contend that Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e</em>., two interests in her business equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respectively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude from her estate under the Code provisions she referenced in column 2.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8 (citing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6)).  Accordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude that Schwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in order to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly properly claimed as exempt.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree.  The portion of \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt\xe2\x80\x9d unless an interested party objects.  Rather, it is the portion of \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) that defines the target of the objection, namely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object to the \xe2\x80\x9clist of property that the debtor claims as exempt <em>under subsection (b)</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  That subsection, \xc2\xa7522(b), does <em>not </em>define the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d by reference to the estimated market value on which Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely.  Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9323;<em> </em>534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  Section 522(b)  refers only to property defined in \xc2\xa7522(d), which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as exempt.  As we have recognized, most of these categories (and all of the categories applicable to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions) define the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d a debtor may \xe2\x80\x9cclai[m] as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94up to a specified dollar amount\xe2\x80\x94in the assets described in the category, <em>not</em> as the assets themselves.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5)\xe2\x80\x93(6); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(4), (8); <em>Rousey</em> v. <em>Jacoway</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/320/index.html">544 U.

Viewing Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s form entries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab and the United States that Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in her business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because the stated value of each interest, and thus of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d was within the limits the Code allows.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view of Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the target of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s objection\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94based on language in Schedule C and dictionary definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d see Brief for Respondent 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 40\xe2\x80\x9341, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Although we may look to dictionaries and the Bankruptcy Rules to determine the meaning of words the Code does not define, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rousey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 330, the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d in this case is clear.  As noted above, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6) define the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d in Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment, <em>not</em> as the equipment <em>per se</em>.  Sections 522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to exempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and thus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is below a particular dollar amount.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  That is the case here, and Schwab was entitled to rely upon these provisions in evaluating whether Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions were objectionable under the Code.  See <em>Lamie</em> v. <em>United States Trustee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/526/index.html">540 U. S. 526</a>, 534 (2004); <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/1/index.html">530 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (2000).  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 contrary holding not only fails to account for the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  It also fails to account for the provisions in \xc2\xa7522(d) that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or in full regardless of value.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(9) (professionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability benefits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts).  We decline to construe Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemptions in a manner that elides the distinction between these provisions and provisions such as \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6), see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001), particularly based upon an entry on Schedule C\xe2\x80\x94Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of her equipment\xe2\x80\x99s market value\xe2\x80\x94to which the Code does not refer in defining the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all of these reasons, we conclude that Schwab was entitled to evaluate the propriety of the claimed exemptions based on three, and only three, entries on Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C: the description of the business equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of claimed exemption.\xe2\x80\x9d  In reaching this conclusion, we do not render the market value estimate on Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C superfluous.  We simply confine the estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may have value beyond the dollar amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose full value may not be available for exemption because a portion of the interest is, for example, encumbered by an unavoidable lien.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice \xc2\xa756:7 (3d ed. 2009); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16; Dept. of Justice, Executive Office for U. S. Trustees, Handbook for Chapter 7 Trustees, p. 8\xe2\x80\x931 (2005), http://\nwww.justice.gov\xc2\xa0/ust/eo/private_trustee/library/chapter07/\ndocs/7handbook1008/Ch7_Handbook.pdf (as visited June 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  As noted, most assets become property of the estate upon commencement of a bankruptcy case, see 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7541, and exemptions represent the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to reclaim those assets or, more often, certain interests in those assets, to the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 detriment.  Accordingly, it is at least useful for a trustee to be able to compare the value of the claimed exemption (which typically represents the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a particular asset) with the asset\xe2\x80\x99s estimated market value (which belongs to the estate subject to any valid exemption) without having to consult separate schedules.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation of Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s statutory obligations is not only consistent with the governing Code provisions; it is also consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.  Congress has permitted debtors to exempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for more than two centuries.  See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19, \xc2\xa75, 2 Stat. 23.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Throughout these periods, debtors have validly exempted property based on forms that required the debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without also estimating the market value of the asset in which the debtor claimed the exempt interest.  See Brief for Respondent 46, n.\xc2\xa07 (citing Sup. Ct. Bkrtcy. Form 20 (1877)).[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Indeed, it was not until 1991 that Schedule B\xe2\x80\x934 was redesignated as Schedule C and amended to require the estimate of market value on which Reilly so heavily relies.  See Schedule C.  This amendment was not occasioned by legislative changes that altered the Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cthe property claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d in this case as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest,\xe2\x80\x9d not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Accordingly, we agree with Schwab and the United States that this recent amendment to the exemption form does not compel Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s view of Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s statutory obligations, or render the claimed exemptions in this case objectionable under the Code.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 9\xe2\x80\x9311; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9317.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals erred in holding that our decision in <em>Taylor</em> dictates a contrary conclusion.  See 534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  <em>Taylor</em> does not rest on what the debtor \xe2\x80\x9cmeant\xe2\x80\x9d to exempt.  534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  Rather, <em>Taylor</em> applies to the face of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemption the Code provisions that compel reversal here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The debtor in <em>Taylor</em>, like the debtor here, filed a schedule of exemptions with the Bankruptcy Court on which the debtor described the property subject to the claimed exemption, identified the Code provision supporting the exemption, and listed the dollar value of the exemption.  Critically, however, the debtor in <em>Taylor</em> did <em>not</em>, like the debtor here, state the value of the claimed exemption as a specific dollar amount at or below the limits the Code allows.  Instead, the debtor in <em>Taylor</em> listed the value of the exemption itself as \xe2\x80\x9c$ <em>unknown</em>\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">Schedule B-4.\xe2\x80\x93Property Claimed Exempt</p>\n<p align="left"><left>Type of Property</left></p>\n<p>\n\nLocation, Description, and, So Far As Relevant to the Claim of Exemption, Present Use of Property<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nSpecify the Statute Creating the Exemption<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nValue Claimed Exempt<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nProceeds from lawsuit<left></left></p>\n<p>\n\nWinn v.

See<em> </em>503 U. S., at 642.  Accordingly, although this case and <em>Taylor </em>both concern the consequences of a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object to a claimed exemption within the time specified by Rule 4003, the question arose in <em>Taylor</em> on starkly different facts.  In <em>Taylor</em>, the question concerned a trustee\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to object to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s entry of a \xe2\x80\x9cvalue claimed exempt\xe2\x80\x9d that was <em>not</em> plainly within the limits the Code allows.  In this case, the opposite is true.  The amounts Reilly listed in the Schedule C column titled \xe2\x80\x9cValue of Claimed Exemption\xe2\x80\x9d <em>are</em> facially within the limits the Code prescribes and raise no warning flags that warranted an objection.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  See <em>supra,</em> at 8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Taylor </em>supports this conclusion.  In holding otherwise, the Court of Appeals focused on what it described as <em>Taylor\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unstated premise\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a debtor who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is claiming the \xe2\x80\x9cfull amount,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever it turns out to be.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 179.  But <em>Taylor</em> does not rest on this premise.  It establishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount the debtor lists as the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue claimed exempt\xe2\x80\x9d is not within statutory limits, a test the value ($ <em>unknown</em>) in <em>Taylor</em> failed, and the values ($8,868 and $1,850) in this case pass.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We adhere to this test.  Doing otherwise would not only depart from <em>Taylor</em> and ignore the presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Budd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/144/154/index.html">144 U. S. 154</a>, 163 (1892); it would also require us to expand the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d and the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a claimed exemption.  Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.  As evidenced by the differences between Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C and the schedule in <em>Taylor</em>, preprinted bankruptcy schedules change over time.  Basing the definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus an interested party\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to object under \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), on inferences that party must draw from evolving forms, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor assigns the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the Code, would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to provide.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  For all of these reasons, we take Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions at face value and find them unobjectionable under the Code, so the objection deadline we enforced in <em>Taylor</em> is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a final effort to defend the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, Reilly asserts that her approach to \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) is necessary to vindicate the Code\xe2\x80\x99s goal of giving debtors a fresh start, and to further its policy of discouraging trustees and creditors from sleeping on their rights.  See Brief for Respondent 21, 55\xe2\x80\x9368.  Although none of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments can overcome the Code provisions or the aspects of <em>Taylor</em> that govern this case, our decision fully accords with all of the policies she identifies.  We agree that \xe2\x80\x9cexemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel of the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a \xe2\x80\x98fresh start.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting <em>Rousey</em>, 544 U.

We disagree that this policy required Schwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on pain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment beyond the value of the interest she declared exempt.  This approach threatens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we emphasized in <em>Rousey</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o help the debtor obtain a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to <em>withdraw from the estate</em> certain <em>interests in</em> property, such as his car or home, <em>up to certain values</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d 544 U. S., at 325 (emphasis added).  The Code limits exemptions in this fashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available to his creditors.  See \xc2\xa7522(b)(1).  Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors, and it is not for us to alter this balance by requiring trustees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those that govern an exemption\xe2\x80\x99s validity under the Code.  See <em>Lamie</em>, 540 U. S., at 534, 538; <em>Hartford</em>, 530 U. S., at 6; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Locke</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/84/index.html">471 U.

See Brief for Respondent 64, n.\xc2\xa010, 67\xe2\x80\x9369.  Again, we disagree.  Where a debtor intends to exempt nothing more than an interest worth a specified dollar amount in an asset that is not subject to an unlimited or in-kind exemption under the Code, our approach will ensure clear and efficient resolution of competing claims to the asset\xe2\x80\x99s value.  If an interested party does not object to the claimed interest by the time the Rule 4003 period expires, title to the asset will remain with the estate pursuant to \xc2\xa7541, and the debtor will be guaranteed a payment in the dollar amount of the exemption.  If an interested party timely objects, the court will rule on the objection and, if it is improper, allow the debtor to make appropriate adjustments.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where, as here, it is important to the debtor to exempt the full market value of the asset or the asset itself, our decision will encourage the debtor to declare the value of her claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope of the exemption clear, for example, by listing the exempt value as \xe2\x80\x9cfull fair market value (FMV)\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c100% of FMV.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Such a declaration will encourage the trustee to object promptly to the exemption if he wishes to challenge it and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond relevant statutory limits.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  If the trustee fails to object, or if the trustee objects and the objection is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the full value of the asset.  If the trustee objects and the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the portion of the exemption that exceeds the statutory allowance, or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with her creditors to permit the exemption.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 1009(a).  Either result will facilitate the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the debtor (and the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s creditors) to achieve a fresh start free of the finality and clouded-title concerns Reilly describes.  See Brief for Respondent 57\xe2\x80\x9359 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder [Schwab\xe2\x80\x99s] interpretation of Rule 4003(b), a debtor would never have the certainty of knowing whether or not he or she may keep her exempted property until the case had ended\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 66.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all of these reasons, the policy considerations Reilly cites support our approach.  Where, as here, a debtor accurately describes an asset subject to an exempt interest and on Schedule C declares the \xe2\x80\x9cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d as a dollar amount within the range the Code allows, interested parties are entitled to rely upon that value as evidence of the claim\xe2\x80\x99s validity.  Accordingly, we hold that Schwab was not required to object to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claimed exemptions in her business equipment in order to preserve the estate\xe2\x80\x99s right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the exempt interest.  In reaching this conclusion, we express no judgment on the merits of, and do not foreclose the courts from entertaining on remand, procedural or other measures that may allow Reilly to avoid auction of her business equipment.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The 1994 version of 11 U.

The dissent insists that \xe2\x80\x9ca debtor\xe2\x80\x99s market valuation [of the equipment in which she claims an exempt interest] is an essential factor in determining the nature of the \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99 [the] debtor lists as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus in determining whether the claimed exemption is objectionable), because \xe2\x80\x9cwithout comparing [the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d the trustee \xe2\x80\x9ccould not comprehend whether [the debtor] claimed a monetary or an in-kind \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99 in [the] equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa09.  This argument overlooks the fact that there is another way the trustee could discern from the \xe2\x80\x9cface of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s filings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa06, whether the debtor claimed as exempt a \xe2\x80\x9cmonetary or an in-kind \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99 in\xe2\x80\x9d her equipment, <em>post</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa09: The trustee could simply consult the Code provisions the debtor listed as governing the exemption in question.  Here, those provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (d)(6), expressly describe the exempt interest as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a specified dollar amount.  Accordingly, it was entirely appropriate for Schwab to view Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s schedule entries as exempting an interest in her business equipment in the (declared and unobjectionable) amounts of $1,850 and $8,868.  Viewing the entries otherwise, <em>i.e.</em>, as exempting the equipment in kind or in full no matter what its dollar value, would unnecessarily treat the exemption as violating the limits imposed by the Code provisions that govern it, as well as ignore the distinction between those provisions and the provisions that \xe2\x80\x9cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the property in full without any cap on value,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa05.  And it would do all of this based on information (identical dollar amounts in columns three and four of Schedule C) that Schwab and one of his <em>amici</em> say often result from a default setting in commercial bankruptcy software.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 15; Brief for Nat. Assn. of Bankruptcy Trustees 13, n.\xc2\xa015.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the estimate plays a greater role, and is \xe2\x80\x9cvital,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> post</em>, at 8, to determining whether the value a debtor assigns the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d (here, an interest in certain business equipment) is objectionable, see <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, lacks statutory support because the governing Code provisions phrase the exemption limit as a simple dollar amount.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, see<em> post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x93&gt;9, might be plausible if the Code stated that the debtor could exempt an interest in her equipment \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a certain <em>percentage</em> of the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s market value, because then it might be necessary to \xe2\x80\x9ccompar[e] [the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d to determine the exemption\xe2\x80\x99s propriety.  <em>Post</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa09.  But the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms.  Moreover, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent relies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset\xe2\x80\x99s full value, the dissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from relying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries.  According to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should assume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she believes to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to exempt an interest \xe2\x80\x9cnot to exceed\xe2\x80\x9d a certain dollar amount, <em>e.g.</em>, \xc2\xa7522(d)(6), but <em>also</em> that the debtor would continue to claim the asset\xe2\x80\x99s full value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point that would cause her claim to violate the Code.  The schedule entries themselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions they invoke undercut it.  The evidence that the debtor in this case would have chosen that course is external to her exemption schedule.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 4 (citing statements in Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss); <em>post</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa03, 6 (same).  And in the ordinary case, particularly if the equivalent entries the dissent relies upon result from a software default, see n.\xc2\xa010, <em>supra,</em> there is no reason to assume that a debtor would want to violate the Code or jeopardize other exemptions if her market value estimate turns out to be wrong.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See also Act of Aug. 19, 1841, ch. 9, \xc2\xa73, 5 Stat. 442; Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch.\xc2\xa0176, \xc2\xa711, 14 Stat. 521, amended by Act of June 22, 1874, 18 Stat., Pt. 3, p.\xc2\xa0182; Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, \xc2\xa76, 30 Stat. 548, 11 U.

We engage the point only because Reilly suggests that the 1991 schedule revisions requiring debtors to provide such an estimate on the schedule of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt\xe2\x80\x9d means that the estimate must be viewed as part of the exemption and is therefore subject to the Rule.

Where the debtor genuinely intended to claim nothing more than the face value of the exempt interest (which is rational if a debtor wishes to ensure that his aggregate exemptions remain within statutory limits), such an approach would engender needless objections and litigation, particularly if the equation that would precipitate the objection often results from a default software entry.

Nothing about Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule entries establishes that Schwab should have treated Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claim for $10,718, an unobjectionable amount under the Code provisions she expressly invoked, as an objectionable claim for thousands of dollars more than those provisions allow, or as a claim for an uncapped exemption under Code provisions she did not invoke and the dissent admits are \xe2\x80\x9cnot at issue here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A trustee will not always file an objection.  As the United States observes, Schwab did not do so in this case with respect to certain assets (perishable foodstuffs from Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s commercial kitchen) that could not be readily sold.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 28, n.\xc2\xa07 (explaining that Schwab could have objected to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s claim of a wildcard exemption for an interest in the food totaling $2,036 because this claim, combined with her wildcard claims for an interest of $8,868 in her business equipment and interests totaling $26 in her bank accounts, placed the total value of the interests she claimed exempt under the wildcard provision $975 above then-applicable limits).</p>\n<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s clouded-title argument arises only if one accepts her flawed conception of the exemptions in this case.  According to Reilly, \xe2\x80\x9conce the thirty-day deadline passed without objection\xe2\x80\x9d to her claim, she was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to know that she would emerge from bankruptcy with her cooking equipment intact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 57.  There are two problems with this argument.  First, it assumes that the property she claimed as exempt was the full value of the equipment.  That assumption is incorrect for the reasons we explain.  Second, her argument assumes that a claim to exempt the full value of the equipment would, if unopposed, entitle her to the equipment itself as opposed to a payment equal to the equipment\xe2\x80\x99s full value.  That assumption is at least questionable.  Section 541 is clear that title to the equipment passed to Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s estate at the commencement of her case, and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7522(d)(5) and (6) are equally clear that her reclamation right is limited to exempting an interest in the equipment, not the equipment itself.  Accordingly, it is far from obvious that the Code would \xe2\x80\x9centitle\xe2\x80\x9d Reilly to clear title in the equipment even if she claimed as exempt a \xe2\x80\x9cfull\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c100%\xe2\x80\x9d interest in it (which she did not).  Of course, it is likely that a trustee who fails to object to such a claim would have little incentive to do anything but pass title in the asset to the debtor.  But that does not establish the statutory entitlement Reilly claims.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963289">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nGINSBURG, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nSCHWAB V.

Within 30 days after the meeting of creditors, the trustee or a creditor may file an objection to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s designation of property as exempt.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).  Absent timely objection, \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed [by the debtor] as exempt \xe2\x80\xa6 is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trustee in this case, petitioner William G. Schwab, maintains that the obligation promptly to object to exemption claims extends only to the qualification of an asset as exemptible, not to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of the asset.  Respondent Nadejda Reilly, the debtor-in-bankruptcy, urges that the timely objection requirement applies not only to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s designation of an asset as exempt; the requirement applies as well, she asserts, to her estimate of the asset\xe2\x80\x99s market value.  That is so, she reasons, because the asset\xe2\x80\x99s current dollar value is critical to the determination whether she may keep the property intact and outside bankruptcy, or whether the trustee, at any time during the course of the proceedings, may sell it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that challenges to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of exemptible assets need not be made within the 30-day period allowed for \xe2\x80\x9cobjection[s] to the list of property claimed as exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 4003(b).  Instead, according to the Court, no time limit constrains the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s (or a creditor\xe2\x80\x99s) prerogative to place at issue the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the property as fully exempt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision drastically reduces Rule 4003\xe2\x80\x99s governance, for challenges to valuation have been, until today, the most common type of objection leveled against exemption claims.  See 9 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb64003.04, p. 4003\xe2\x80\x9315 (rev. 15th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Collier) (\xe2\x80\x9cNormally, objections to exemptions will focus primarily on issues of valuation.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition to departing from the prevailing understanding and practice, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision exposes debtors to protracted uncertainty concerning their right to retain exempt property, thereby impeding the \xe2\x80\x9cfresh start\xe2\x80\x9d exemptions are designed to foster.  In accord with the courts below, I would hold that a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of exempt property counts and becomes conclusive absent a timely objection.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nadejda Reilly is a cook who operated a one-person catering business.  Unable to cover her debts, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition appending all required schedules and statements.  Relevant here, her filings included a form captioned \xe2\x80\x9cSchedule B - Personal Property,\xe2\x80\x9d which called for enumeration of \xe2\x80\x9call personal property of the debtor of whatever kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 40a.  On that all-encompassing schedule, Reilly listed \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, her kitchen equipment, with a current market value of $10,718.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reilly also filed the more particular form captioned \xe2\x80\x9cSchedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 56a.  Schedule C contained four columns, the first headed \xe2\x80\x9cDescription of Property\xe2\x80\x9d; the second, \xe2\x80\x9cSpecify Law Providing Each Exemption\xe2\x80\x9d; the third, \xe2\x80\x9cValue of Claimed Exemption\xe2\x80\x9d; and the fourth, \xe2\x80\x9cCurrent Market Value of Property Without Deducting Exemptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 57a.  In the first column of Schedule C, Reilly wrote, as she did in Schedule B\xe2\x80\x99s description-of-property column: \xe2\x80\x9cSee attached list of business equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 58a.  On the list appended to Schedules B and C, Reilly set out by hand a 31-item inventory of her restaurant-plus-catering-venture equipment.  Next to each item, <em>e.g</em>., \xe2\x80\x9cDough Mixer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGas stove,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHood,\xe2\x80\x9d she specified, first, the purchase price and, next, \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s Market Value,\xe2\x80\x9d which added up to $10,718 for the entire inventory.  <em>Id.</em>, at 51a\xe2\x80\x9355a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the laws securing exemption of her kitchen equipment, Reilly specified in the second Schedule C column, \xc2\xa7552(d)(6), the exemption covering trade tools, and \xc2\xa7552(d)(5), the \xe2\x80\x9cwildcard\xe2\x80\x9d exemption.  <em>Id.</em>, at 58a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In the value-of-claimed-exemption column, she listed $1,850, then the maximum trade-tools exemption, and $8,868, drawn from her wildcard exemption, amounts adding up to $10,718.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And in the fourth, current-market-value, column, she recorded $10,718, corresponding to the total market value she had set out in her inventory and reported in Schedule B.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the 30-day clock on filing objections had begun to run, an appraiser told Schwab that Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s equipment was worth at least $17,000.  Brief for Petitioner 15; App. 164a.  Nevertheless, Schwab did not object to the $10,718 market value Reilly attributed to her business equipment in Schedule C and the attached inventory.  Instead, he allowed the limitations period to lapse and then moved, unsuccessfully, for permission to sell the equipment at auction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 141a\xe2\x80\x93143a.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s filings, the Bankruptcy Judge found it evident that Reilly had claimed the property itself, not its dollar value, as exempt.  <em>Id</em>., at 168a\xe2\x80\x93169a (\xe2\x80\x9cI know there\xe2\x80\x99s an argument \xe2\x80\xa6 that \xe2\x80\xa6 the property identified as exempt is really the [valuation] column, [<em>i.e.,</em> $10,718,] but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the forms say.  The forms say property declared as exempt and to see attached list.  So, they\xe2\x80\x99re exempting all the property\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

Both courts looked to \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(b), which state, respectively:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe debtor shall file a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt on such list is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA party in interest may file an objection to the list of property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after the meeting of creditors held under \xc2\xa7341(a) is concluded \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  The court may, for cause, extend the time for filing objections if, before the time to object expires, a party in interest files a request for an extension.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 4003(b).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Schwab having filed no objection within the allowable 30 days, each of the tribunals below ruled that the entire inventory of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s business equipment qualified as exempt in full.  App. 168a; 403 B.\xc2\xa0R., at 339; 534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 178.  The leading treatise on bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals noted, <em>id.</em>, at 180, n.\xc2\xa04, is in accord:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNormally, if the debtor lists property as exempt, that listing is interpreted as a claim for exemption of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s entire interest in the property, and the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of that interest is treated as the amount of the exemption claimed.  Were it otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that is, if the listing were construed to claim as exempt only that portion of the property having the value stated\xe2\x80\x94the provisions finalizing exemptions if no objections are filed would be rendered meaningless.  The trustee or creditors could [anytime] claim that the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the property was greater than the value claimed as exempt and [then] object to the debtor exempting his or her entire interest in the property after the deadline for objections had passed.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 Collier \xc2\xb64003.02[1], pp. 4003\xe2\x80\x934 to 4003\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Agreeing with the courts below, I would hold that Reilly, by her precise identification of the exempt property, and her specification of $10,718 as both the current market value of her kitchen equipment and the value of the claimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She claimed as exempt the listed property itself\xe2\x80\x94not the dollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by Schwab might yield.  Because neither Schwab nor any creditor lodged a timely objection, the listed property became exempt, reclaimed as property of the debtor, and therefore outside the bankruptcy estate the trustee is charged to administer.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>), Reilly filed a list of property she claimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy.  Her filing left no doubt that her exemption claim encompassed her entire inventory of kitchen equipment.  Schwab, in fact, was fully aware of the nature of the claim Reilly asserted.  At the meeting of creditors, Reilly reiterated that she sought to keep the equipment in her possession; she would rather discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding, she made plain, than lose her equipment.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa03.  Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) requires the trustee, if he contests the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s exemption claim in whole or part, to file an objection within 30 days after the meeting of creditors.  Absent a timely objection, \xe2\x80\x9cthe property claimed as exempt \xe2\x80\xa6 is exempt.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7522(<em>l</em>); Rule 4003.  That prescription should be dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds, however, that Schwab was not obliged to file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed, and indeed could auction off her cooking equipment anytime prior to her discharge.  In so holding, the Court decrees that no objection need be made to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of her property. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support the conclusion that Rule 4003\xe2\x80\x99s timely objection requirement does not encompass the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estimation of her property\xe2\x80\x99s market value, the Court homes in on the language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to a monetary cap.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Those prescriptions, the Court points out, \xe2\x80\x9cdefine the \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99 a debtor may \xe2\x80\x98clai[m] as exempt\xe2\x80\x99 as the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94up to a specified dollar amount\xe2\x80\x94in the assets described in the category, <em>not</em> as the assets themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  So long as a debtor values her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below the statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its-face permissible no matter the market value she ascribes to the asset.  To evaluate the propriety of Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s declared \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes, Schwab was obliged promptly to inspect \xe2\x80\x9cthree, and only three, entries on Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s Schedule C: the description of the business equipment \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0; the Code provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in the column titled \xe2\x80\x98value of claimed exemption.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s account, however, shuts from sight the vital part played by the fourth entry on Schedule C\xe2\x80\x94current market value\xe2\x80\x94when a capped exemption is claimed.  A debtor who estimates a market value <em>below</em> the cap, and lists an identical amount as the value of her claimed exemption, thereby signals that her aim is to keep the listed property in her possession, outside the estate-in-bankruptcy.  In contrast, a debtor who estimates a market value <em>above</em> the cap, and above the value of her claimed exemption, thereby recognizes that she cannot shelter the property itself and that the trustee may seek to sell it for whatever it is worth.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Schedule C\xe2\x80\x99s final column, in other words, alerts the trustee whether the debtor is claiming a right to retain the listed property itself as her own, a right secured to her if the trustee files no timely objection.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because an asset\xe2\x80\x99s market value is key to determining the character of the interest the debtor is asserting in that asset, Rule 4003(b) is properly read to require objections to valuation within 30 days, just as the Rule requires timely objections to the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s description of the property, the asserted legal basis for the exemption, and the claimed value of the exemption.

Would trustees lack fair notice of the need to object?  And would debtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an effort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions?  In my judgment, all three questions should be answered no.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court suggests that requiring timely objections to a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s valuation of exempt property would saddle trustees with an unmanageable load.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18 (declining to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand \xe2\x80\xa6 the universe of information an interested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a claimed exemption\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9333; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>24.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  But trustees, sooner or later, must attempt to ascertain the market value of exempted assets.  They must do so to determine whether sale of the items would likely produce surplus proceeds for the estate above the value of the claimed exemption, see \xc2\xa7704(a)(1); the only question, then, is <em>when</em> this market valuation must occur\xe2\x80\x94(1) within 30 days or (2) at any time before discharge?  Removing valuation from Rule 4003\xe2\x80\x99s governance thus does little to reduce the labors trustees must undertake.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 30-day objection period, I note, does not impose on trustees any <em>additional</em> duty, but rather guides the exercise of <em>existing </em>responsibilities; under Rule 4003(b), a trustee must rank evaluation of the debtor\xe2\x80\x99s exemptions as a priority item in his superintendence of the estate.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  And if the trustee entertains any doubt about the accuracy of a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s estimation of market value, the procedure for interposing objections is hardly arduous.  The trustee need only file with the court a simple declaration stating that an item\xe2\x80\x99s value exceeds the amount listed by the debtor.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the trustee needs more than 30 days to assess market value, moreover, the time period is eminently extendable.  Rule 4003(b) prescribes that a trustee may, for cause, ask the court for an extension of the objection period.  Alternatively, the trustee can postpone the conclusion of the meeting of creditors, from which the 30-day clock runs, simply by adjourning the meeting to a future date.  Rule 2003(e).  A trustee also may examine the debtor under oath at the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 meeting, Rule 2003(b)(1); if he gathers information impugning her exemption claims, he may ask the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing to determine valuation issues, Rule 4003(c).  See <em>Taylor</em>, 503 U. S., at 644 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf [the trustee] did not know the value of [a claimed exemption], he could have sought a hearing on the issue \xe2\x80\xa6 or \xe2\x80\xa6 asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of time to object.\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also NACBA Brief 19, 21\xe2\x80\x9323 (listing ways trustees may enlarge the limitations period for objections).  Trustees, in sum, have ample mechanisms at their disposal to gain the time and information they need to lodge objections to valuation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On affording trustees fair notice of the need to object, the Court emphasizes that a debtor must list her claimed exemptions \xe2\x80\x9cin a manner that makes the scope of the exemption clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  If a debtor wishes to exempt property in its entirety, for example, the Court counsels her to write \xe2\x80\x9cfull fair market value (FMV)\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c100% of FMV\xe2\x80\x9d in Schedule C\xe2\x80\x99s value-of-claimed-exemption column.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Our decision in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz</em>, the Court notes, is instructive.  In <em>Taylor</em>, the debtor recorded the term \xe2\x80\x9c$\xc2\xa0<em>unknown</em>\xe2\x80\x9d as the value of a claimed exemption, which, the Court observes, raised a \xe2\x80\x9cwarning fla[g]\xe2\x80\x9d because the value \xe2\x80\x9cwas <em>not</em> plainly within the limits the Code allows.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0True, a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s schedules must give notice sufficient to cue the trustee that an objection may be in order.  But a \xe2\x80\x9cwarning flag\xe2\x80\x9d is in the eye of the beholder: If a debtor lists identical amounts as the market value of exempted property and the value of her claimed exemption, she has, <em>on the face of her schedules</em>, reclaimed the entire asset just as surely as if she had recorded \xe2\x80\x9c100% of FMV\xe2\x80\x9d in Schedule C\xe2\x80\x99s value-of-claimed-exemption column.

See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x936.  To borrow the Court\xe2\x80\x99s terminology, Reilly waved a \xe2\x80\x9cwarning flag\xe2\x80\x9d that should have prompted Schwab to object if he believed the equipment could not be reclaimed in its entirety because its value exceeded the statutory cap.  534 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 179.

As just noted, the Court counsels debtors wishing to exempt an asset in full to write \xe2\x80\x9c100% of FMV\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfull FMV\xe2\x80\x9d in the value-of-claimed-exemption column.

The Court rejected an argument along these lines in <em>Taylor</em>, and should follow suit here.  Multiple measures, <em>Taylor </em>explained, discourage undervaluation of property claimed as exempt.  503 U. S., at 644.  Among those measures: The debtor files her exemption claim under penalty of perjury.  See Rule 1008.  She risks judicial sanction for signing documents not well grounded in fact.  Rule 9011.

Assets of larger worth, however, are subject to liquidation so that creditors may obtain a portion of the item\xe2\x80\x99s value.  Cf. <em>In\xc2\xa0re Price</em>, 370 F.\xc2\xa03d 362, 378 (CA3 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]ankruptcy law is bilateral, replete with protections and policy considerations favoring both debtors and creditors.\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The significance of market value is what differentiates capped exemptions from uncapped ones that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind regardless of its worth.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa05.  For uncapped exemptions, the nature of the property the debtor has reclaimed is clear: If the exemption is valid, the debtor gets the asset in full every time.  For capped exemptions, however, market value is a crucial component in determining whether the debtor gets the item itself or a sum of money representing a share of the item\xe2\x80\x99s liquidation value.  Reading Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) to require objections to valuation thus does not, as the Court contends, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>elid[e]</em> the distinction\xe2\x80\x9d between capped and uncapped exemptions, <em>ante</em>, at 12 (emphasis added), but instead <em>accounts</em> <em>for</em> that distinction.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Suggesting that this interpretation of Rule 4003(b) \xe2\x80\x9clacks statutory support,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13, n.\xc2\xa011, the Court repeatedly emphasizes that the Bankruptcy Code defines the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty claimed as exempt,\xe2\x80\x9d to which a trustee must object, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe debtor\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94up to a specified dollar amount\xe2\x80\x94in the assets described in [capped exemption] categor[ies],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10; see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at<em> </em>11; <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa09; <em>ante</em>, at 21, n.\xc2\xa019.  But the commonly understood definition of a property \xe2\x80\x9cinterest\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[a] legal share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.
