Joshua English died in 1850, leaving the plaintiff, then the wife of said Samuel Burgess, as his sole surviving child and heir-at-law.  Plaintiff\'s husband died in July, 1874.  The court instructs you that said grants from the State of Tennessee vested the legal title to the five thousand acres of land therein described in said Joshua English only, and that upon his death, said title descended and vested in plaintiff as his sole heir-at-law. . . .  The defendants seek to defeat her title. . . .
