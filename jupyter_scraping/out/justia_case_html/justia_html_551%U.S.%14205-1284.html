Philip Morris removed the case to Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute, which permits removal of an action against \xe2\x80\x9cany officer (<em>or any person acting under</em> <em>that officer</em>) of the United States or of any agency thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The federal court upheld the removal, ruling that the complaint attacked Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 use of the <em>Government\xe2\x80\x99s </em>method of testing cigarettes and thus that petitioners had sued Philip Morris for \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Trade Commission.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s detailed supervision of the cigarette testing process and likening the case to others in which lower courts permitted removal by heavily supervised Government contractors.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The fact that a federal agency directs, supervises, and monitors a company\xe2\x80\x99s activities in considerable detail does not bring that company within \xc2\xa71442(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s scope and thereby permit removal.

S. 510</a>, 517.  But broad language is not limitless.  And a liberal construction nonetheless can find limits in a text\xe2\x80\x99s language, context, history, and purposes.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s history and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases demonstrate that its basic purpose is to protect the Federal Government from the interference with its \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d that would ensue were a State able, for example, to \xe2\x80\x9carres[t]\xe2\x80\x9d and bring \xe2\x80\x9cto trial in a State cour[t] for an alleged offense against the law of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cofficers and agents\xe2\x80\x9d of the Government \xe2\x80\x9cacting \xe2\x80\xa6 within the scope of their authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Willingham</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/402/index.html">395 U. S. 402</a>, 406 (internal quotation marks omitted).  State-court proceedings may reflect \xe2\x80\x9clocal prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d against unpopular federal laws or officials, <em>e.g., Maryland</em> v. <em>Soper</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/index.html">270 U. S. 9</a>, 32, and States hostile to the Government may impede enforcement of federal law, see, <em>e.g., Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/index.html">100 U. S. 257</a>, 263, or deprive federal officials of a federal forum in which to assert federal immunity defenses, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Willingham, supra</em>, at 407.  The removal statute applies to private persons \xe2\x80\x9cwho lawfully assist\xe2\x80\x9d a federal officer \xe2\x80\x9cin the performance of his official duty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Davis</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/597/index.html">107 U. S. 597</a>, 600, but \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d if the private parties were \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized to act with or for [federal officers or agents] in affirmatively executing duties under \xe2\x80\xa6 federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>City of Greenwood</em> v. <em>Peacock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/808/index.html">384 U. S. 808</a>, 824.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The relevant relationship here is that of a private person \xe2\x80\x9c<em>acting under</em>\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cagency.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  In this context, \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to what the dictionaries describe as a relationship involving acting in a certain capacity, considered in relation to one holding a superior position or office, and typically includes subjection, guidance, or control.  Precedent and statutory purpose also make clear that the private person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d must involve an effort to <em>assist</em>, or to help <em>carry out, </em>the federal superior\xe2\x80\x99s duties or tasks.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>South Carolina, supra</em>, at 600.  Such aid does <em>not</em> include simply <em>complying</em> with the law.  When a company complies with a regulatory order, it does not ordinarily create a significant risk of state-court \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Soper, supra</em>, at 32.  A state-court suit brought against such a company is not likely to disable federal officials from taking necessary action designed to enforce federal law, cf. <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis, supra</em>, at 262\xe2\x80\x93263, nor to deny a federal forum to an individual entitled to assert a federal immunity claim, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Willingham, supra</em>, at 407.  Thus, a private firm\xe2\x80\x99s compliance (or noncompliance) with federal laws, rules, and regulations does not by itself fall within the scope of the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cacting  under\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficial,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the regulation is highly detailed and even if the private firm\xe2\x80\x99s activities are highly supervised and monitored.  A contrary determination would expand the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope considerably, potentially bringing within it state-court actions filed against private firms in many highly regulated industries.  Nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language, history, or purpose indicates a congressional intent to do so.  Pp. 7\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 two arguments to the contrary are rejected.  First, it contends that if close supervision is sufficient to turn a Gov-\nernment contractor into a private firm \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d a Government \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cofficer,\xe2\x80\x9d as lower courts have held, it is sufficient to transform a company subjected to intense regulation.  The answer to this argument is that the assistance that private contractors provide federal officers goes beyond simple compliance with the law and helps the officers fulfill other basic governmental tasks.  Second, Philip Morris argues that it is \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d FTC officers when it conducts cigarette testing because, after initially testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine, the FTC <em>delegated authority</em> for that task to the tobacco industry in 1987 and has thereafter extensively supervised and closely monitored testing.  This argument contains a fatal flaw of omission.  Although it uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no evidence of any delegation of legal authority from the FTC to the tobacco industry to undertake testing on the Government agency\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, or evidence of any contract, payment, employer/employee relationship, or principal/agent arrangement.  The existence of detailed FTC rules indicates regulation, not delegation.  The usual regulator/regulated relationship cannot be construed as bringing Philip Morris within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms.

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lisa Watson and Loretta Lawson, the petitioners, filed a civil lawsuit in Arkansas state court claiming that the Philip Morris Companies, the respondents, violated state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices.  The complaint focuses upon advertisements and packaging that describe certain Philip Morris brand cigarettes (Marlboro and Cambridge Lights) as \xe2\x80\x9clight,\xe2\x80\x9d a term indicating lower tar and nicotine levels than those present in other cigarettes.  More specifically, the complaint refers to the design and performance of Philip Morris cigarettes that are tested in accordance with the Cambridge Filter Method, a method that \xe2\x80\x9cthe tobacco industry [uses] to \xe2\x80\x98measure\xe2\x80\x99 tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a\xe2\x80\x9364a.  The complaint charges that Philip Morris \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulat[ed] the design\xe2\x80\x9d of its cigarettes, and \xe2\x80\x9cemploy[ed] techniques that\xe2\x80\x9d would cause its cigarettes \xe2\x80\x9cto register lower levels of tar and nicotine on [the Cambridge Filter Method] than would be delivered to the consumers of the product.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 63a\xe2\x80\x9365a.  The complaint adds that the Philip Morris cigarettes delivered \xe2\x80\x9cgreater amounts of tar and nicotine when smoked under actual conditions\xe2\x80\x9d than the adjective \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d as used in its advertising indicates.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a.  In view of these and other related practices, the complaint concludes that Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 behavior was \xe2\x80\x9cdeceptive and misleading\xe2\x80\x9d under Arkansas law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 64a, 66a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Philip Morris, referring to the federal officer removal statute, removed the case to Federal District Court.  That court, in turn, held that the statute authorized the removal.  The court wrote that the complaint attacked Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 use of the <em>Government\xe2\x80\x99s </em>method of testing cigarettes.  For this reason (and others), it held that the petitioners had sued Philip Morris for \xe2\x80\x9cact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d taken \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Trade Commission, a federal agency (staffed by federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court certified the question for interlocutory review.  And the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Like the District Court, it emphasized the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s detailed supervision of the cigarette testing process.  It also cited lower court cases permitting removal by heavily supervised Government contractors.  See 420 F.\xc2\xa03d 852, 857 (2005); <em>Winters </em>v. <em>Diamond Shamrock Chemical Co., </em>149 F.\xc2\xa03d 387 (CA5 1998) (authorizing removal of a tort suit against private defense contractors that manufactured Agent Orange).  The Eighth Circuit concluded that Philip Morris was \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s],\xe2\x80\x9d namely the FTC, with respect to the challenged conduct.  420 F. 3d, at 854.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  549 U.

And we now reverse the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s determination.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal statute permits removal only if Philip Morris, in carrying out the \xe2\x80\x9cact[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that are the subject of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint, was \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a)(1).  The words \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d are broad, and this Court has made clear that the statute must be \xe2\x80\x9cliberally construed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Symes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/510/index.html">286 U. S. 510</a>, 517 (1932); see <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Manypenny</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/232/index.html">451 U.

And a liberal construction nonetheless can find limits in a text\xe2\x80\x99s language, context, history, and purposes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beginning with history, we note that Congress enacted the original federal officer removal statute near the end of the War of 1812, a war that was not popular in New England.  See <em>id.</em>, at 405.  Indeed, shipowners from that region filed many state-court claims against federal customs officials charged with enforcing a trade embargo with England.  See Wiecek, The Reconstruction of Federal Judicial Power, 1863\xe2\x80\x931875, 13 Am. J. Legal Hist. 333, 337 (1969).  Congress responded with a provision that permitted federal customs officers and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any other person aiding or assisting</em>\xe2\x80\x9d those officers to remove a case filed against them \xe2\x80\x9cin any state court\xe2\x80\x9d to federal court.  Customs Act of 1815, ch. 31, \xc2\xa78, 3 Stat. 198 (emphasis added).  This initial removal statute was \xe2\x80\x9c[o]bviously \xe2\x80\xa6 an attempt to protect federal officers from interference by hostile state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Willingham</em>, 395 U. S., at 405.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the early 1830\xe2\x80\x99s, South Carolina passed a Nullification Act declaring federal tariff laws unconstitutional and authorizing prosecution of the federal agents who collected the tariffs.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Congress then enacted a new statute that permitted \xe2\x80\x9cany officer of the United States, <em>or other person</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to remove to federal court a lawsuit filed against the officer \xe2\x80\x9cfor or on account of any act done under the revenue laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 57, \xc2\xa73, 4 Stat. 633 (emphasis added).  As Senator Daniel Webster explained at the time, where state courts might prove hostile to federal law, and hence to those who enforced that law, the removal statute would \xe2\x80\x9cgive a chance to the [federal] officer to defend himself where the authority of the law was recognised.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 Cong. Deb. 461 (1833).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soon after the Civil War, Congress enacted yet another officer removal statute, permitting removal of a suit against any revenue officer \xe2\x80\x9con account of any act done under color of his office\xe2\x80\x9d by the revenue officer and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any person acting under or by authority of any such officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>Act of July 13, 1866, ch. 184, \xc2\xa767, 14 Stat. 171 (emphasis added).  Elsewhere the statute restricted these latter persons to those engaged in acts \xe2\x80\x9cfor the collection of taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa767, <em>id.,</em> at 172.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1948, Congress again revised the statute, dropping its limitation to the revenue context.  And it included the rewritten statute within its 1948 recodification.  See Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, \xc2\xa71442(a), 62 Stat. 938, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a).  It is this version of the statute that, with the exception of a modification in response to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>International Primate Protection League</em> v. <em>Administrators of Tulane Ed. Fund</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/72/index.html">500 U. S. 72</a> (1991), is now before us.  While Congress expanded the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to include all federal officers, it nowhere indicated any intent to change the scope of words, such as \xe2\x80\x9cacting under,\xe2\x80\x9d that described the triggering relationship between a private entity and a federal officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to precedent, we point to three cases, all involving illegal liquor, which help to illustrate the need for, and the workings of, the pre-1948 removal statutes.  In 1878, a federal revenue officer, James Davis, raided an illegal distillery in Tennessee; was ambushed by several armed men; returned the ambushers\xe2\x80\x99 gunfire; and shot one of his attackers dead.  See <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/index.html">100 U. S. 257</a>, 261 (1880).  Tennessee indicted Davis for murder.  The Court held that the statute permitted Davis to remove the case to federal court,<font b="1"> reasoning that the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9ccan act only through its officers and agents, and they must act within the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 263.  Removal, the Court found, would help to prevent hostile States from \xe2\x80\x9cparalyz[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Government and its initiatives.  <em>Ibid.</em></font></p><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About the same time, a U. S. Army corporal (also called Davis, Lemuel Davis) along with several other soldiers helped a federal revenue officer try to arrest a distiller for violating the internal-revenue laws.  The soldiers surrounded the house; the distiller escaped through a hole in a side wall; Corporal Davis shot the suspect; and South Carolina indicted Davis for murder.  Davis removed the case, and this Court upheld the removal.  The Court acknowledged that, although Davis was not a revenue officer, he was a person \xe2\x80\x9cwho lawfully assist[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a revenue officer \xe2\x80\x9cin the performance of his official duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/107/597/index.html">107 U. S. 597</a>, 600 (1883).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s, Maryland charged a group of prohibition agents and a private person acting as their driver with a murder committed during a distillery raid.  See <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Soper,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/index.html">270 U. S. 9</a> (1926).  The prohibition agents and their driver sought to remove the state murder trial to federal court.  This Court ultimately rejected their removal efforts for reasons not relevant here.  But in doing so it pointed out that the private person acting \xe2\x80\x9cas a chauffeur and helper to the four officers under their orders and \xe2\x80\xa6 direction\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cthe same right to the benefit of\xe2\x80\x9d the removal provision as did the federal agents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from demonstrating the dangers associated with working in the illegal alcohol business, these three cases\xe2\x80\x94<em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, and<em> Maryland </em>v.<em> Soper</em>\xe2\x80\x94illustrate that the removal statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbasic\xe2\x80\x9d purpose is to protect the Federal Government from the interference with its \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d that would ensue were a State able, for example, to \xe2\x80\x9carres[t]\xe2\x80\x9d and bring \xe2\x80\x9cto trial in a State cour[t] for an alleged offense against the law of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cofficers and agents\xe2\x80\x9d of the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9cacting \xe2\x80\xa6 within the scope of their authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Willingham</em>, 395 U.

State-court proceedings may reflect \xe2\x80\x9clocal prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d against unpopular federal laws or federal officials.  <em>Soper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 32; see <em>Manypenny</em>, 451 U.

In addition, States hostile to the Federal Government may impede through delay federal revenue collection or the enforcement of other federal law.  See <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 263; cf. <em>Findley</em> v. <em>Satterfield</em>, 9 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 67, 68 (No. 4,792) (CC ND Ga. 1877).  And States may deprive federal officials of a federal forum in which to assert federal immunity defenses.  See <em>International Primate Protection League,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 86\xe2\x80\x9387; <em>Willingham</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 407 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne of the most important reasons for removal is to have the validity of the defense of official immunity tried in a federal court\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Jefferson County</em> v. <em>Acker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/423/index.html">527 U.

Regardless, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>South Carolina</em> the Court wrote that the removal statute applies to private persons \xe2\x80\x9cwho lawfully assist\xe2\x80\x9d the federal officer \xe2\x80\x9cin the performance of his official duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  107 U.

See <em>Mesa</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/121/index.html">489 U.

The relevant relationship is that of a private person \xe2\x80\x9c<em>acting under</em>\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cagency.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  In this context, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to what has been described as a relationship that involves \xe2\x80\x9cacting in a certain capacity, considered in relation to one holding a superior position or office.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 Oxford English Dictionary 948 (2d ed. 1989).  That relationship typically involves \xe2\x80\x9csubjection, guidance, or control.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 2765 (2d ed. 1953).  See also Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 2604 (1942) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubordinate or subservient to,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to guidance, tutorship, or direction of\xe2\x80\x9d); 18 Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra,</em> at 949 (\xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to the instruction, direction, or guidance of\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, precedent and statutory purpose make clear that the private person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d must involve an effort to <em>assist</em>, or to help <em>carry out, </em>the duties or tasks of the federal superior.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 600; see also <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, the help or assistance necessary to bring a private person within the scope of the statute does <em>not</em> include simply <em>complying</em> with the law.  We recognize that sometimes an English speaker might say that one who complies with the law \xe2\x80\x9chelps\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cassists\xe2\x80\x9d governmental law enforcement.  Taxpayers who fill out complex federal tax forms, airline passengers who obey federal regulations prohibiting smoking, for that matter well-behaved federal prisoners, all \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d federal law enforcement authorities in some sense of those words.  But that is not the sense of \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d that can bring a private action within the scope of this statute.  That is in part a matter of language.  One would usually describe the behavior of the taxpayers, airline passengers, and prisoners we have described as <em>compliance </em>with the law (or <em>acquiescence </em>to an order), not as \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d a federal official who is giving an order or enforcing the law.  It is also in part a matter of the history and the precedent we have discussed.  See <em>supra</em>, at<em> </em>3\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, it is a matter of statutory purpose.  When a company subject to a regulatory order (even a highly complex order) complies with the order, it does not ordinarily create a significant risk of state-court \xe2\x80\x9cprejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Soper</em>, 270 U. S., at 32; <em>Manypenny</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 241\xe2\x80\x93242.  Nor is a state-court lawsuit brought against such a company likely to disable federal officials from taking necessary action designed to enforce federal law.  Cf. <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, 100 U. S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.  Nor is such a lawsuit likely to deny a federal forum to an individual entitled to assert a federal claim of immunity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Willingham</em>, 395 U. S.<em>,</em> at 407.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that a highly regulated firm cannot find a statutory basis for removal in the fact of federal regulation alone.  A private firm\xe2\x80\x99s compliance (or noncompliance) with federal laws, rules, and regulations does not by itself fall within the scope of the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficial.\xe2\x80\x9d  And that is so even if the regulation is highly detailed and even if the private firm\xe2\x80\x99s activities are highly supervised and monitored.  A contrary determination would expand the scope of the statute considerably, potentially bringing within its scope state-court actions filed against private firms in many highly regulated industries.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7136a (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) (mandating disclosure of testing results in the context of pesticide registration).  Neither language, nor history, nor purpose lead us to believe that Congress intended any such expansion.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Philip Morris advances two important arguments to the contrary.  First, it points out that lower courts have held that Government contractors fall within the terms of the federal officer removal statute, at least when the relationship between the contractor and the Government is an unusually close one involving detailed regulation, monitoring, or supervision.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Winters,</em> 149 F.\xc2\xa03d 387.  And it asks why, if close supervision is sufficient to turn a private contractor into a private firm \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d a Government \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cofficer,\xe2\x80\x9d does it not do the same when a company is subjected to intense regulation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The answer to this question lies in the fact that the private contractor in such cases is helping the Government to produce an item that it needs.  The assistance that private contractors provide federal officers goes beyond simple compliance with the law and helps officers fulfill other basic governmental tasks.  In the context of <em>Winters</em>, for example, Dow Chemical fulfilled the terms of a contractual agreement by providing the Government with a product that it used to help conduct a war.  Moreover, at least arguably, Dow performed a job that, in the absence of a contract with a private firm, the Government itself would have had to perform.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These circumstances distinguish <em>Winters </em>from this case.  For present purposes that distinction is sufficient.  And we need not further examine here (a case where private contracting is not at issue) whether and when particular circumstances may enable private contractors to invoke the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Philip Morris argues that its activities at issue here did not consist simply of compliance with regulatory laws, rules, and orders.  It contends that the FTC, after initially testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>delegated authority</em>\xe2\x80\x9d for that task to an industry-financed testing laboratory in 1987.  <em>E.g.</em>, Brief for Respondents 31 (emphasis added).  And Philip Morris asserts that (along with other cigarette companies) it was acting pursuant to that delegation.  It adds that ever since this initial \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation\xe2\x80\x9d the FTC has \xe2\x80\x9cextensive[ly] \xe2\x80\xa6 supervis[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cclosely monitored\xe2\x80\x9d the manner in which the laboratory tests cigarettes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 37, 30, 39.  Philip Morris concludes that, given all these circumstances, just as Dow was \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d officers of the Department of Defense when it manufactured Agent Orange, see <em>Winters</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 399, so Philip Morris is \xe2\x80\x9cacting under\xe2\x80\x9d officers of the FTC when it conducts cigarette testing.  See Brief for Respondents 38.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake we shall overlook the fact that the petitioners appear to challenge the way in which Philip Morris \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned\xe2\x80\x9d its <em>cigarettes</em>, not the way in which it (or the industry laboratory) conducted cigarette testing.  We also shall assume the following testing-related facts that Philip Morris sets forth in its brief:</p>\n<p align="left">(1)\xe2\x80\x82In the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, the FTC ordered tobacco companies to stop advertising the amount of tar and nicotine contained in their cigarettes.  See <em>id.,</em> at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n(2)\xe2\x80\x82In 1966, the FTC altered course.  It permitted cigarette companies to advertise \xe2\x80\x9ctar and nicotine yields\xe2\x80\x9d provided that the company had substantiated its statement through use of the Cambridge Filter Method, a testing method developed by Dr. Clyde Ogg, a Department of Agriculture employee.  <em>Id.</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n(3)\xe2\x80\x82The Cambridge Filter Method uses \xe2\x80\x9ca smoking machine that takes a 35 milliliter puff of two seconds\xe2\x80\x99 duration on a cigarette every 60 seconds until the cigarette is smoked to a specified butt length.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FTC</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, 778 F.\xc2\xa02d 35, 37 (CADC 1985).  It then measures the amount of tar and nicotine that is delivered.  That data, in turn, determine whether a cigarette may be labeled as \xe2\x80\x9clight.\xe2\x80\x9d  This method, Dr. Ogg has testified, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not tell a smoker how much tar and nicotine he will get from any given cigarette,\xe2\x80\x9d but it \xe2\x80\x9cwill indicate\xe2\x80\x9d whether a smoker \xe2\x80\x9cwill get more from one than from another cigarette if there is a significant difference between the two and if he smokes the two in the same manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 5\xe2\x80\x936 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n(4)\xe2\x80\x82In 1967, the FTC began to use its own laboratory to perform these tests.  See <em>id.</em>, at 6.  And the Cambridge Filter Method began to be referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98FTC Method.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n(5)\xe2\x80\x82The FTC published the testing results periodically and sent the results annually to Congress.  See <em>id.</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n(6)\xe2\x80\x82Due to cost considerations, the FTC stopped testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine in 1987.  Simultaneously, the tobacco industry assumed responsibility for cigarette testing, running the tests according to FTC specifications and permitting the FTC to monitor the process closely.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>(7)\xe2\x80\x82The FTC continues to publish the testing results and to send them to Congress.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n(8)\xe2\x80\x82The tobacco industry has followed the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that cigarette manufacturers disclose (and make claims about) tar and nicotine content based exclusively on the results of this testing.  See id.</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming this timeline, Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 argument nonetheless contains a fatal flaw\xe2\x80\x94a flaw of omission.  Although Philip Morris uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cdelegation\xe2\x80\x9d or variations many times throughout its brief, we have found no evidence of any delegation of legal authority from the FTC to the industry association to undertake testing on the Government agency\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  Nor is there evidence of any contract, any payment, any employer/employee relationship, or any principal/agent arrangement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have examined all of the documents to which Philip Morris and certain supporting <em>amici</em> refer.  Some of those documents refer to cigarette testing specifications, others refer to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s inspection and supervision of the industry laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s testing, and still others refer to the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of statements in cigarette advertising.  But none of these documents establish the type of formal delegation that might authorize Philip Morris to remove the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several former FTC officials, for example, filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in which they state that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n 198[7] the FTC delegated testing responsibility to the private Tobacco Industry Testing Lab (the \xe2\x80\x98TITL\xe2\x80\x99).\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Former Commissioners and Senior Staff of the FTC 11.  But in support of this proposition the brief cites a single source, a letter from the cigarette manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer to an FTC official.  That letter states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ajor United States cigarette manufacturers, who are responsible for the TITL\xe2\x80\x99s operations and on whose behalf we are writing, do not believe that Commission oversight is needed \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Nevertheless, as an accommodation and in the spirit of cooperation, the manufacturers are prepared to permit Commission employees to monitor the TITL testing program \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from John P. Rupp to Judith P. Wilkenfeld (June 30, 1987), online at http://tobaccodocuments.\norg/nysa_ti_s1/TI57900738.html (as visited June 7, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p align="left">\nNothing in this letter refers to a delegation of authority.  And neither Congress nor federal agencies normally delegate legal authority to private entities without saying that they are doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Without evidence of some such special relationship, Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 analogy to Government contracting breaks down.  We are left with the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s detailed rules about advertising, specifications for testing, requirements about reporting results, and the like.  This sounds to us like regulation, not delegation.  If there is a difference between this kind of regulation and, say, that of Food and Drug Administration regulation of prescription drug marketing and advertising (which also involve testing requirements), see <em>Serono Labs., Inc.</em> v. <em>Shalala</em>, 158 F.\xc2\xa03d 1313, 1316 (CADC 1998), that difference is one of degree, not kind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have pointed out, however, differences in the degree of regulatory detail or supervision cannot by themselves transform Philip Morris\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory <em>compliance</em> into the kind of assistance that might bring the FTC within the scope of the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>acting under</em>\xe2\x80\x9d a federal \xe2\x80\x9cofficer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Supra</em>, at 8.  And, though we find considerable regulatory detail and supervision, we can find nothing that warrants treating the FTC/Philip Morris relationship as distinct from the usual regulator/regulated relationship.  This relationship, as we have explained, cannot be construed as bringing Philip Morris within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></div>'
