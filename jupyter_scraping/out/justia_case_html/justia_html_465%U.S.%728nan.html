In <em>Califano v. Goldfarb,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/199/case.html">430 U. S. 199</a></span>, this Court affirmed a District Court judgment holding that the gender-based dependency requirement for widowers violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Thereafter, while repealing the dependency requirement for widowers and husbands, Congress, in order to avoid a fiscal drain on the Social Security trust fund, enacted a "pension offset" provision that generally requires the reduction of spousal benefits by the amount of Federal or State Government pensions received by the Social Security applicant.  However, in order to protect the interests of those individuals who had retired or were about to retire and who had planned their retirements in reliance on their entitlement, under pre-1977 law, to spousal benefits unreduced by government pension benefits, Congress exempted from the pension offset requirement those spouses who were eligible to receive pension benefits prior to December, 1982, and who would have qualified for unreduced spousal benefits under the Act as administered in January, 1977.  Congress also included a severability clause which, in substance, provides that, if the exception to the pension offset requirement is held invalid, that requirement would not be affected, and the application of the exception would not be broadened to include persons not included within it.  Appellee husband (hereafter appellee), after retiring from the United States Postal Service, applied for husband\'s benefits under the Act on account of his wife, who had retired earlier and was fully insured under the Act.  It was determined administratively that, although appellee was entitled to spousal benefits, they were entirely offset by his Postal Service pension pursuant to the pension offset provision of the Act.  Appellee and his wife then brought a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that application of the pension offset provision to him and other nondependent men, but not to similarly situated nondependent women, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that the severability clause was also unconstitutional.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="729">Page 465 U.

Appellee has standing to prosecute this action.  Because the right he asserts is the right to receive benefits according to classifications that do not without sufficient justification differentiate among covered applicants solely on the basis of sex, and not a substantive right to any particular amount of benefits, appellee\'s standing does not depend on his ability to obtain increased Social Security payments.  The right to equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution is not coextensive with any substantive rights to the benefits denied the party discriminated against.  Rather, discrimination itself, by perpetuating "archaic and stereotypic notions" or by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group as "innately inferior," and therefore less worthy participants in the political community, can cause serious noneconomic injuries to those persons who are denied equal treatment solely because of their membership in a disfavored group.  Because the severability clause would forbid only the extension of benefits to the excluded class and not the withdrawal of benefits from the favored class, the injury caused by the unequal treatment allegedly suffered by appellee may be redressed.

To interpret the exception, as appellee urges, so that it does not incorporate a gender-based classification of the kind invalidated in <em>Goldfarb,</em> but instead exempts from the offset requirement both men and women, without regard to dependency, would defeat Congress\' intention and, by rendering the offset requirement applicable to only a few applicants, frustrate the congressional aim of preventing a fiscal drain on the Social Security trust fund.

S. 731</a></p><p> of the Fifth Amendment.  In this case, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama held that amendments to the Act, adopted in 1977 partly in response to our decision, unjustifiably revive the gender-based classification that was invalidated in <em>Goldfarb,</em> and therefore also violate the Fifth Amendment.  App. to Juris. Statement 1a-9a.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services appealed directly to this Court.

Prior to December, 1977, benefits were payable only to those husbands or widowers who could demonstrate dependency on their wage-earning wives for one-half of their support.  Wives and widows, on the other hand, were entitled to spousal benefits without any such showing of dependency on their husbands.  <em>See</em> former 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 402(b), (c)(1)(C), and (f)(1)(D).  In March, 1977, <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, supra,</em> affirmed the judgment of a three-judge District Court which held that the gender-based dependency requirement for widowers violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Subsequently, the Court summarily affirmed two District Court decisions invalidating the dependency requirement for husbands\' benefits.  <em>Califano v.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  It concluded, however, that elimination of the dependency test, by increasing the number of individuals entitled to spousal benefits, could create a serious fiscal problem for the Social Security trust fund.  <em>See id.</em> at 27-28.  This problem was particularly acute with respect to the large number of retired federal and state employees who would now become eligible for spousal benefits.  Unlike most applicants, who must offset any dual Social Security benefits against each other, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 402(k)(3)(A), retired civil servants could, at the time of the 1977 Amendments, receive the full amount of both the spousal benefits and the government pensions to which they were entitled.  Congress estimated that payment of unreduced spousal benefits to such individuals could cost the system an estimated $190 million in 1979.  S.Rep. No. 95-572, <em>supra,</em> at 27-28.</p>\n<p>To avoid this fiscal drain, Congress included as part of the 1977 Amendments a "pension offset" provision that generally requires the reduction of spousal benefits by the amount of certain Federal or State Government pensions received by the Social Security applicant.  1977 Amendments, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 334 (a)(2) and (b)(2), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 402(b)(4)(A) and (c)(2)(A) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  Congress estimated that 90 percent of the savings that would be achieved by the pension offset provision as proposed by the Senate would be attributable to a reduction in payments to nondependent husbands and widowers who had not been entitled to any spousal benefits prior to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 465 U. S. 733</a></p><p> the decision in <em>Goldfarb.</em> <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 95-572, <em>supra,</em> at 81.  The remaining portion of the savings, however, would come from a reduction in benefits to individuals, mostly women but also dependent men, who had retired or were about to retire and who had planned their retirements in reliance on their entitlement, under pre-1977 law, to spousal benefits unreduced by government pension benefits.  <em>See ibid.;</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-837, p. 72 (1977); S.Conf.Rep. No. 95-612, p. 72 (1977).

The Conference Committee explained that the severability clause was enacted</p>\n<p>"so that, if [the exception to the pension offset provision] is found invalid, the pension-offset . . . would not be affected, and the application of the exception clause would not be broadened to include persons or circumstances that are not included within it."</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep.

Mathews (hereafter Mathews or appellee) retired from his job with the United States Postal Service on November 18, 1977.  His wife, who had retired from her job a few months earlier, was fully insured under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="735">Page 465 U. S. 735</a></p><p> Social Security Act.  In December, 1977, Mathews applied for husband\'s benefits on his wife\'s account.  On review of the application, the Social Security Administration (SSA) informed Mathews that he was entitled to spousal benefits of $153.30 per month but that, because, as appellee acknowledged, he was not dependent upon his wife for one-half of his support, this amount would be entirely offset by his $573 per month Postal Service pension in accordance with \xc2\xa7 334(b)(2) of the 1977 Amendments, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 402(c)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V).   App. to Juris.Statement 2a.  After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) affirmed the SSA\'s initial decision.  <em>Id.</em> at 16a-22a.  The ALJ\'s decision was, in turn, affirmed by the Appeals Council of the Department of Health and Human Services, and thereby became the final decision of the Secretary.  <em>Id.</em> at 13a-14a.</p>\n<p>Mathews and his wife then brought this class action against the Secretary in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama under \xc2\xa7 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 405(g).  The complaint alleged that application of the pension offset provision of the 1977 Amendments to Mathews and other nondependent men but not to similarly situated nondependent women violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and sought a declaratory judgment to that effect.  Appellee also contended that the severability clause of the 1977 Amendments was unconstitutional.  The District Court certified a nationwide class composed of</p>\n<p>"all applicants for husband\'s insurance benefits . . . whose applications . . . have been denied [beginning 60 days before the filing of the complaint] solely because of the statutory requirement that husbands must have received more than one-half of their support from their wives in order to be entitled to benefits."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris.Statement 10a.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the District Court filed an opinion, <em>id.</em> at 1a-9a, and order, <em>id.</em> at 27a-28a, holding both the pension offset exception of \xc2\xa7 334(g)(1)(B) and the severability clause of \xc2\xa7 334(g)(3) unconstitutional.  The court noted that, in essence, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="736">Page 465 U. S. 736</a></p><p> the exception to the pension offset</p>\n<p>"provides a five-year grace period for all women who retire within five years of the enactment, and for men who retire within five years of the enactment and who are economically dependent upon their wives."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 3a.  In light of this gender-based classification, the court noted that the offset exception could be upheld only if it "<em>serve[s] important governmental objectives and [is] substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 4a, quoting <em>Craig v. Boren,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html">429 U. S. 190</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html#197">429 U. S. 197</a></span> (1976).  The court decided that the exception could not be justified as protecting the reliance interests of individuals who had planned their retirements prior to the 1977 Amendments in expectation of undiminished benefits because, by requiring men to prove dependency notwithstanding the decision in <em>Goldfarb,</em> the offset exception presumes that\n</em></p>\n<p>"women would have relied upon the practices of the Social Security Administration, yet men would not have relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris.Statement 5a.  Accordingly, the court held that the</p>\n<p>"portion of the exception to the pension offset provision that requires a male applicant to prove that he received one-half of his economic support from his wife violates the equal protection guarantees of the due process clause of the fifth amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6a-7a (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Having invalidated the exception to the offset provision, the District Court considered the severability clause of \xc2\xa7 334(g)(3).  The court noted that, in the event appellee obtained a judgment that the offset exception unconstitutionally discriminates against him, the clause, if valid, would require nullification of the exception as to all persons, rather than extension of the exception to persons like appellee.  Consequently, all government retirees not covered by Social Security, without regard to gender or dependency, would have their spousal benefits offset by the amount of their government pensions.  The court characterized this effect of the severability clause as an effort by Congress</p>\n<p>"to mandate the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 465 U. S. 737</a></p><p> outcome of any challenge to the validity of the [pension offset] exception by making such a challenge fruitless.  Even if a plaintiff achieved success in having the gender-based classification stricken, he would derive no personal benefit from the decision, because the pension offset would be applied to all applicants without exception."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 8a.  Because of its view that Congress could not have meant to defeat the reliance interests of government retirees in that way, the court concluded</p>\n<p>"that the severability clause is not an expression of the true Congressional intent, but instead is an adroit attempt to discourage the bringing of an action by destroying standing."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the court held the severability provision unconstitutional and ordered the Secretary to pay Mathews and the rest of the plaintiff class full spousal benefits without regard to dependency and without offsetting the amount of their government pensions.  <em>Id.</em> at 9a.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Because it may affect our jurisdiction, <em>see Linda R. S. v. Richard D.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/614/case.html">410 U.

No. 95-837, p. 72 (1977); S.Conf.Rep. No. 95-612, p. 72 (1977), Congress exempted from the offset requirement those individuals eligible for spousal benefits under the Act "as it was in effect and being administered in January 1977."  There can be no dispute that,, in January, 1977, men were eligible for benefits only upon a showing of dependency whereas women were subject to no such requirement.  <em>See</em> former 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 402(c) and (f); <em>Califano v.

No. 95-612, <em>supra,</em> at 72.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the plain import of these provisions, Senator Long, then Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and principal manager of the bill in the Senate, explained that the exception clause was meant</p>\n<p>"to afford . . . protection to those who anticipated receiving their spouses benefits prior to March, 1977, <em>without providing it also to those [who] would qualify only as a result of [the </em>Goldfarb<em>] decision.</em>"</p>\n<p>123 Cong.Rec. 39134 (1977) (emphasis added).  <em>See also id.</em> at 39008 (remarks of Rep.

Appellee\'s proposed interpretation of the exception provision would defeat this clearly expressed intention and, by rendering the offset requirement applicable to very few applicants, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] frustrate the congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 465 U. S. 744</a></p><p> aim of preventing a major fiscal drain on the Social Security trust fund.  Accordingly, we reject appellee\'s construction of the Act and conclude that the exception to the offset provision applies to otherwise eligible men only when they can show dependency on their wives for one-half of their support.  We turn therefore to consider the constitutionality of that gender-based classification.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We recently reviewed the "firmly established principles" by which to evaluate a claim of gender discrimination like that made by appellee:</p>\n<p>"Our decisions . . . establish that the party seeking to uphold a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their gender must carry the burden of showing an \'exceedingly persuasive justification\' for the classification. . . .  The burden is met only by showing at least that the classification serves \'important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed\' are \'substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\' . . ."</p>\n<p>"Although the test for determining the validity of a gender-based classification is straightforward, it must be applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.  Care must be taken in ascertaining whether the statutory objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions.  Thus, if the statutory objective is to exclude or \'protect\' members of one gender because they are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate. . . ."</p>\n<p>"If the State\'s objective is legitimate and important, we next determine whether the requisite direct, substantial relationship between objective and means is present."</p>\n<p><em>Mississippi University for Women v.

[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>The provision at issue here, in contrast, reflects no such illegitimate government purposes.  As detailed above, Congress adopted the offset exception in order to protect the expectations of persons, both men and women, who had planned their retirements based on pre-January, 1977, law, under which they could receive spousal benefits unreduced by the amount of any government pensions to which they were also entitled.  Congress accomplished its aim by incorporating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 465 U. S. 746</a></p><p> the eligibility criteria as they existed in January, 1977; its choice of this approach, rather than an explicit adoption of new gender-based standards, confirms that its purpose was to protect reliance on prior law, not to reassert the sexist assumptions rejected in <em>Goldfarb.</em></p>\n<p>Nor is that purpose rendered illegitimate by the fact that it is achieved through a temporary revival of an invalidated classification.  We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time.  <em>See, e.g., Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

Although an unconstitutional scheme could not be retained for an unduly prolonged period in the name of protecting reliance interests, or even for a brief period if the expectations sought to be protected were themselves unreasonable or illegitimate, there is no indication that the offset exception suffers from either of these flaws.  The duration of the exception is closely related to its goal of protecting only individuals who had planned their retirements in reliance on prior law, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/728/case.html#748">465 U. S. 748</a></span>-749, and appellee does not suggest that the expectations of those individuals, who hardly could have anticipated the adoption of the offset requirement, were unreasonable or illegitimate.</p>\n<p>The protection of reasonable reliance interests is not only a legitimate governmental objective:  it provides "an exceedingly persuasive justification" for the statute at issue here.  <em>See Kirchberg v.

Instead, appellee contends that the only people who could justifiably have relied on an expectation of unreduced benefits are those who actually retired before the effective date of the offset provision, and those individuals will not be required to offset their benefits.  Brief for Appellees 28-29, and n. 21, 31-32.  Congress determined, however, that many individuals adjusted their spending and savings habits prior to their retirements in expectation of receiving full spousal benefits as well as a government pension, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and we have no reason to doubt that conclusion.  One commentator has explained:</p>\n<p>"Many couples have undoubtedly made retirement plans and adjusted the level of their private saving and investment in anticipation of retirement benefits from social security which include a special benefit for a spouse.  An abrupt denial of benefits in these cases, even if the spouse who would have received them is shown to be not truly dependent on the other, is clearly inequitable, since the couple\'s savings and retirement plans would have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 465 U. S. 748</a></p><p> been different had the spouse benefit not been anticipated.  Thus, were it to be decided that wives should prove dependency in order to receive spouse benefits, a strong argument could be made for making such a change gradually, so as to avoid inequities to couples approaching retirement who had anticipated that such benefits would be available to them and had made their retirement plans accordingly."</p>\n<p>M. Flowers, Women and Social Security:  An Institutional Dilemma 41 (1977).</p>\n<p>In short, particularly in the years immediately preceding retirement, individuals make spending, savings, and investment decisions based on assumptions regarding the amount of income they expect to receive after they stop working.  For such individuals, reliance on the law in effect during those years may be critically important. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In recognition of this fact, the offset exception, in the words of the Conference Report, protects</p>\n<p>"people who are already retired, or close to retirement, from public employment and who cannot be expected to readjust their retirement plans to take account of the \'offset\' provision that will apply in the future."</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep.

By reviving for a 5-year period the eligibility criteria in effect in January, 1977, the exception is narrowly tailored to protect only those individuals who made retirement plans prior to the changes in the law that occurred after that date.
