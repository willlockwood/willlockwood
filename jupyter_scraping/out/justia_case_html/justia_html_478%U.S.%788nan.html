The question presented is whether this finding is entitled to preclusive effect in federal court, where respondent has raised discrimination claims under various civil rights laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, <em>as amended,</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e <em>et seq.,</em> and 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1981, petitioner informed respondent, a black employee of the University\'s Agricultural Extension Service, that he would be discharged for inadequate work performance and misconduct on the job.  Respondent requested a hearing under the Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 4-5-101 <em>et seq.</em> (1985), to contest his proposed termination.  Prior to the start of the hearing, respondent also filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging that his proposed discharge was racially motivated and seeking relief under Title VII and other civil rights statutes, including 42 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="791">Page 478 U. S. 791</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The relief sought included damages, an injunction prohibiting respondent\'s discharge, and class-wide relief from alleged patterns of discrimination by petitioner.</p>\n<p>The District Court initially entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting the University from taking any job action against respondent, but later lifted this order and permitted the state administrative proceeding to go forward.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A27.  There followed a hearing at which an administrative assistant to the University\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="792">Page 478 U. S. 792</a></p><p> Vice President for Agriculture presided as an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  The focus of the hearing was on 10 particular charges that the University gave as grounds for respondent\'s discharge.  Respondent denied these charges, which he contended were motivated by racial prejudice, and also argued that the University\'s subjecting him to the charges violated his rights under the Constitution, Title VII, and other federal statutes.  The ALJ held that he lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate respondent\'s federal civil rights claims, but did allow respondent to present, as an affirmative defense, evidence that the charges against him were actually motivated by racial prejudice and hence not a proper basis for his proposed discharge.  <em>Id.</em> at A44-45.</p>\n<p>After hearing extensive evidence, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the ALJ found that the University had proved, some but not all, of the charges against respondent, and that the charges were not racially motivated.  <em>Id.</em> at A177-179.  Concluding that the proposed discharge of respondent was too severe a penalty, the ALJ ordered him transferred to a new assignment with supervisors other than those with whom he had experienced conflicts.  <em>Id.</em> at A179-181.  Respondent appealed to the University\'s Vice President for Agriculture, who affirmed the ALJ\'s ruling.  <em>Id.</em> at A33-35.  The Vice President stated that his review of the record persuaded him that the proposed discharge of respondent had not been racially motivated.  <em>Id.</em> at A34.</p>\n<p>Respondent did not seek review of these administrative proceedings in the Tennessee courts; instead, he returned to federal court to pursue his civil rights claims.  There, petitioner moved for summary judgment on the ground that respondent\'s suit was an improper collateral attack on the ALJ\'s ruling, which petitioner contended was entitled to preclusive effect.  The District Court agreed, holding that the civil rights statutes on which respondent relied "were not intended to afford the plaintiff a means of relitigating what plaintiff has heretofore litigated over a five-month period."  <em>Id.</em> at A32.</p>\n<p>Respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the District Court\'s judgment.  766 F.2d 982 (1985).  As regards respondent\'s Title VII claim, the Court of Appeals looked for guidance to our decision in <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/case.html">456 U. S. 461</a></span> (1982). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  While <em>Kremer</em> teaches that final state court judgments are entitled to full faith and credit in Title VII actions, it indicates that unreviewed determinations by state agencies stand on a different footing.  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="793">Page 478 U. S. 793</a></p><p> Sixth Circuit found the following passage from Kremer directly on point:</p>\n<p>"EEOC review [pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b)] of discrimination charges previously rejected by state agencies would be pointless if the federal courts were bound by such agency decisions.  <em>Batiste v. Furnco Constr. Corp.,</em> 503 F.2d 447, 450, n. 1 (CA7 1974), <em>cert. denied,</em> 420 U.S. 928 (1975).  Nor is it plausible to suggest that Congress intended federal courts to be bound further by state administrative decisions than by decisions of the EEOC.  Since it is settled that decisions by the EEOC do not preclude a trial <em>de novo</em> in federal court, it is clear that unreviewed administrative determinations by state agencies also should not preclude such review even if such a decision were to be afforded preclusive effect in a State\'s own courts.  <em>Garner v. Giarrusso,</em> 571 F.2d 1330 (CA5 1978); <em>Batiste v. Furnco Constr. Corp., supra; Cooper v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</em> 464 F.2d 9 (CA6 1972); <em>Voutsis v. Union Carbide Corp.,</em> 452 F.2d 889 (CA2 1971), <em>cert. denied,</em> 406 U.S. 918 (1972)."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 470, n. 7.  The court accordingly held that <em>res judicata</em> did not foreclose a trial <em>de novo</em> on respondent\'s Title VII claim.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit found the question of applying preclusion principles to respondent\'s claims under \xc2\xa7 1983 and other civil rights statutes a more difficult question.  It held that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which concerns the preclusive effect of "judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="794">Page 478 U. S. 794</a></p><p> proceedings of any [state] court," does not require that federal courts be bound by the unreviewed findings of state administrative agencies.  The court also declined to fashion a federal common law of preclusion, declaring that</p>\n<p>"[a]t least implicit in the legislative history of section 1983 is the recognition that state determination of issues relevant to constitutional adjudication is not an adequate substitute for full access to federal court."</p>\n<p>766 F.2d at 992.  The court recognized that a similar argument for denying <em>res judicata</em> effect to state court judgments in subsequent \xc2\xa7 1983 actions was rejected in <em>Allen v. McCurry,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html">449 U. S. 90</a></span> (1980), and <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/75/case.html">465 U. S. 75</a></span> (1984), but distinguished those cases as based on the explicit command of \xc2\xa7 1738.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to consider petitioner\'s contention that the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that state administrative factfinding is never entitled to preclusive effect in actions under Title VII or the Reconstruction civil rights statutes.  474 U.S. 1004 (1985).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738 governs the preclusive effect to be given the judgments and records of state courts, and is not applicable to the unreviewed state administrative factfinding at issue in this case.  However, we have frequently fashioned federal common law rules of preclusion in the absence of a governing statute.  <em>See, e.g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/322/case.html">439 U. S. 322</a></span> (1979); <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v.

S. 795</a></p><p> regard to the judgments and records of state courts, because \xc2\xa7 1738 antedates the development of administrative agencies, it clearly does not represent a congressional determination that the decisions of state administrative agencies should not be given preclusive effect.  Accordingly, we will consider whether a rule of preclusion is appropriate, first with respect to respondent\'s Title VII claim, and next with respect to his claims under the Constitution and the Reconstruction civil rights statutes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in investigating discrimination charges, must give</p>\n<p>"substantial weight to final findings and orders made by State or local authorities in proceedings commenced under State or local [employment discrimination] law."</p>\n<p>As we noted in <em>Kremer,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/461/case.html#470">456 U. S. 470</a></span>, n. 7, it would make little sense for Congress to write such a provision if state agency findings were entitled to preclusive effect in Title VII actions in federal court.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our decision in <em>Chandler v. Roudebush,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/840/case.html">425 U. S. 840</a></span> (1976), strongly supports respondent\'s contention that Congress intended one in his position to have a trial <em>de novo</em> on his Title VII claim.  In <em>Chandler,</em> we held that a federal employee whose discrimination claim was rejected by her employing agency after an administrative hearing was entitled to a trial <em>de novo</em> in federal court on her Title VII claim.  After reviewing in considerable detail the language of Title VII and the history of the 1972 amendments to the statute, we concluded:</p>\n<p>"The legislative history of the 1972 amendments reinforces the plain meaning of the statute, and confirms that Congress intended to accord federal employees the same right to a trial <em>de novo</em> [following administrative proceedings] as is enjoyed by private-sector employees and employees of state governments and political subdivisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="796">Page 478 U.

S. 848</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Like the plaintiff in <em>Chandler,</em> the respondent in this case pursued his Title VII action following an administrative proceeding at which the employing agency rejected a discrimination claim.  It would be contrary to the rationale of <em>Chandler</em> to apply <em>res judicata</em> to deny respondent a trial <em>de novo</em> on his Title VII claim.</p>\n<p>Invoking the presumption against implied repeal, petitioner distinguishes <em>Chandler</em> as involving a federal agency determination not entitled to full faith and credit under \xc2\xa7 1738.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.  This argument is based on the erroneous premise that \xc2\xa7 1738 applies to state administrative proceedings.  <em>See</em> Part II, <em>supra.</em>  The question actually before us is whether a common law rule of preclusion would be consistent with Congress\' intent in enacting Title VII.  On the basis of our analysis in <em>Kremer</em> and <em>Chandler</em> of the language and legislative history of Title VII, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit correctly held that Congress did not intend unreviewed state administrative proceedings to have preclusive effect on Title VII claims. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>This Court has held that \xc2\xa7 1738 requires that state court judgments be given both issue and claim preclusive effect in subsequent actions under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983.  <em>Allen v. McCurry, supra,</em> (issue preclusion); <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, supra,</em> (claim preclusion).  Those decisions are not controlling in this case, where \xc2\xa7 1738 does not apply; nonetheless, they support the view that Congress, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="797">Page 478 U. S. 797</a></p><p> in enacting the Reconstruction civil rights statutes, did not intend to create an exception to general rules of preclusion.  As we stated in <em>Allen:</em></p>\n<p>"[N]othing in the language of \xc2\xa7 1983 remotely expresses any congressional intent to contravene the common law rules of preclusion or to repeal the express statutory requirements of the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738. . . ."</p>\n<p>"Moreover, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 does not in any clear way suggest that Congress intended to repeal or restrict the traditional doctrines of preclusion."</p>\n<p>449 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/90/case.html#97">449 U. S. 97</a></span>-98.  The Court\'s discussion in <em>Allen</em> suggests that it would have reached the same result even in the absence of \xc2\xa7 1738.  We also see no reason to suppose that Congress, in enacting the Reconstruction civil rights statutes, wished to foreclose the adaptation of traditional principles of preclusion to such subsequent developments as the burgeoning use of administrative adjudication in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>We have previously recognized that it is sound policy to apply principles of issue preclusion to the factfinding of administrative bodies acting in a judicial capacity.  In a unanimous decision in <em>United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/394/case.html">384 U. S. 394</a></span> (1966), we held that the factfinding of the Advisory Board of Contract Appeals was binding in a subsequent action in the Court of Claims involving a contract dispute between the same parties.  We explained:</p>\n<p>"Although the decision here rests upon the agreement of the parties as modified by the Wunderlich Act, we note that the result we reach is harmonious with general principles of collateral estoppel.  Occasionally courts have used language to the effect that <em>res judicata</em> principles do not apply to administrative proceedings, but such language is certainly too broad.  When an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves </p><p><a class="page-number" name="798">Page 478 U. S. 798</a></p><p> disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply <em>res judicata</em> to enforce repose."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/394/case.html#421">384 U.

The Full Faith and Credit Clause is, of course, not binding on federal courts, but we can certainly look to the policies underlying the Clause in fashioning federal common law rules of preclusion.  "Perhaps the major purpose of the Full Faith and Credit Clause is to act as a nationally unifying force," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/261/case.html#289">448 U.

The state agency rejected the employee\'s discrimination claim, a judgment that was affirmed both at the agency appellate level and by a reviewing state court.

These contentions were not passed upon below, and we leave them for resolution on remand.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>An administrative assistant to the Vice President for Agriculture of the University of Tennessee conducted a hearing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="800">Page 478 U. S. 800</a></p><p> and determined that respondent\'s proposed discharge was not racially motivated.  The Court today correctly holds that 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1738 does not require that this determination by an administrative assistant be given full faith and credit in subsequent federal litigation.  The Court also correctly refuses to fashion a federal common law rule of preclusion that would bar respondent from litigating his claim against the University under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  I agree with these conclusions, and therefore join Parts I, II, and III of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>In Part IV of its opinion, however, the Court concludes that the findings of the administrative assistant may bar respondent\'s claims under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and other of the Reconstruction-era Civil Rights Acts.  Although its reading of the legislative history of the 1964 Civil Rights Act persuades the Court that it should not interpose a judicially created bar to the cause of action authorized by that statute, it creates such a bar to claims authorized by the earlier Civil Rights Acts without even mentioning the concerns that prompted their enactment.  As a consequence, the Court\'s analysis is incomplete, and ultimately unconvincing.</p>\n<p>Preclusion of claims brought under the post-Civil War Acts does not advance the objectives typically associated with finality or federalism.  In the employment setting which concerns us here, precluding civil rights claims based on the Reconstruction-era statutes fails to conserve the resources of either the litigants or the courts, because the complainant\'s companion Title VII claim will still go to federal court under today\'s decision. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Nor does preclusion show respect for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="801">Page 478 U. S. 801</a></p><p> state administrative determinations, because litigants apprised of this decision will presumably forgo state administrative determinations for the same reason they currently forgo state judicial review of those determinations -- to protect their entitlement to a federal forum.  <em>Cf.

In <em>Utah Construction,</em> the Court held that, in a dispute arising under a Government contract, factual findings by the Board of Contract Appeals were binding on the Court of Claims.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The relevant federal statute in this case is the 1871 Civil Rights Act, not the Wunderlich Act.  Needless to say, there is nothing in the legislative history of the post-Civil War legislation remotely suggesting that Congress intended to give binding effect to unreviewed rulings by state administrators in litigation arising under that statute.

Due respect for the intent of the Congress that enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871, as revealed in the voluminous legislative history of that Act, should preclude the Court from creating a judge-made rule that bars access to the express legislative remedy enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part IV of the Court\'s opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"The difficulties that will be encountered with this schizophrenic approach [ruling that state administrative findings may establish preclusion as to the claims under these Civil Rights Acts, at the same time as the same issues are relitigated as to the Title VII claim] are obvious.  A way out of these difficulties remains to be found.  As to any issues that must be retried, with perhaps inconsistent results, it may prove better simply to retry the issues as to all statutory claims.  Application of preclusion as to part of the case saves no effort, does not prevent the risk of inconsistent findings, and may distort the process of finding the issues.  The opportunity for repose is substantially weakened by the remaining exposure to liability.  Insistence on preclusion in these circumstances has little value, and more risk than it may be worth."</p>\n<p>18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E.

The court is reluctant, however, to apply that principle to these administrative findings because of the nature and genesis of the boards.  The Wunderlich Act, as applied in <em>Bianchi,</em> should dispel these doubts.  The Supreme Court made it plain that Congress intended the boards (and like administrative representatives) to be the factfinders within their contract area of competence, just as the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board are the factfinders for other purposes.  In the light of <em>Bianchi\'s</em> evaluation of the statutory policy, we should not squint to give a crabbed reading to the board\'s authority where it has stayed within its sphere, but should accept it as the primary factfinding tribunal whose factual determinations (in disputes under the contract) must be received, if valid, in the same way as those of other courts or of the independent administrative agencies.  Under the more modern view, the findings of the latter, at least when acting in an adjudicatory capacity, are considered final, even in a suit not directly related to the administrative proceeding, unless there is some good reason for a new Judicial inquiry into the same facts.  <em>See</em> Davis, Administrative Law 566 (1951); <em>Fairmont Aluminum Co. v. Commissioner,</em> 222 F.2d 622, 627 (4th Cir.1955).  The only reasons the majority now offers for a Judicial retrial of factual questions already determined by valid board findings are the same policy considerations which Congress and the Supreme Court have already discarded in the Wunderlich Act and the <em>Bianchi</em> opinion.
