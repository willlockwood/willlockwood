He first filed suit against the United States, alleging that a severe beating he received from a fellow inmate was the result of negligence by prison officials.  The Government treated the suit as a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346(b), \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171\xe2\x80\x9d of Title 28.  But an \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section of the FTCA dictates that \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of [Chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this title .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to certain categories of claims.  The Government moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the claim fell into the exception for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim based upon .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the exercise or performance .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [of] a discretionary function,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, deciding where to house inmates, \xc2\xa72680(a).  While the motion was pending, Himmelreich filed a second suit: a constitutional tort suit against individual Bureau of Prison employees, again alleging that his beating was the result of prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 negligence.  Ordinarily, the FTCA would have no bearing on that claim.  But after the dismissal of Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit, the individual employee defendants argued that Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s second suit was foreclosed by the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s judgment bar provision, according to which a judgment in an FTCA suit forecloses any future suit against individual employees.  Agreeing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison employees.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, however, holding that the judgment bar provision did not apply to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s suit.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The judgment bar provision does not apply to the claims dismissed for falling within the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section of the FTCA.

If, as the Government maintains, Chapter 171\xe2\x80\x99s judgment bar provision applies to claims in that \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d category, it applied to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit and would preclude any future actions, including his second suit.

The FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section reads: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he provisions of this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chapter 171\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The judgment bar is a provision of Chapter 171.

Because the judgment bar provision does not apply to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit, his second suit\xe2\x80\x94against individual prison employees\xe2\x80\x94should be permitted to go forward.  Nothing about the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section or the judgment bar provision gives this Court any reason to disregard the plain text of the statute.

There, the Court found that the exclusive remedies provision of Chapter 171\xe2\x80\x94which prevents a plaintiff from suing an employee where the FTCA would allow him to sue the United States instead, see \xc2\xa72679(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94applied to a claim for injuries sustained at a hospital in Italy, even though that claim fell within the category of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of [Chapter 171] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not apply,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(k).  <i>Smith</i>\xe2\x80\x99s outcome, the Government argues, forecloses a literal reading of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d provision, but <i>Smith </i>does not control here.  First, <i>Smith</i> does not even mention the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d language.  Second, the exclusive remedies provision at issue there was enacted as part of the Federal Employee Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, which also contained a mechanism to convert tort suits against Government employees into FTCA suits \xe2\x80\x9csubject to the <i>limitations and exceptions</i> applicable to those actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 166 (quoting \xc2\xa72679(d)(4); emphasis in <i>Smith</i>).  By taking note of those \xe2\x80\x9climitations and exceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d the <i>Smith</i> Court reasoned, the Liability Reform Act was intended to apply to the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d categories of claims.  Nothing in the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same result here.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s remaining counterargument is a parade of horribles that it believes will come to pass if every provision of Chapter 171 \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d categories of claims, but it raises few concerns about the judgment bar provision itself.  If the Government is right about Chapter 171\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions, the Court may hold so in the appropriate case, see <i>Smith</i>, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175, but the reading adopted here yields utterly sensible results.  Had the District Court in this case issued a judgment dismissing Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit because, <i>e.g.,</i> the prison employees were not negligent, it would make sense that the judgment bar provision would prevent a second suit against the employees.  But where an FTCA claim is dismissed because it falls within one of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d the dismissal signals merely that the United States cannot be held liable for a particular claim; it has no logical bearing on whether an employee can be liable instead.

In each, Himmelreich alleged that he had been severely beaten by a fellow inmate in federal prison and that the beating was the result of prison officials\xe2\x80\x99 negligence.  At the time of the beating, Himmelreich was incarcerated for producing child pornography.

Ordinarily, the FTCA would have nothing to say about such claims.

See \xc2\xa72676.  As relevant here, the District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison employees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Himmelreich appealed that ruling.

The Government maintains that the judgment bar provision does apply to such claims.  In that case, it applied to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit and would preclude any future actions, including his second suit.  Himmelreich urges that it does not apply.  On that reading, there is no reason he cannot proceed with his second suit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Himmelreich is correct.  The \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section of the FTCA reads: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he provisions of this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Chapter 171\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

The judgment bar is a provision of Chapter 171; the plain text of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section therefore dictates that it does \xe2\x80\x9cnot apply\xe2\x80\x9d to cases that, like Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit, are based on the performance of a discretionary function.  Because the judgment bar provision does not apply to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit, Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s second suit\xe2\x80\x94the one against individual prison employees\xe2\x80\x94should be permitted to go forward.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Absent persuasive indications to the contrary, we presume Congress says what it means and means what it says.  Nothing about the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section or the judgment bar provision gives us any reason to doubt the plain-text result in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Given the clarity of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section\xe2\x80\x99s command, a reader might be forgiven for wondering how there could be any confusion about the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  The main source of uncertainty on this score, the Government submits, is <i>United States</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,\n\n499 U. S. 160 (1991)\n.  In <i>Smith</i>, we considered another provision of Chapter 171, the exclusive remedies provision.  <i>Id</i>., at 162.  Under the exclusive remedies provision, a plaintiff generally cannot sue an employee where the FTCA would allow him to sue the United States instead.  See \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Smith</i> Court held that this exclusive remedies provision applied to a claim for injuries sustained at an Army hospital in Italy, even though that claim fell within the category of \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to which \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of [Chapter 171] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72680(k).  The Government argues that our literal reading of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d provision would foreclose <i>Smith</i>\xe2\x80\x99s outcome because the <i>Smith</i> Court applied a provision of Chapter 171 (the exclusive remedies provision) to a claim falling within one of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d categories (a claim arising in a foreign country).  <i>Smith</i>, the Government argues, thus establishes that we cannot read the command of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section literally and that the judgment bar provision therefore should apply to Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary function claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position has some force.  Nonetheless, <i>Smith</i> does not control this case.  First, <i>Smith</i> does not even cite, let alone discuss, the \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d language \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  Second, the exclusive remedies provision at issue in <i>Smith</i> was enacted as part of the Federal Employee Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, which contained a mechanism to reduce the number of tort suits against Government employees.  As the <i>Smith</i> Court explained, if \xe2\x80\x9cthe Attorney General . . . certif[ies] that a Government employee named as defendant was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the alleged tort,\xe2\x80\x9d the Liability Reform Act dictates that the United States be substituted as the sole defendant, and that the action \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall proceed in the same manner\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as an FTCA action \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98and shall be subject to the <i>limitations and exceptions</i> applicable to those actions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U. S., at 166 (quoting \xc2\xa72679(d)(4)); (emphasis in <i>Smith</i>).  The <i>Smith</i> Court held that the Liability Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9climitations and exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d was most naturally read to refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section of the FTCA.  And by taking note of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section, the <i>Smith</i> court reasoned, the Liability Reform Act was intended to apply to those \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of the unique language of the Liability Reform Act, <i>Smith</i> is distinguishable from this case.  Nothing in the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same result.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s remaining counterargument amounts to a parade of horribles that it believes will come to pass if <i>every</i> provision of Chapter 171 \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d categories of claims.  See Brief for Petitioners 52.  If the Government is right about the other provisions of Chapter 171, the Court may hold so in the appropriate case.  See <i>Smith</i>, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175.  But this case deals only with the judgment bar provision, and, aside from a passing concern about duplicative litigation, the Government does not argue that any such cavalcade would follow if <i>that</i> provision does not apply to the excepted claims.  It is enough for our purposes that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s clear directive would not lead to hard-to-explain results when applied to the judgment bar provision in particular.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the contrary, our holding that the judgment bar provision \xe2\x80\x9cshall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the categories of claims in the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section in fact allows the statute to operate in an utterly sensible manner.  Ordinarily, the judgment bar provision prevents unnecessarily duplicative litigation.  If the District Court in this case had issued a judgment dismissing Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit because the prison employees were not negligent, because Himmelreich was not harmed, or because Himmelreich simply failed to prove his claim, it would make little sense to give Himmelreich a second bite at the money-damages apple by allowing suit against the employees: Himmelreich\xe2\x80\x99s first suit would have given him a fair chance to recover dam-ages for his beating.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Where an FTCA claim is dismissed because it falls within one of the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d by contrast, the judgment bar provision makes much less sense.  The dismissal of a claim in the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d section signals merely that the United States cannot be held liable for a particular claim; it has no logical bearing on whether an employee can be held liable instead.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  To apply the judgment bar so as to foreclose a future suit against an employee thus would be passing strange.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would yield another strange result.  According to the Government, the viability of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s meritorious suit against an individual employee should turn on the order in which the suits are filed (or the order in which the district court chooses to address motions).  For example, had the District Court in this case addressed the individual employee suit first, there would be no FTCA judgment in the picture, and so the judgment bar provision would not affect the outcome of the suit.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would thus encourage litigants to file suit against individual employees before suing the United States to avoid being foreclosed from recovery altogether.  Yet this result is at odds with one of the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, channeling liability away from individual employees and toward the United States.  See <i>Dalehite</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 15,\n25 (1953)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We decline to ignore the text of the statute to achieve these imprudently restrictive results.  Accordingly, we read \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he provisions of this chapter .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall not apply\xe2\x80\x9d as it was written.  The judgment bar provision\xe2\x80\x94one of the \xe2\x80\x9cprovisions of this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94does not apply to the categories of claims in the \xe2\x80\x9cExceptions\xe2\x80\x9d sections of the FTCA.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See <i>Hallock </i>v. <i>Bonner</i>, 387 F.\xc2\xa03d 147 (CA2 2004), vacated on other<i> </i>grounds<i> sub\xc2\xa0nom.

(The judgment bar provision supplements common-law claim preclusion by closing a narrow gap: At the time that the FTCA was passed, common-law claim preclusion would have barred a plaintiff from suing the United States after having sued an employee but not vice versa.  See Restatement of Judgments \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa799, 96(1)(a), Comments <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> (1942).
