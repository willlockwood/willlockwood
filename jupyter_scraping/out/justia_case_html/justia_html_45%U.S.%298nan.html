The bill prayed that Collier and Smith and all the securities might be made defendants to answer, and that the property might be sold to pay the judgment obtained by the complainants.</p>\n<p>Some of the defendants demurred to the bill, but the demurrers were overruled, and they were ordered to answer.</p>\n<p>On 10 November, 1841, the Chancery Court at Brownsville passed the following decree in the case of the bill which had been filed by Peyton Smith, and in which he had obtained an injunction, as before stated.</p>\n<p>"Be it remembered, that this cause came on to be heard on this, the tenth day of November, eighteen hundred and forty-one, before the Hon. A. McCampbell chancellor, upon the orders <em>pro confesso</em> against said defendants.  And it appearing to the satisfaction of the court that in March, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, defendant Collier made a deed conveying to complainant, amongst other things, the following negro slaves, to-wit:  Jack, Jim, Washington, Margaret, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryan, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Sam, John, Lucinda, and Cynthia, which said deed was executed by said Collier to complainant in trust to secure the payment of certain debts in the same specified; and by the terms of said deed said Collier was to remain in possession of the property conveyed in the same for the space of eighteen months from and after the execution of said deed, and in the event that the debts specified in said deed were not paid on or before the expiration of the eighteen months from the time of the execution of said deed, the property specified in the same was to be sold by complainant, and the proceeds arising from said sale to be applied by him to the liquidation and settlement of the debts set forth in said deed."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing, that said deed was duly proven and registered, and that the debts specified in said deed are <em>bona fide,</em> and due and owing, with the exception of about five hundred dollars, which has been paid by said Collier since the execution of said deed, and that said deed was executed in good faith, and there is no fraud in the same."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that after </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 45 U. S. 304</a></p><p> the execution, probate, and registration of said deed, defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co. recovered a judgment in the District Court of the United States, in the Eighth Circuit, for the State of Tennessee, at Jackson, for about the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents; upon which said judgment a writ of <em>fieri facias</em> issued to defendant Chester; who, by virtue of said writ of <em>fieri facias,</em> seized and took into his possession said negro slaves, Jack, Jim, Washington, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Cynthia, Sam, John, and Lucinda, and that defendant Chester was about to sell and dispose of said negroes slaves."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that defendants acquired no lien on any of said several negroes slaves by virtue of their said judgment and execution, and that said slaves ought not to be appropriated in satisfaction of the same."</p>\n<p>"It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the injunction heretofore awarded in this cause be made perpetual, and that said defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co., and said Robert J. Chester, be, and are hereby, restrained perpetually from selling or otherwise controlling either of said slaves under and by virtue of said judgment and execution."</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered, that the Sheriff of Tipton County deliver said negroes over to complainant; that complainant pay all costs herein expended, for which execution may issue.  And that complainant recover of defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co., and Robert J. Chester, the costs of suit herein expended, and that defendant Collier recover of complainant the cost by him about this suit expended, for which executions may issue."</p>\n<p>In April, 1842, the respondents answered the bill filed by Knox, Boggs &amp; Co. in the district court.  It will only be necessary to refer to the answers of Smith and Collier.  Smith denied that the deed of trust made to him was fraudulent as against creditors, but averred that the same was made in good faith; that he was governed by no other feeling or desire than a wish to discharge his duty as trustee; that the <em>cestui que trust</em> looked to him to protect the property; denied all combination and confederation with any person &amp;c.  Collier admitted the truth of the facts as they are set forth in the preceding part of this statement, denied that the deed to Smith was fraudulent, but averred that it was made in good faith &amp;c.</p>\n<p>In May, 1842, a general replication was filed by the complainants.</p>\n<p>On 5 August, 1842, interrogatories were filed on the part of the complainants and the depositions of four person taken.  Chester, the marshal, was asked to state the value of the property conveyed by the deed of trust, to which he answered as follows.</p>\n<p>"<em>Answer.</em>  I believe, from the ages &amp;c., of the negroes mentioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 45 U. S. 305</a></p><p> in the deed of trust and what I saw of them when delivered to me that they were worth, at the date of conveyance, seven to eight thousand dollars; I do not know what the mules and horses are worth, nor am I acquainted with the value of the land or the town lots."</p>\n<p>Harris and Smith answered as follows.</p>\n<p>"<em>Answer.</em>  I, J. W. Harris have examined the deed referred to in said interrogatory, and suppose the negroes, judging from their age and size, as stated in said deed of trust, to have been worth, at the date of said deed, seven thousand six hundred and fifty dollars; not being personally acquainted with but few of them, can only state their value from what appears to be their ages in the deed.  Horses and mules supposed to be worth four hundred dollars; household and kitchen furniture supposed to be worth four hundred and eleven dollars, including spinning machine, barouche, blacksmith\'s tools, and loom.  As to the land, I have no idea what it was worth, never having been upon it that I know of, and not being acquainted with the value of land."</p>\n<p>"I, A. W. Smith, answer and say that I am acquainted with the property conveyed in the deed mentioned in the above interrogatory, and believe it to have been worth, at the date of the said deed, ten thousand three hundred and sixty-six dollars."</p>\n<p>Clarkson was interrogated as to the amount which Collier owed to him, to which he responded, that it was a balance of eleven or twelve hundred dollars.</p>\n<p>On 16 October, 1843, the cause came on to be heard on bill, answers, replication, and proof, when the bill was dismissed with costs.  From which decree an appeal brought the case up to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 45 U.

P. Collier, and Robert J. Chester, defendants, to be relieved touching the matters therein complained of, in which said bill it is, among other matters, set forth, that the said defendants are combining and confederating to injure the complainant touching the matters set forth in said bill, and that their actings and doings in that behalf are contrary to equity and good conscience."</p>\n<p>"We therefore, in consideration of the premises, do strictly command you, the said Sheriff of Tipton County, Tennessee, that you do absolutely seize and take into your possession, immediately and forthwith, at all hazards, the following negro slaves, to-wit:  Jack, Jim, Jane, Marcella, Zilpha, Washington, Margaret, Doll, Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Cynthia, Sam, John, Clara, and Lucinda, heretofore levied on by the marshal of West Tennessee, as the property of said Collier, to satisfy a judgment in favor of said Knox, Boggs &amp; Co.; and do you safely and securely keep said slaves, so that you have them forthcoming to abide the further order of our said chancery court; and this you shall in no wise omit, under the penalty prescribed by law."</p>\n<p>"Witness, Sheppard M.

S. 303</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On 8 April, 1841, Knox, Boggs &amp; Co. filed a bill in the district court of the United States (the same court in which they had obtained their judgment), reciting all the circumstances of the case, stating that Smith claimed under a fraudulent deed of trust, and alleging that a state court had no right, power, or jurisdiction to enjoin the process issued from the district court; that Collier and the securities upon the delivery bond combined and confederated with Peyton Smith to prevent the sale of the property levied upon, and so defeat the execution of the complainants, who had now no adequate and complete remedy at law.  The bill prayed that Collier and Smith and all the securities might be made defendants to answer, and that the property might be sold to pay the judgment obtained by the complainants.</p>\n<p>Some of the defendants demurred to the bill, but the demurrers were overruled, and they were ordered to answer.</p>\n<p>On 10 November, 1841, the Chancery Court at Brownsville passed the following decree in the case of the bill which had been filed by Peyton Smith, and in which he had obtained an injunction, as before stated.</p>\n<p>"Be it remembered, that this cause came on to be heard on this, the tenth day of November, eighteen hundred and forty-one, before the Hon. A. McCampbell chancellor, upon the orders <em>pro confesso</em> against said defendants.  And it appearing to the satisfaction of the court that in March, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, defendant Collier made a deed conveying to complainant, amongst other things, the following negro slaves, to-wit:  Jack, Jim, Washington, Margaret, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryan, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Sam, John, Lucinda, and Cynthia, which said deed was executed by said Collier to complainant in trust to secure the payment of certain debts in the same specified; and by the terms of said deed said Collier was to remain in possession of the property conveyed in the same for the space of eighteen months from and after the execution of said deed, and in the event that the debts specified in said deed were not paid on or before the expiration of the eighteen months from the time of the execution of said deed, the property specified in the same was to be sold by complainant, and the proceeds arising from said sale to be applied by him to the liquidation and settlement of the debts set forth in said deed."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing, that said deed was duly proven and registered, and that the debts specified in said deed are <em>bona fide,</em> and due and owing, with the exception of about five hundred dollars, which has been paid by said Collier since the execution of said deed, and that said deed was executed in good faith, and there is no fraud in the same."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that after </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 45 U. S. 304</a></p><p> the execution, probate, and registration of said deed, defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co. recovered a judgment in the District Court of the United States, in the Eighth Circuit, for the State of Tennessee, at Jackson, for about the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents; upon which said judgment a writ of <em>fieri facias</em> issued to defendant Chester; who, by virtue of said writ of <em>fieri facias,</em> seized and took into his possession said negro slaves, Jack, Jim, Washington, Doll, Marcella, Zilpha, Bryant, Toney, Catharine, Cully, Chloe, Phillis, Cynthia, Sam, John, and Lucinda, and that defendant Chester was about to sell and dispose of said negroes slaves."</p>\n<p>"And it further appearing to the satisfaction of the court, that defendants acquired no lien on any of said several negroes slaves by virtue of their said judgment and execution, and that said slaves ought not to be appropriated in satisfaction of the same."</p>\n<p>"It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the injunction heretofore awarded in this cause be made perpetual, and that said defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co., and said Robert J. Chester, be, and are hereby, restrained perpetually from selling or otherwise controlling either of said slaves under and by virtue of said judgment and execution."</p>\n<p>"It is further ordered, that the Sheriff of Tipton County deliver said negroes over to complainant; that complainant pay all costs herein expended, for which execution may issue.  And that complainant recover of defendants Knox, Boggs &amp; Co., and Robert J. Chester, the costs of suit herein expended, and that defendant Collier recover of complainant the cost by him about this suit expended, for which executions may issue."</p>\n<p>In April, 1842, the respondents answered the bill filed by Knox, Boggs &amp; Co. in the district court.  It will only be necessary to refer to the answers of Smith and Collier.  Smith denied that the deed of trust made to him was fraudulent as against creditors, but averred that the same was made in good faith; that he was governed by no other feeling or desire than a wish to discharge his duty as trustee; that the <em>cestui que trust</em> looked to him to protect the property; denied all combination and confederation with any person &amp;c.  Collier admitted the truth of the facts as they are set forth in the preceding part of this statement, denied that the deed to Smith was fraudulent, but averred that it was made in good faith &amp;c.</p>\n<p>In May, 1842, a general replication was filed by the complainants.</p>\n<p>On 5 August, 1842, interrogatories were filed on the part of the complainants and the depositions of four person taken.  Chester, the marshal, was asked to state the value of the property conveyed by the deed of trust, to which he answered as follows.</p>\n<p>"<em>Answer.</em>  I believe, from the ages &amp;c., of the negroes mentioned </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 45 U. S. 305</a></p><p> in the deed of trust and what I saw of them when delivered to me that they were worth, at the date of conveyance, seven to eight thousand dollars; I do not know what the mules and horses are worth, nor am I acquainted with the value of the land or the town lots."</p>\n<p>Harris and Smith answered as follows.</p>\n<p>"<em>Answer.</em>  I, J. W. Harris have examined the deed referred to in said interrogatory, and suppose the negroes, judging from their age and size, as stated in said deed of trust, to have been worth, at the date of said deed, seven thousand six hundred and fifty dollars; not being personally acquainted with but few of them, can only state their value from what appears to be their ages in the deed.  Horses and mules supposed to be worth four hundred dollars; household and kitchen furniture supposed to be worth four hundred and eleven dollars, including spinning machine, barouche, blacksmith\'s tools, and loom.  As to the land, I have no idea what it was worth, never having been upon it that I know of, and not being acquainted with the value of land."</p>\n<p>"I, A. W. Smith, answer and say that I am acquainted with the property conveyed in the deed mentioned in the above interrogatory, and believe it to have been worth, at the date of the said deed, ten thousand three hundred and sixty-six dollars."</p>\n<p>Clarkson was interrogated as to the amount which Collier owed to him, to which he responded, that it was a balance of eleven or twelve hundred dollars.</p>\n<p>On 16 October, 1843, the cause came on to be heard on bill, answers, replication, and proof, when the bill was dismissed with costs.  From which decree an appeal brought the case up to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 45 U. S. 316</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McLEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In their bill, the complainants state that they recovered a judgment in the circuit court against Thomas Eckford and Probert P. Collier, for the sum of three thousand four hundred and sixty-two dollars and twenty cents &amp;c., and that execution was issued 24 April, 1840, which, about 18 July ensuing, was levied on seventeen negroes and four mules, and that the marshal took a delivery bond and security, under the statute of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>That one Peyton Smith, a citizen of the State of Tennessee, pretending to claim said property levied upon by virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust executed by Probert P. Collier to him, filed a bill, which prayed for an injunction, in the circuit court, and which was refused.  That the delivery bond being forfeited, an execution was issued on it, against the principals and sureties, which was levied upon the same negroes and mules, upon which execution the marshal returned that "the property levied on had been taken from him by the Sheriff of Tipton County, under the order of the Chancery Court at Brownsville, 5 December, 1840."  The bill alleges that the negroes and mules belonged to Collier, and it prays that they may be sold in satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p>There is no allegation in this bill which authorizes a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the case.  Fraud is not charged, nor is anything stated going to show that the remedy at law is not complete.  It is stated that Peyton Smith, pretending to claim the property, after the first levy by virtue of some fraudulent deed of trust executed to him by Collier, applied to the circuit court by bill for an injunction, which was refused.  The present bill was not filed by the complainants until after execution was issued on the delivery bond and levied, and the property was taken, as returned by the marshal, under state process.</p>\n<p>Now if the object had been to set aside the deed of trust as fraudulent, the fraud, with the facts connected with it, should have been alleged in the bill.  Or if the negroes and mules were about to be taken out of the state and beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless restrained by an injunction, such fact should have been stated.  But the principal allegation in the bill is that under the state authority, the sheriff had no right to take the negroes &amp;c.  If this be admitted, it does not follow that the remedy of the complainants is in a court of equity.  On the contrary, from the showing in the bill, there is a plain remedy at law.  The marshal might </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 45 U. S. 317</a></p><p> have brought trespass against the sheriff or applied to the circuit court for an attachment.</p>\n<p>Out of the answer which sets up the deed of trust, the complainants insist they are entitled to relief.  Now no relief can be given by a court of equity, except a proper case be made in the bill.  The inquiry is not only whether the defendant, from his own showing or by proof, has acted unjustly and inequitably, but also whether the complainants, by their allegations and proof, have shown that they are entitled to relief.</p>\n<p><em>The decree of the circuit court is affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
