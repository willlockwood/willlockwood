The District Court granted respondents judgment on the pleadings, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Russell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/index.html">473 U. S. 134</a>, the Circuit held that ERISA \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) provides remedies only for entire plans, not for individuals.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Although \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries, it does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant\xe2\x80\x99s individual account.  Section 502(a)(2) provides for suits to enforce the liability-creating provisions of \xc2\xa7409, concerning breaches of fiduciary duties that harm plans.  The principal statutory duties imposed by \xc2\xa7409 relate to the proper management, administration, and investment of plan assets, with an eye toward ensuring that the benefits authorized by the plan are ultimately paid to plan participants.  The misconduct that petitioner alleges falls squarely within that category, unlike the misconduct in <em>Russell</em>.  There, the plaintiff received all of the benefits to which she was contractually entitled, but sought consequential damages arising from a delay in the processing of her claim.  <em>Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on protecting the \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d reflects the fact that the disability plan in <em>Russell,</em> as well as the typical pension plan at that time, promised participants a fixed benefit.  Misconduct by such a plan\xe2\x80\x99s administrators will not affect an individual\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan.  For defined contribution plans, however, fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the entire plan\xe2\x80\x99s solvency to reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.  Whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants or only to particular individuals, it creates the kind of harms that concerned \xc2\xa7409\xe2\x80\x99s draftsmen.  Thus, <em>Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d references, which accurately reflect \xc2\xa7409\xe2\x80\x99s operation in the defined benefit context, are beside the point in the defined contribution context.

Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Russell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/index.html">473 U. S. 134</a> (1985), we held that a participant in a disability plan that paid a fixed level of benefits could not bring suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(2), to recover consequential damages arising from delay in the processing of her claim.  In this case we consider whether that statutory provision authorizes a participant in a defined contribution pension plan to sue a fiduciary whose alleged misconduct impaired the value of plan assets in the participant\xe2\x80\x99s individual account.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Relying on our decision in <em>Russell</em>, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) \xe2\x80\x9cprovides remedies only for entire plans, not for individuals\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Recovery under this subsection must \xe2\x80\x98inure[\xc2\xa0] to the benefit of the plan <em>as a whole</em>,\xe2\x80\x99 not to particular persons with rights under the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>450 F.\xc2\xa03d 570, 572\xe2\x80\x93573 (2006) (quoting <em>Russell</em>,<em> </em>473 U. S., at 140).  While language in our <em>Russell</em> opinion is consistent with that conclusion, the rationale for <em>Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding supports the opposite result in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner filed this action in 2004 against his former employer, DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Associates (DeWolff), and the ERISA-regulated 401(k) retirement savings plan administered by DeWolff (Plan).  The Plan permits participants to direct the investment of their contributions in accordance with specified procedures and requirements.  Petitioner alleged that in 2001 and 2002 he directed DeWolff to make certain changes to the investments in his individual account, but DeWolff never carried out these directions.  Petitioner claimed that this omission \xe2\x80\x9cdepleted\xe2\x80\x9d his interest in the Plan by approximately $150,000, and amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.  The complaint sought \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98make-whole\xe2\x80\x99 or other equitable relief as allowed by [\xc2\xa7502(a)(3)],\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9csuch other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Civil Action No. 2:04\xe2\x80\x931747\xe2\x80\x9318 (D.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.), p.\xc2\xa04, 2 Record, Doc. 1.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint was essentially a claim for monetary relief that is not recoverable under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  Petitioner countered that he \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not wish for the court to award him any money, but \xe2\x80\xa6 simply want[ed] the plan to properly reflect that which would be his interest in the plan, but for the breach of fiduciary duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply to Defendants Motion to Dismiss, p.\xc2\xa07, 3 <em>id.,</em> Doc. 17.  The District Court concluded, however, that since respondents did not possess any disputed funds that rightly belonged to petitioner, he was seeking damages rather than equitable relief available under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that respondents had beached a fiduciary duty, the District Court nonetheless granted their motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal petitioner argued that he had a cognizable claim for relief under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3) of ERISA.  The Court of Appeals stated that petitioner had raised his \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) argument for the first time on appeal, but nevertheless rejected it on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 502(a)(2) provides for suits to enforce the liability-creating provisions of \xc2\xa7409, concerning breaches of fiduciary duties that harm plans.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court of Appeals cited language from our opinion in <em>Russell</em> suggesting that that these provisions \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the entire plan, rather than the rights of an individual beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  473 U. S., at 142.  It then characterized the remedy sought by petitioner as \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d because he \xe2\x80\x9cdesires recovery to be paid into his plan account, an instrument that exists specifically for his benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are therefore skeptical that plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s individual remedial interest can serve as a legitimate proxy for the plan in its entirety, as [\xc2\xa7502(a)(2)] requires.  To be sure, the recovery plaintiff seeks could be seen as accruing to the plan in the narrow sense that it would be paid into plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s plan <em>account</em>, which is part of the plan.  But such a view finds no license in the statutory text, and threatens to undermine the careful limitations Congress has placed on the scope of ERISA relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 574.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the make-whole relief he sought was \xe2\x80\x9cequitable\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa7502(a)(3).  Although our grant of certiorari, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), encompassed the \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) issue, we do not address it because we conclude that the Court of Appeals misread \xc2\xa7502(a)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the case comes to us we must assume that respondents breached fiduciary obligations defined in \xc2\xa7409(a), and that those breaches had an adverse impact on the value of the plan assets in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual account.  Whether petitioner can prove those allegations and whether respondents may have valid defenses to the claim are matters not before us.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Although the record does not reveal the relative size of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s account, the legal issue under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) is the same whether his account includes 1% or 99% of the total assets in the plan.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>Russell</em>, and in more detail in our later opinion in <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 508\xe2\x80\x93512 (1996), \xc2\xa7502(a) of ERISA identifies six types of civil actions that may be brought by various parties.  The second, which is at issue in this case, authorizes the Secretary of Labor as well as plan participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries, to bring actions on behalf of a plan to recover for violations of the obligations defined in \xc2\xa7409(a).  The principal statutory duties imposed on fiduciaries by that section \xe2\x80\x9crelate to the proper management, administration, and investment of fund assets,\xe2\x80\x9d with an eye toward ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits authorized by the plan\xe2\x80\x9d are ultimately paid to participants and beneficiaries.  <em>Russell</em>,<em> </em>473 U. S., at 142; see also <em>Varity</em>, 516 U. S., at 511\xe2\x80\x93512 (noting that \xc2\xa7409\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations \xe2\x80\x9crelat[e] to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s financial integrity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] a special congressional concern about plan asset management\xe2\x80\x9d).  The misconduct alleged by the petitioner in this case falls squarely within that category.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The misconduct alleged in <em>Russell</em>, by contrast,<em> </em>fell outside this category.  The plaintiff in <em>Russell</em> received all of the benefits to which she was contractually entitled, but sought consequential damages arising from a delay in the processing of her claim.  473 U. S., at 136\xe2\x80\x93137.  In holding that \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for this type of injury, we stressed that the text of \xc2\xa7409(a) characterizes the relevant fiduciary relationship as one \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d and repeatedly identifies the \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d as the victim of any fiduciary breach and the recipient of any relief.  See<em> id.</em>, at 140.  The legislative history likewise revealed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe crucible of congressional concern was misuse and mismanagement of plan assets by plan administrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 141, n.\xc2\xa08.  Finally, our review of ERISA as a whole confirmed that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(a)(2) and 409 protect \xe2\x80\x9cthe financial integrity of the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 142, n.\xc2\xa09, whereas other provisions specifically address claims for benefits.  See<em> id.</em>, at 143\xe2\x80\x93144 (discussing \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) and 503).  We therefore concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets, and with remedies that would protect the entire plan, rather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 142.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on protecting the \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d from fiduciary misconduct reflects the former landscape of employee benefit plans.  That landscape has changed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defined contribution plans dominate the retirement plan scene today.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In contrast, when ERISA was enacted, and when <em>Russell </em>was decided, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [defined benefit] plan was the norm of American pension practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Langbein, S. Stabile, &amp; B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 58 (4th ed. 2006); see also Zelinsky, The Defined Contribution Paradigm, 114 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 451, 471 (2004) (discussing the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant reversal of historic patterns under which the traditional defined benefit plan was the dominant paradigm for the provision of retirement income\xe2\x80\x9d).  Unlike the defined contribution plan in this case, the disability plan at issue in <em>Russell</em> did not have individual accounts; it paid a fixed benefit based on a percentage of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s salary.  See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em>, 722 F.\xc2\xa02d 482, 486 (CA9 1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d language in <em>Russell</em> speaks to the impact of \xc2\xa7409 on plans that pay defined benefits.  Misconduct by the administrators of a defined benefit plan will not affect an individual\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan.  It was that default risk that prompted Congress to require defined benefit plans (but not defined contribution plans) to satisfy complex minimum funding requirements, and to make premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for plan termination insurance.  See Zelinsky, 114 Yale L. J., at 475\xe2\x80\x93478.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For defined contribution plans, however, fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.  Whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants and beneficiaries, or only to persons tied to particular individual accounts, it creates the kind of harms that concerned the draftsmen of \xc2\xa7409.  Consequently, our references to the \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Russell, </em>which accurately reflect the operation of \xc2\xa7409 in the defined benefit context, are beside the point in the defined contribution context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other sections of ERISA confirm that the \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d language from <em>Russell</em>, which appears nowhere in \xc2\xa7409 or \xc2\xa7502(a)(2), does not apply to defined contribution plans.  Most significant is \xc2\xa7404(c), which exempts fiduciaries from liability for losses caused by participants\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of control over assets in their individual accounts.  See also 29 CFR \xc2\xa72550.404c\xe2\x80\x931 (2007).  This provision would serve no real purpose if, as respondents argue, fiduciaries never had any liability for losses in an individual account.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that although \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from\nplan injuries, that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets\nin a participant\xe2\x80\x99s individual account.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As its names imply, a \xe2\x80\x9cdefined contribution plan\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cindividual account plan\xe2\x80\x9d promises the participant the value of an individual account at retirement, which is largely a function of the amounts contributed to that account and the investment performance of those contributions.  A \xe2\x80\x9cdefined benefit plan,\xe2\x80\x9d by contrast, generally promises the participant a fixed level of retirement income, which is typically based on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s years of service and compensation.

S. ____ (2008)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 06-856<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">JAMES LaRUE, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> DeWOLFF, BOBERG\n&amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[February 20, 2008]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the decision below, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the loss to LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s individual plan account did not permit him to \xe2\x80\x9cserve as a legitimate proxy for the plan in its entirety,\xe2\x80\x9d thus barring him from relief under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(2).  450 F.\xc2\xa03d 570, 574 (2006).  The Court today rejects that reasoning.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4, 7\xe2\x80\x938.  I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was flawed, and join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion to that extent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, goes on to conclude that \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) does authorize recovery in cases such as the present one.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  It is not at all clear that this is true.  LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s right to direct the investment of his contributions was a right granted and governed by the plan.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2.  In this action, he seeks the benefits that would otherwise be due him if, as alleged, the plan carried out his investment instruction.  LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s claim, therefore, is a claim for benefits that turns on the application and interpretation of the plan terms, specifically those governing investment options and how to exercise them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is at least arguable that a claim of this nature properly lies only under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA.  That provision allows a plan participant or beneficiary \xe2\x80\x9cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(1)(B).  It is difficult to imagine a more accurate description of LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  And in fact claimants have filed suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) alleging similar benefit denials in violation of plan terms.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Hess</em> v. <em>Reg-Ellen Machine Tool Corp.</em>, 423 F.\xc2\xa03d 653, 657 (CA7 2005) (allegation made under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) that a plan administrator wrongfully denied instruction to move retirement funds from employer\xe2\x80\x99s stock to a diversified investment account).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If LaRue may bring his claim under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), it is not clear that he may do so under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) as well.  Section 502(a)(2) provides for \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d relief.  Construing the same term in a parallel ERISA provision, we have held that relief is not \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7502(a)(3) if another provision, such as \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), offers an adequate remedy.  See <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 515 (1996).  Applying the same rationale to an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) would accord with our usual preference for construing the \xe2\x80\x9csame terms [to] have the same meaning in different sections of the same statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Barnhill</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/393/index.html">503 U. S. 393</a>, 406 (1992), and with the view that ERISA in particular is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0comprehensive and reticulated statute\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully integrated civil enforcement provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/index.html">473 U. S. 134</a>, 146 (1985) (quoting <em>Nachman Corp.</em> v. <em>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/359/index.html">446 U. S. 359</a>, 361 (1980)).  In a variety of contexts, some Courts of Appeals have accordingly prevented plaintiffs from recasting what are in essence plan-derived benefit claims that should be brought under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) as claims for fiduciary breaches under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Coyne &amp; Delany Co.</em> v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc.</em>, 102 F.\xc2\xa03d 712, 714 (CA4 1996).  Other Courts of Appeals have disagreed with this approach.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Graden</em> v. <em>Conexant Systems Inc.</em>, 496 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 301 (CA3 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The significance of the distinction between a \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) claim and one under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) is not merely a matter of picking the right provision to cite in the complaint.  Allowing a \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) action to be recast as one under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) might permit plaintiffs to circumvent safeguards for plan administrators that have developed under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  Among these safeguards is the requirement, recognized by almost all the Courts of Appeals, see <em>Fallick</em> v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 410, 418, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA6 1998) (citing cases), that a participant exhaust the administrative remedies mandated by ERISA \xc2\xa7503, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71133, before filing suit under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).*<footcall num="*">  Equally significant, this Court has held that ERISA plans may grant administrators and fiduciaries discretion in determining benefit eligibility and the meaning of plan terms, decisions that courts may review only for an abuse of discretion.  <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em> v. <em>Bruch</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/101/index.html">489 U. S. 101</a>, 115 (1989).</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These safeguards encourage employers and others to undertake the voluntary step of providing medical and retirement benefits to plan participants, see <em>Aetna Health Inc.</em> v. <em>Davila</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/200/index.html">542 U. S. 200</a>, 215 (2004), and have no doubt engendered substantial reliance interests on the part of plans and fiduciaries.  Allowing what is really a claim for benefits under a plan to be brought as a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2), rather than as a claim for benefits due \xe2\x80\x9cunder the terms of [the] plan,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B), may result in circumventing such plan terms.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not mean to suggest that these are settled questions.  They are not.  Nor are we in a position to answer them.  LaRue did not rely on \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) as a source of relief, and the courts below had no occasion to address the argument, raised by an <em>amicus</em> in this Court, that the availability of relief under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) precludes LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary breach claim.  See Brief for ERISA Industry Committee as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13\xe2\x80\x9330.  I simply highlight the fact that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the present claim may be brought under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) is reached without considering whether the possible availability of relief under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) alters that conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United Parcel Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/index.html">451 U. S. 56</a>, 60, n. 2 (1981) (noting general reluctance to consider arguments raised only by an <em>amicus</em> and not considered by the courts below).  In matters of statutory interpretation, where principles of <em>stare decisis</em> have their greatest effect, it is important that we not seem to decide more than we do.  I see nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion precluding the lower courts on remand, if they determine that the argument is properly before them, from considering the contention that LaRue\xe2\x80\x99s claim may proceed only under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B).  In any event, other courts in other cases remain free to consider what we have not\xe2\x80\x94what effect the availability of relief under \xc2\xa7502(a)(1)(B) may have on a plan participant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to proceed under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2).</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Sensibly, the Court leaves open the question whether exhaustion may be required of a claimant who seeks recovery for a breach of fiduciary duty under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(2), but it is ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s text and not \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of harms that concerned [ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s] draftsmen\xe2\x80\x9d that compels my decision.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  In <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/134/index.html">473 U. S. 134</a> (1985), the Court held that \xc2\xa7409 of ERISA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71109, read together with \xc2\xa7502(a)(2), authorizes recovery only by \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan as an entity,\xe2\x80\x9d 473 U. S., at 140, and does not permit individuals to bring suit when they do not seek relief on behalf of the plan, <em>id.</em>, at 139\xe2\x80\x93144.  The majority accepts <em>Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental holding, but reins in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s further suggestion in <em>Russell</em> that suits under \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) are meant to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the entire plan,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of an individual beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x938; see <em>Russell</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 142.  The majority states that emphasizing the \xe2\x80\x9centire plan\xe2\x80\x9d was a sensible application of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7409 and 502(a)(2) in the historical context of defined benefit plans, but that the subsequent proliferation of defined contribution plans has rendered <em>Russell</em>\xe2\x80\x99s dictum inapplicable to most modern cases.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  In concluding that a loss suffered by a participant\xe2\x80\x99s defined contribution plan account because of a fiduciary breach \xe2\x80\x9ccreates the kind of harms that concerned the draftsmen of \xc2\xa7409,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority holds that \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) authorizes recovery for plan participants such as petitioner.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, I write separately because my reading of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7409 and 502(a)(2) is not contingent on trends in the pension plan market.  Nor does it depend on the ostensible \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns\xe2\x80\x9d of ERISA\xe2\x80\x99s drafters.  Rather, my conclusion that petitioner has stated a cognizable claim flows from the unambiguous text of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7409 and 502(a)(2) as applied to defined contribution plans.  Section 502(a)(2) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action may be brought\xe2\x80\x9d by a plan \xe2\x80\x9cparticipant, beneficiary or fiduciary,\xe2\x80\x9d or by the Secretary of Labor, to obtain \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate relief\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7409.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(a)(2).  Section 409(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a <em>plan</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be personally liable to make good to such <em>plan</em> any losses to the <em>plan</em> resulting from each [fiduciary] breach, and to restore to such<em> plan</em> any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the <em>plan</em> by the fiduciary\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71109(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain text of \xc2\xa7409(a), which uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d five times, leaves no doubt that \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) authorizes recovery only for the plan.  Likewise, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 repeated use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7409(a) clarifies that the key factor is whether the alleged losses can be said to be losses \xe2\x80\x9cto the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d not whether they are otherwise of a particular nature or kind.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, <em>ante,</em> at 4 (noting that the natural reading of \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  On their face, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7409(a) and 502(a)(2) permit recovery<em> </em>of <em>all </em>plan losses caused by a fiduciary breach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented here, then, is whether the losses to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual 401(k) account resulting from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alleged breach of their fiduciary duties were losses \xe2\x80\x9cto the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  In my view they were, because the assets allocated to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s individual account were plan assets.  ERISA requires the assets of a defined contribution plan (including \xe2\x80\x9cgains and losses\xe2\x80\x9d and legal recoveries) to be allocated for bookkeeping purposes to individual accounts within the plan for the beneficial interest of the participants, whose benefits in turn depend on the allocated amounts.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71002(34) (defining a \xe2\x80\x9cdefined contribution plan\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cplan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant\xe2\x80\x99s account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, when a defined contribution plan sustains losses, those losses are reflected in the balances in the plan accounts of the affected participants, and a recovery of those losses would be allocated to one or more individual accounts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The allocation of a plan\xe2\x80\x99s assets to individual accounts for bookkeeping purposes does not change the fact that all the assets in the plan remain plan assets.  A defined contribution plan is not merely a collection of unrelated accounts.  Rather, ERISA requires a plan\xe2\x80\x99s combined assets to be held in trust and legally owned by the plan trustees.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71103(a) (providing that \xe2\x80\x9call assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, the assets of a defined contribution plan under ERISA constitute, at the very least, the sum of all the assets allocated for bookkeeping purposes to the participants\xe2\x80\x99 individual accounts.  Because a defined contribution plan is essentially the sum of its parts, losses attributable to the account of an individual participant are necessarily \xe2\x80\x9closses to the plan\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7409(a).  Accordingly, when a participant sustains losses to his individual account as a result of a fiduciary breach, the plan\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate assets are likewise diminished by the same amount, and \xc2\xa7502(a)(2) permits that participant to recover such losses on behalf of the plan.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Of course, a participant suing to recover benefits on behalf of the plan is not entitled to monetary relief payable directly to him; rather, any recovery must be paid to the plan.</p>\n</footnote></casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
