JUSTICE STORY delivered the opinion of the Court, and after stating the case, proceeded as follows:  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 21 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The question in this case is whether the demurrer was well taken.  In support of the decree, two points are stated at the bar:  1st, that the plaintiff has not shown any interest in the subject, entitling the State of Virginia to maintain the bill; 2d, that if there was originally any resulting authority to the state to compel an account, that power, by the erection of Kentucky into an independent state, devolved on the latter state, the defendant having been and still continuing to be a citizen of that state, and that it was not competent for the Legislature of Virginia in 1813 to pass a law which should bind a citizen of Kentucky to account for official duties which were not performed in virtue of any appointment made by the government of Virginia.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to consider the last objection, because we are of opinion that the first is fatal to the bill.  The act of 1783 for the better locating and surveying the lands given to the officers and soldiers on Continental and state establishments authorizes the deputations of officers, therein named to appoint superintendents in behalf of their respective lines for the purpose of surveying the lands, and also to appoint two principal surveyors, and contract with them for their fees, &amp;c.  The third section of the act then provides</p>\n<p>"That every person or persons holding officers\' or soldiers\' warrants by assignment shall pay down to the principal surveyors at the time of the delivering such warrant or warrants one dollar for every hundred acres thereof, exclusive of the legal surveyor\'s fees, towards raising a fund for the purpose </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 21 U. S. 370</a></p><p> of supporting all contingent expenses, or, at the option of such holder or holders, the same may be held up until the warrants of all the original grantees have been surveyed, the said surveyors to account for all the money so received to such person or persons as the said deputations may direct."</p>\n<p>This is the clause upon which the bill is founded.  And it is apparent that in terms it provides for an accountability not to the state, but to persons to be appointed by the deputations of officers, to those for whose benefit the fund was raised, and was to be applied, and not to the state, which had no interest whatsoever in it.  Even then, if by the death of all the deputations of officers without making any appointment the authority intended by the act became incapable of being executed, there is no averment in the bill to that effect; on the contrary, the bill does admit that superintendents were appointed, of whom some are dead, and the survivors decline to act.  If, therefore, under any circumstances a resulting power could arise to the state to enforce an account from the want of any proper private parties <em>in esse</em> to claim it, such a case is not stated by the bill.  Whether in such a case the assignees of the warrants, or a part of them suing in behalf of the whole, might not maintain a suit in equity for an account is not for us now to determine.  It is sufficient that the State of Virginia, by the very terms of the act, has delegated to other persons, whose existence is not denied, the authority to call the surveyors to account.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
