Corcoran was sentenced to death.  After Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts failed, he sought federal habeas relief.  Corcoran argued in his federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court committed various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment; (3) Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s capital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the prosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5) he should not be executed because he suffers from a mental illness.  See <em>Corcoran</em> v. <em>Buss</em>, 483 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 709, 719, 726 (ND Ind. 2007).  The District Court granted habeas relief on Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s claim of a Sixth Amendment violation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Corcoran to a penalty other than death.  <em>Id.</em>, at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.  The District Court did not address Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments relating to his sentence, noting that they were \xe2\x80\x9crendered moot\xe2\x80\x9d by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because of the Sixth Amendment violation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 734.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment ruling.  <em>Corcoran</em> v. <em>Buss</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 703, 712, 714 (2008).  Then, without mentioning Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s other sentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded \xe2\x80\x9cwith instructions to deny the writ,\xe2\x80\x9d stating that \xe2\x80\x9cIndiana is at liberty to reinstate the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 714.  Corcoran sought rehearing, arguing that the Court of Appeals should have allowed the District Court to consider his additional attacks on his sentence.  But the Court of Appeals denied rehearing, again without referring to Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s undecided claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now grant certiorari and hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in disposing of Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s other claims without explanation of any sort.  The Seventh Circuit should have permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s unresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or should have itself explained why such consideration was unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Corcoran\xe2\x80\x99s claims were waived, and that they were in any event frivolous, so that a remand would be wasteful.  Brief in Opposition 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Nothing in the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, suggests that this was the basis for that court\xe2\x80\x99s order that the writ be denied.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
