JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The building trades union in this case supported its efforts to organize mechanical subcontractors by picketing certain general contractors, including petitioner.  The union\'s sole objective was to compel the general contractors to agree that, in letting subcontracts for mechanical work, they would deal only with firms that were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="619">Page 421 U. S. 619</a></p><p> parties to the union\'s current collective bargaining agreement.  The union disclaimed any interest in representing the general contractors\' employees.  In this case, the picketing succeeded, and petitioner seeks to annul the resulting agreement as an illegal restraint on competition under federal and state law.  The union claims immunity from federal antitrust statutes, and argues that federal labor regulation preempts state law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Local 100 is the bargaining representative for workers in the plumbing and mechanical trades in Dallas.  When this litigation began, it was party to a multiemployer bargaining agreement with the Mechanical Contractors Association of Dallas, a group of about 75 mechanical contractors.  That contract contained a "most favored nation" clause by which the union agreed that, if it granted a more favorable contract to any other employer, it would extend the same terms to all members of the Association.</p>\n<p>Connell Construction Co. is a general building contractor in Dallas.  It obtains jobs by competitive bidding and subcontracts all plumbing and mechanical work.  Connell has followed a policy of awarding these subcontracts on the basis of competitive bids, and it has done business with both union and nonunion subcontractors.  Connell\'s employees are represented by various building trade unions.  Local 100 has never sought to represent them or to bargain with Connell on their behalf.</p>\n<p>In November, 1970, Local 100 asked Connell to agree that it would subcontract mechanical work only to firms that had a current contract with the union.  It demanded that Connell sign the following agreement:</p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, the contractor and the union are engaged in the construction industry, and "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="620">Page 421 U. S. 620</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, the contractor and the union desire to make an agreement applying in the event of subcontracting in accordance with Section 8(e) of the Labor-Management Relations Act;"</p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, it is understood that, by this agreement, the contractor does not grant, nor does the union seek, recognition as the collective bargaining representative of any employees of the signatory contractor; and"</p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, it is further understood that the subcontracting limitation provided herein applies only to mechanical work which the contractor does not perform with his own employees, but uniformly subcontracts to other firms;"</p>\n<p>"THEREFORE, the contractor and the union mutually agree with respect to work falling within the scope of this agreement that is to be done at the site of construction, alteration, painting or repair of any building, structure, or other works, that [if] the contractor should contract or subcontract any of the aforesaid work falling within the normal trade jurisdiction of the union, said contractor shall contract or subcontract such work only to firms that are parties to an executed, current collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 100 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry."</p>\n<p>When Connell refused to sign this agreement, Local 100 stationed a single picket at one of Connell\'s major construction sites.  About 150 workers walked off the job, and construction halted.  Connell filed suit in state court to enjoin the picketing as a violation of Texas antitrust laws.  Local 100 removed the case to federal court.  Connell then signed the subcontracting agreement under protest.  It amended its complaint to claim that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="621">Page 421 U. S. 621</a></p><p> agreement violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2, and was therefore invalid.  Connell sought a declaration to this effect and an injunction against any further efforts to force it to sign such an agreement.</p>\n<p>By the time the case went to trial, Local 100 had submitted identical agreements to a number of other general contractors in Dallas.  Five others had signed, and the union was waging a selective picketing campaign against those who resisted.</p>\n<p>The District Court held that the subcontracting agreement was exempt from federal antitrust laws because it was authorized by the construction industry proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as added, 73 Stat. 543, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(e).  The court also held that federal labor legislation preempted the State\'s antitrust laws.  78 L.R.R.M. 3012 (ND Tex.1971).  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 483 F.2d 1154 (1973), with one judge dissenting.  It held that Local 100\'s goal of organizing nonunion subcontractors was a legitimate union interest, and that its efforts toward that goal were therefore exempt from federal antitrust laws.  On the second issue, it held that state law was preempted under <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U. S. 236</a></span> (1959).  We granted certiorari on Connell\'s petition.  416 U.S. 981 (1974).  We reverse on the question of federal antitrust immunity and affirm the ruling on state law preemption.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The basic sources of organized labor\'s exemption from federal antitrust laws are \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731 and 738, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 17 and 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 52, and the Norris-La Guardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 71, and 73, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 104, 105, and 113.  These statutes declare </p><p><a class="page-number" name="622">Page 421 U. S. 622</a></p><p> that labor unions are not combinations.or conspiracies in restraint of trade, and exempt specific union activities, including secondary picketing and boycotts, from the operation of the antitrust laws.  <em>See United States v. Hutcheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html">312 U. S. 219</a></span> (1941).  They do not exempt concerted action or agreements between unions and nonlabor parties.  <em>Mine Workers v. Pennington,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/657/case.html">381 U. S. 657</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/657/case.html#662">381 U. S. 662</a></span> (1965).  The Court has recognized, however, that a proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargaining under the NLRA and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some union-employer agreements be accorded a limited nonstatutory exemption from antitrust sanctions.  <em>Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/676/case.html">381 U. S. 676</a></span> (1965).</p>\n<p>The nonstatutory exemption has its source in the strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate competition over wages and working conditions.  Union success in organizing workers and standardizing wages ultimately will affect price competition among employers, but the goals of federal labor law never could be achieved if this effect on business competition were held a violation of the antitrust laws.  The Court therefore has acknowledged that labor policy requires tolerance for the lessening of business competition based on differences in wages and working conditions.  <em>See Mine Workers v. Pennington, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/657/case.html#666">381 U. S. 666</a></span>; <em>Jewel Tea, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/676/case.html#692">381 U. S. 692</a></span>-693 (opinion of WHITE, J.).  Labor policy clearly does not require, however, that a union have freedom to impose direct restraints on competition among those who employ its members.  Thus, while the statutory exemption allows unions to accomplish some restraints by acting unilaterally, <em>e.g., Federation of Musicians v. Carroll,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/99/case.html">391 U. S. 99</a></span> (1968), the nonstatutory exemption offers no similar protection when a union and a nonlabor </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 421 U. S. 623</a></p><p> party agree to restrain competition in a business market.  <em>See Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/797/case.html">325 U. S. 797</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/797/case.html#806">325 U. S. 806</a></span>-811 (1945); Cox, Labor and the Antitrust Laws -- A Preliminary Analysis, 104 U.Pa.L.Rev. 252 (1955); Meltzer, Labor Unions, Collective Bargaining, and the Antitrust Laws, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 659 (1965).</p>\n<p>In this case, Local 100 used direct restraints on the business market to support its organizing campaign.  The agreements with Connell and other general contractors indiscriminately excluded nonunion subcontractors from a portion of the market, even if their competitive advantages were not derived from substandard wages and working conditions, but rather from more efficient operating methods.  Curtailment of competition based on efficiency is neither a goal of federal labor policy nor a necessary effect of the elimination of competition among workers.  Moreover, competition based on efficiency is a positive value that the antitrust laws strive to protect.</p>\n<p>The multiemployer bargaining agreement between Local 100 and the Association, though not challenged in this suit, is relevant in determining the effect that the agreement between Local 100 and Connell would have on the business market.  The "most favored nation" clause in the multiemployer agreement promised to eliminate competition between members of the Association and any other subcontractors that Local 100 might organize.  By giving members of the Association a contractual right to insist on terms as favorable as those given any competitor, it guaranteed that the union would make no agreement that would give an unaffiliated contractor a competitive advantage over members of the Association. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Subcontractors in the Association thus </p><p><a class="page-number" name="624">Page 421 U. S. 624</a></p><p> stood to benefit from any extension of Local 100\'s organization, but the method Local 100 chose also had the effect of sheltering them from outside competition in that portion of the market covered by subcontracting agreements between general contractors and Local 100.  In that portion of the market, the restriction on subcontracting would eliminate competition on all subjects covered by the multiemployer agreement, even on subjects unrelated to wages, hours, and working conditions.</p>\n<p>Success in exacting agreements from general contractors would also give Local 100 power to control access to the market for mechanical subcontracting work.  The agreements with general contractors did not simply prohibit subcontracting to any nonunion firm; they prohibited subcontracting to any firm that did not have a contract with Local 100.  The union thus had complete control over subcontract work offered by general contractors that had signed these agreements.  Such control could result in significant adverse effects on the market and on consumers effects unrelated to the union\'s legitimate goals of organizing workers and standardizing working conditions.  For example, if the union thought the interests of its members would be served by having fewer subcontractors competing for the available work, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="625">Page 421 U. S. 625</a></p><p> it could refuse to sign collective bargaining agreements with marginal firms.  <em>Cf. Mine Workers v. Pennington, supra.</em>  Or, since Local 100 has a well defined geographical jurisdiction, it could exclude "traveling" subcontractors by refusing to deal with them.  Local 100 thus might be able to create a geographical enclave for local contractors, similar to the closed market in <em>Allen Bradley, supra.</em></p>\n<p>This record contains no evidence that the union\'s goal was anything other than organizing as many subcontractors as possible. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  This goal was legal, even though a successful organizing campaign ultimately would reduce the competition that unionized employers face from nonunion firms.  But the methods the union chose are not immune from antitrust sanctions simply because the goal is legal.  Here Local 100, by agreement with several contractors, made nonunion subcontractors ineligible to compete for a portion of the available work.  This kind of direct restraint on the business market has substantial anticompetitive effects, both actual and potential, that would not follow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working conditions.  It contravenes antitrust policies to a degree not justified by congressional labor policy, and therefore cannot claim a nonstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>There can be no argument in this case, whatever its force in other contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude </p><p><a class="page-number" name="626">Page 421 U. S. 626</a></p><p> might be entitled to an antitrust exemption if it were included in a lawful collective bargaining agreement.  <em>Cf. Mine Workers v.

In this case, Local 100 had no interest in representing Connell\'s employees.  The federal policy favoring collective bargaining therefore can offer no shelter for the union\'s coercive action against Connell or its campaign to exclude nonunion firms from the subcontracting market.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Local 100 nonetheless contends that the kind of agreement it obtained from Connell is explicitly allowed by the construction industry proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e), and that antitrust policy therefore must defer to the NLRA.  The majority in the Court of Appeals declined to decide this issue, holding that it was subject to the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the NLRB.  483 F.2d at 1174.  This Court has held, however, that the federal courts may decide labor law questions that emerge as collateral issues in suits brought under independent federal remedies, including the antitrust laws. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  We conclude that \xc2\xa7 8(e) does not allow this type of agreement.</p>\n<p>Local 100\'s argument is straightforward:  the first proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e) allows</p>\n<p>"an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="627">Page 421 U. S. 627</a></p><p> work. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>Local 100 is a labor organization, Connell is an employer in the construction industry, and the agreement covers only work "to be done at the site of construction, alteration, painting or repair of any building, structure, or other works."  Therefore, Local 100 says, the agreement comes within the proviso.  Connell responds by arguing that, despite the unqualified language of the proviso, Congress intended only to allow subcontracting agreements within the context of a collective bargaining relationship; that is, Congress did not intend to permit a union to approach a "stranger" contractor and obtain a binding agreement not to deal with nonunion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="628">Page 421 U. S. 628</a></p><p> subcontractors.  On its face, the proviso suggests no such limitation.  This Court has held, however, that \xc2\xa7 8(e) must be interpreted in light of the statutory setting and the circumstances surrounding its enactment:</p>\n<p>"It is a \'familiar rule, that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers.\'  <em>Holy Trinity Church v.

In \xc2\xa7 8(e), Congress broadly proscribed using contractual agreements to achieve the economic coercion prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4).  <em>See National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/612/case.html#634">386 U. S. 634</a></span>.  The provisos exempting the construction and garment industries were added by the Conference Committee in an apparent compromise between the House bill, which prohibited all "hot cargo" agreements, and the Senate bill, which prohibited them only in the trucking industry. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Although the garment industry proviso was supported by detailed explanations in both Houses, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] the construction industry proviso was explained only by bare references to "the pattern of collective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="629">Page 421 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  It seems, however, to have been adopted as a partial substitute for an attempt to overrule this Court\'s decision in <em>NLRB v. Denver Building  Construction Trades Council,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html">341 U. S. 675</a></span> (1951). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Discussion of "special problems" in the construction industry, applicable to both the \xc2\xa7 8(e) proviso and the attempt to overrule <em>Denver Building Trades,</em> focused on the problems of picketing a single nonunion subcontractor on a multiemployer building project, and the close relationship between contractors and subcontractors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="630">Page 421 U. S. 630</a></p><p> at the jobsite. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Congress limited the construction industry proviso to that single situation, allowing subcontracting agreements only in relation to work done on a jobsite.  In contrast to the latitude it provided in the garment industry proviso, Congress did not afford construction unions an exemption from \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4)(b) or otherwise indicate that they were free to use subcontracting agreements as a broad organizational weapon.  In keeping with these limitations, the Court has interpreted the construction industry proviso as</p>\n<p>"a measure designed to allow agreements pertaining to certain secondary activities on the construction site because of the close community of interests there, but to ban secondary objective agreements concerning non-jobsite work, in which respect the construction industry is no different from any other."</p>\n<p><em>National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn.,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/612/case.html#638">386 U. S. 638</a></span>-639 (footnote omitted).  Other courts have suggested that it serves an even narrower function:</p>\n<p>"[T]he purpose of the section 8(e) proviso was to alleviate the frictions that may arise when union men work continuously alongside nonunion men on the same construction site."</p>\n<p><em>Drivers Local 696 v. NLRB,</em> 124 U.S. App. D.C. 93, 99, 361 F.2d 547, 553 (1966).  <em>See also Denver Building Trades,</em> 341 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#692">341 U. S. 692</a></span>-693 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting); <em>Essex County &amp; Vicinity</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="631">Page 421 U. S. 631</a></p><p> <em>District Council of Carpenters v. NLRB,</em> 332 F.2d 636, 640 (CA3 1964).</p>\n<p>Local 100 does not suggest that its subcontracting agreement is related to any of these policies.  It does not claim to be protecting Connell\'s employees from having to work alongside nonunion men.  The agreement apparently was not designed to protect Local 100\'s members in that regard, since it was not limited to jobsites on which they were working.  Moreover, the subcontracting restriction applied only to the work Local 100\'s members would perform themselves and allowed free subcontracting of all other work, thus leaving open a possibility that they would be employed alongside nonunion subcontractors.  Nor was Local 100 trying to organize a nonunion subcontractor on the building project it picketed.  The union admits that it sought the agreement solely as a way of pressuring mechanical subcontractors in the Dallas area to recognize it as the representative of their employees.</p>\n<p>If we agreed with Local 100 that the construction industry proviso authorizes subcontracting agreements with "stranger" contractors, not limited to any particular jobsite, our ruling would give construction unions an almost unlimited organizational weapon. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The unions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="632">Page 421 U. S. 632</a></p><p> would be free to enlist any general contractor to bring economic pressure on nonunion subcontractors, as long as the agreement recited that it only covered work to be performed on some jobsite somewhere.  The proviso\'s jobsite restriction then would serve only to prohibit agreements relating to subcontractors that deliver their work complete to the jobsite.</p>\n<p>It is highly improbable that Congress intended such a result.  One of the major aims of the 1959 Act was to limit "top-down" organizing campaigns, in which unions used economic weapons to force recognition from an employer regardless of the wishes of his employees. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Congress accomplished this goal by enacting \xc2\xa7 8(b)(7), which restricts primary recognitional picketing, and by further tightening \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4)(b), which prohibits the use of most secondary tactics in organizational campaigns.  Construction unions are fully covered by these sections.  The only special consideration given them in organizational campaigns is \xc2\xa7 8(f), which allows "prehire" agreements in the construction industry, but only under careful safeguards preserving workers\' rights to decline union representation.  The legislative history accompanying \xc2\xa7 8(f) also suggests that Congress may not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="633">Page 421 U. S. 633</a></p><p> have intended that strikes or picketing could be used to extract prehire agreements from unwilling employers. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>These careful limit on the economic pressure unions may use in aid of their organizational campaigns would be undermined seriously if the proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e) were construed to allow unions to seek subcontracting agreements, at large, from any general contractor vulnerable to picketing.  Absent a clear indication that Congress intended to leave such a glaring loophole in its restrictions on "top-down" organizing, we are unwilling to read the construction industry proviso as broadly as Local 100 suggests. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Instead, we think its authorization extends only to agreements in the context of collective bargaining relationship, and, in light of congressional references to the <em>Denver Building Trades</em> problem, possibly to common situs relationships on particular jobsites as well. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Finally, Local 100 contends that, even if the subcontracting agreement is not sanctioned by the construction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="634">Page 421 U. S. 634</a></p><p> industry proviso and therefore is illegal under \xc2\xa7 8(e), it cannot be the basis for antitrust liability because the remedies in the NLRA are exclusive.  This argument is grounded in the legislative history of the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments.  Congress rejected attempts to regulate secondary activities by repealing the antitrust exemptions in the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts, and created special remedies under the labor law instead. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  It made secondary activities unfair labor practices under \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4), and drafted special provisions for preliminary injunctions at the suit of the NLRB and for recovery of actual damages in the district courts.  \xc2\xa7 10(1) of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 453, as added, 61 Stat. 149, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(<em>l</em>), and \xc2\xa7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 158, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187.  But whatever significance this legislative choice has for antitrust suits based on those secondary activities prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4), it has no relevance to the question whether Congress meant to preclude antitrust suits based on the "hot cargo" agreements that it outlawed in 1959.  There is no legislative history in the 1959 Congress suggesting that labor law remedies for \xc2\xa7 8(e) violations were intended to be exclusive, or that Congress thought allowing antitrust remedies in cases like the present one would be inconsistent with the remedial scheme of the NLRA. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="635">Page 421 U. S. 635</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We therefore hold that this agreement, which is outside the context of a collective bargaining relationship and not restricted to a particular jobsite, but which nonetheless obligates Connell to subcontract work only to firms that have a contract with Local 100, may be the basis of a federal antitrust suit because it has a potential for restraining competition in the business market in ways that would not follow naturally from elimination of competition over wages and working conditions.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although we hold that the union\'s agreement with Connell is subject to the federal antitrust laws, it does not follow that state antitrust law may apply as well.  The Court has held repeatedly that federal law preempts state remedies that interfere with federal labor policy or with specific provisions of the NLRA.  <em>E.g., Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/274/case.html">403 U. S. 274</a></span> (1971); <em>Teamsters v. Morton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/252/case.html">377 U. S. 252</a></span> (1964); <em>Teamsters v. Oliver,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/283/case.html">358 U. S. 283</a></span> (1959). [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The use of state antitrust law to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="636">Page 421 U. S. 636</a></p><p> regulate union activities in aid of organization must also be preempted because it creates a substantial risk of conflict with policies central to federal labor law.</p>\n<p>In this area, the accommodation between federal labor and antitrust policy is delicate.  Congress and this Court have carefully tailored the antitrust statutes to avoid conflict with the labor policy favoring lawful employee organization, not only by delineating exemptions from antitrust coverage, but also by adjusting the scope of the antitrust remedies themselves.  <em>See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/310/469/case.html">310 U. S. 469</a></span> (1940).  State antitrust laws generally have not been subjected to this process of accommodation.  If they take account of labor goals at all, they may represent a totally different balance between labor and antitrust policies. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Permitting state antitrust law to operate in this field could frustrate the basic federal policies favoring employee organization and allowing elimination of competition among wage earners, and interfere with the detailed system Congress has created for regulating organizational techniques. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="637">Page 421 U. S. 637</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Because employee organization is central to federal labor policy and regulation of organizational procedures is comprehensive, federal law does not admit the use of state antitrust law to regulate union activity that is closely related to organizational goals.  Of course, other agreements between unions and nonlabor parties may yet be subject to state antitrust laws.  <em>See Teamsters v. Oliver, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/283/case.html#295">358 U. S. 295</a></span>-297.  The governing factor is the risk of conflict with the NLRA or with federal labor policy.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals decided whether the agreement between Local 100 and Connell, if subject to the antitrust laws, would constitute an agreement that restrains trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act.  The issue was not briefed and argued fully in this Court.  Accordingly, we remand for consideration whether the agreement violated the Sherman Act. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="638">Page 421 U. S. 638</a></p><p></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The primary effect of the agreement seems to have been to inhibit the union from offering any other employer a more favorable contract.  When asked at trial whether another subcontractor could get an agreement on any different terms, Local 100\'s business agent answered:</p>\n<p>"No.  The agreement says that no one will be given a more favorable agreement.  I couldn\'t, if I desired, as an agent, sign an agreement other than the ones in existence between the local contractors and the Local 100."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Q. I see.  So that\'s -- in other words, once you sign that contract with the Mechanical Contractors\' Association, that sets the only type of agreement which your Union can enter into with any other mechanical contractors; is that correct, sir?"</p>\n<p>"A. That is true."</p>\n<p>Tr. 446.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>There was no evidence that Local 100\'s organizing campaign was connected with any agreement with members of the multiemployer bargaining unit, and the only evidence of agreement among those subcontractors was the "most favored nation" clause in the collective bargaining agreement.  In fact, Connell has not argued the case on a theory of conspiracy between the union and unionized subcontractors.  It has simply relied on the multiemployer agreement as a factor enhancing the restraint of trade implicit in the subcontracting agreement it signed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Meat Cutters v.

The text of the proviso and the treatment in congressional debates and reports suggest that Congress intended to authorize garment workers\' unions to continue using subcontracting agreements as an organizational weapon.  <em>See Danielson v. Joint Board,</em> 494 F.2d 1230 (CA2 1974) (Friendly, J.).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Connell also has argued that the subcontracting agreement was subject to antitrust sanctions because the construction industry proviso authorizes only voluntary agreements.  The foundation of this argument is a contention that \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4)(b) forbids picketing to secure an otherwise lawful "hot cargo" agreement in the construction industry.  Because we hold that the agreement in this case is outside the \xc2\xa7 8(e) proviso, it is unnecessary to consider this alternative contention.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep.

JUSTICE STEWART argues that \xc2\xa7 303 provides the exclusive remedy for violations of \xc2\xa7 8(e), thereby precluding recourse to antitrust remedies.  For that proposition, the dissenting opinion relies upon "considerable evidence in the legislative materials."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/616/case.html#650">421 U. S. 650</a></span>.  In our view, these materials are unpersuasive.  In the first place, Congress did not amend \xc2\xa7 303 expressly to provide a remedy for violations of \xc2\xa7 8(e).  <em>See</em> Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 704(d), (e), 73 Stat. 544-545.  The House, in 1959, did reject proposals by Representatives Hiestand, Alger, and Hoffman to repeal labor\'s antitrust immunity.  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/616/case.html#650">421 U. S. 650</a></span>-654.  Those proposals, however, were much broader than the issue in this case.  The Hiestand-Alger proposal would have repealed antitrust immunity for any action in concert by two or more labor organizations.  The Hoffman proposal apparently intended to repeal labor\'s antitrust immunity entirely.  That the Congress rejected these extravagant proposals hardly furnishes proof that it intended to extend labor\'s antitrust immunity to include agreements with nonlabor parties, or that it thought antitrust liability under the existing statutes would be inconsistent with the NLRA.  The bill introduced by Senator McClellan two years later provides even less support for that proposition.  Like most bills introduced in Congress, it never reached a vote.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In most cases, a decision that state law is preempted leaves the parties with recourse only to the federal labor law, as enforced by the NLRB.  <em>See Motor Coach Employees v.

Connell obtained a temporary restraining order against the picketing on January 21, 1971, and thereafter executed the contract -- under protest -- with Local 100 on March 28, 1971.  So far as the record in this case reveals, there has been no further picketing at Connell\'s construction sites.  Accordingly, there is no occasion for us to consider whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids such an injunction where the specific agreement sought by the union is illegal, or to determine whether, within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, there was a "labor dispute" between these parties.  If the Norris-LaGuardia Act were applicable to this picketing, injunctive relief would not be available under the antitrust laws.  <em>See United States v. Hutcheson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/219/case.html">312 U. S. 219</a></span> (1941).  If the agreement in question is held on remand to be invalid under federal antitrust laws, we cannot anticipate that Local 100 will resume picketing to obtain or enforce an illegal agreement.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>While I join the opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART, I write to emphasize what is, for me, the determinative feature of the case.  Throughout this litigation, Connell has maintained only that Local 100 coerced it into signing the subcontracting agreement.  With the complaint so drawn, I have no difficulty in concluding that the union\'s conduct is regulated solely by the labor laws.  The question of antitrust immunity would be far different, however, if it were alleged that Local 100 had conspired with mechanical subcontractors to force nonunion subcontractors from the market by entering into exclusionary agreements with general contractors like Connell.  An arrangement of that character was condemned in <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/797/case.html">325 U.

S. 810</a></span>.  Were such a conspiracy alleged, the multiemployer bargaining agreement between Local 100 and the mechanical subcontractors would unquestionably be relevant.  <em>See Mine Workers v.

But since Connell has never alleged or attempted to show any conspiracy between Local 100 and the subcontractors, I agree that Connell\'s remedies, if any, are provided exclusively by the labor laws.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As part of its effort to organize mechanical contractors in the Dallas area, the respondent Local Union No. 100 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="639">Page 421 U. S. 639</a></p><p> engaged in peaceful picketing to induce the petitioner Connell Construction Co., a general contractor in the building and construction industry, to agree to subcontract plumbing and mechanical work at the construction site only to firms that had signed a collective bargaining agreement with Local 100.  None of Connell\'s own employees were members of Local 100, and the subcontracting agreement contained the union\'s express disavowal of any intent to organize or represent them.  The picketing at Connell\'s construction site was therefore secondary activity, subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation pursuant to \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as added, 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b)(4), and \xc2\xa7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 158, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187.  Similarly, the subcontracting agreement under which Connell agreed to cease doing business with nonunion mechanical contractors is governed by the provisions of \xc2\xa7 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(e).  The relevant legislative history unmistakably demonstrates that, in regulating secondary activity and "hot cargo" agreements in 1947 and 1959, Congress selected with great care the sanctions to be imposed if proscribed union activity should occur.  In so doing, Congress rejected efforts to give private parties injured by union activity such as that engaged in by Local 100 the right to seek relief under federal antitrust laws.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment before us.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>For a period of 15 years, from passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, in 1932 [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] until enactment of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="640">Page 421 U.

No. 510, <em>supra</em> at 67, 1 Leg.Hist. of LMRA 571, the House-Senate Conferees and then both Houses of Congress agreed to regulate Union secondary activity by making specified activity an unfair labor practice under \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, authorizing the Board to seek injunctions against such activity, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(<em>l</em>), and providing for recovery of actual damages in a suit by a private party under Senator Taft\'s compromise proposal, which became \xc2\xa7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187.

S. 634</a></span>, the deliberate congressional decision to make \xc2\xa7 303 the exclusive private remedy for unlawful secondary activity is clearly relevant to the question of Local 100\'s antitrust liability in the case before us.  The Court is correct, of course, in noting that \xc2\xa7 8(e)\'s prohibition of "hot cargo" agreements was not added to the Act until 1959, and that \xc2\xa7 303 was not then amended to cover \xc2\xa7 8(e) violations standing alone.  But as part of the 1959 amendments designed to close "technical loopholes" perceived in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress amended \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) to make it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to threaten or coerce a neutral employer, either directly or through his employees, where an object of the secondary pressure is to force the employer to enter into an agreement prohibited by \xc2\xa7 8(e). [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  At the same </p><p><a class="page-number" name="647">Page 421 U. S. 647</a></p><p> time, Congress expanded the scope of the \xc2\xa7 303 damages remedy to allow recovery of the actual damages sustained as a result of a union\'s engaging in secondary activity to force an employer to sign an agreement in violation of \xc2\xa7 8(e). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  In short, Congress has provided an employer like Connell with a fully effective private damages remedy for the allegedly unlawful union conduct involved in this case.</p>\n<p>The essence of Connell\'s complaint is that it was coerced by Local 100\'s picketing into "conspiring" with the union by signing an agreement that limited its ability </p><p><a class="page-number" name="648">Page 421 U. S. 648</a></p><p> to subcontract mechanical work on a competitive basis. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  If, as the Court today holds, the subcontracting agreement is not within the construction industry proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e), then Local 100\'s picketing to induce Connell to sign the agreement constituted a \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) unfair labor practice, and was therefore also unlawful under \xc2\xa7 303(a), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187(a). [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Accordingly, Connell has the right to sue Local 100 for damages sustained as a result </p><p><a class="page-number" name="649">Page 421 U. S. 649</a></p><p> of Local 100\'s unlawful secondary activity pursuant to \xc2\xa7 303(b), 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187(b).  Although "limited to actual, compensatory damages," <em>Teamsters v.

S. 260</a></span>, Connell would be entitled under \xc2\xa7 303 to recover all damages to its business that resulted from the union\'s coercive conduct, including any provable damage caused by Connell\'s inability to subcontract mechanical work to nonunion firms.  Similarly, any nonunion mechanical contractor who believes his business has been harmed by Local 100\'s having coerced Connell into signing the subcontracting agreement is entitled to sue the union for compensatory damages; for \xc2\xa7 303 broadly grants its damages action to "[w]hoever shall be injured in his business or property" by reason of a labor organization\'s engaging in a \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) unfair labor practice.

My proposal is in the nature of antitrust legislation, applied to labor unions."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 12135, 2 NLRB Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, p. 1507 (hereinafter Leg.Hist. of LMRDA).  Representative Alger of Texas joined in cosponsoring the legislation, stating that "[u]nion monopoly power" manifests itself in</p>\n<p>"restrictive trade practices such as price-fixing, restrictions on use of new processes and technological improvements, exclusion of products for the market, and so forth. . . .   This bill deals directly with [this aspect] of union monopoly power."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 12136, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1507.  Representative Alger added the following explanation of the bill:</p>\n<p>"Under the language of H.R. 8003, any attempt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="651">Page 421 U. S. 651</a></p><p> by a union to induce an employer or a group of employers to comply with a union demand which would result in restrictive trade practices would be unlawful and an employer faced with such a demand could seek legal remedies to restrain the union from enforcing its demand.  The consequent denial to unions of the right to fix prices or impose other artificial market limitations would not in any way interfere with normal and legitimate union functions or with their proper collective bargaining powers.  They would merely be placed on an equal footing with all other groups in society as was the case during the fifty years prior to the <em>Hutcheson</em> decision."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 12137, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1508.</p>\n<p>The Landrum-Griffin bill, H.R. 8400, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., which, as amended, was enacted as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] by contrast, clearly provided that the new secondary boycott </p><p><a class="page-number" name="652">Page 421 U.

Recognizing this important difference, Representative Alger proposed to amend the Landrum-Griffin bill by adding, as an additional title, the antitrust provisions of H.R. 8003.  105 Cong.Rec. 15532-15533, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1569.  Representative Alger once again stated that his proposed amendment would make it unlawful for an individual local union to</p>\n<p>"[e]nter into any arrangement -- voluntary or coerced -- with any employer, groups of employers, or other unions which cause product boycotts, price-fixing, or other types of restrictive trade practices."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 15533, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1569.</p>\n<p>Representative Griffin responded to Representative Alger\'s proposed amendment by observing:</p>\n<p>"[It] serves to point out that the substitute [the Landrum-Griffin bill] is a minimum bill.  It might be well at this point to mention some provisions that are not in it."</p>\n<p>"There is no antitrust law provision in this bill."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"This is truly a minimum bill that a responsible Congress should pass.  I believe I speak for the gentleman from Georgia [MR.

The gentleman from Georgia and I have tried to balance delicately the provisions which we believe should be in a bill at this time and which a majority of this body could support."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 15535, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1571-1572.  The Alger amendment was rejected, as were additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="653">Page 421 U.

The House then adopted the Landrum-Griffin bill over protests that it</p>\n<p>"does not go far enough, that it needs more teeth, and that more teeth are going to come in the form of legislation to bring labor union activities under the antitrust laws."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 15858, 2 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 1690 (remarks of Rep.

But no change was made in the nature of the sanctions authorized for violations of either section by the House-passed Landrum-Griffin bill:  An injured party could either seek relief from the Board or bring suit for damages under \xc2\xa7 303 against unions that violate the revised secondary boycott prohibitions.  No provisions were made for exposing proscribed union secondary activity or "hot cargo" agreements to antitrust liability.  <em>See</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 Leg.Hist. of LMRDA 934. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="654">Page 421 U.

[<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  As it had in 1947 and 1959, however, Congress in 1961 rejected this effort to subject illegal union secondary conduct to the sanctions of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>In sum, the legislative history of the 1947 and 1959 amendments and additions to national labor law clearly demonstrates that Congress did not intend to restore antitrust sanctions for secondary boycott activity such as that engaged in by Local 100 in this case, but rather </p><p><a class="page-number" name="655">Page 421 U. S. 655</a></p><p> intended to subject such activity only to regulation under the National Labor Relations Act and \xc2\xa7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act.

S. 620</a></span>.  At that point, it was apparent that the primary reason for the lawsuit was Connell\'s request for an injunction to stop the union\'s picketing.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>If, contrary to the Court\'s conclusion, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/616/case.html#626">421 U. S. 626</a></span>-633, Congress intended what it said in the proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e), then the subcontracting agreement is valid and, under the view of the Board and those Courts of Appeals that have considered the question, Local 100\'s picketing to obtain the agreement would also be lawful.  <em>See, e.g., Orange Belt District Council of Painters v. NLRB,</em> 117 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 236, 328 F.2d 534, 537; <em>Construction Laborers v. NLRB,</em> 323 F.2d 422 (CA9); <em>Northeastern Indiana Bldg. Trades Council,</em> 148 N.L.R.B. 854, <em>enforcement denied on other grounds,</em> 122 U.S.App.D.C. 220, 352 F.2d 696.  Connell would therefore have neither a remedy under \xc2\xa7 303 nor one with the Board.</p>\n<p>It would seem necessarily to follow that conduct specifically authorized by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act could not, by itself, be the basis for federal antitrust liability unless the Court intends to return to the era when the judiciary frustrated congressional design by determining for itself "what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands."  <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/443/case.html">254 U.

In my view, however, even if Local 100\'s conduct was unlawful, Connell may not seek to invoke the sanctions of the antitrust laws.  Accordingly, I find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether the subcontracting agreement entered into by Connell and Local 100 is within the ambit of the construction industry proviso to \xc2\xa7 8(e), and, if it is, whether it was permissible for Local 100 to utilize peaceful picketing to induce Connell to sign the agreement.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>If Connell and Local 100 had entered into a purely voluntary "hot cargo" agreement in violation of \xc2\xa7 8(e), an injured nonunion mechanical subcontractor would have no \xc2\xa7 303 remedy, because the union would not have engaged in any \xc2\xa7 8(b)(4) unfair labor practice.  The subcontractor, however, would still be able to seek the full range of Board remedies available for a \xc2\xa7 8(e) unfair labor practice.  Moreover, if Connell had truly agreed to limit its subcontracting without any coercion whatsoever on the part of Local 100, the affected subcontractor might well have a valid antitrust claim on the ground that Local 100 and Connell were engaged in the type of conspiracy aimed at third parties with which this Court dealt in <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/325/797/case.html">325 U. S. 797</a></span>.  At the very least, an antitrust suit by an injured subcontractor under circumstances in which Congress had failed to provide any form of private remedy for damage resulting from an illegal "hot cargo" agreement would present a very different question from the one before us -- a question which it is not now necessary to answer.  <em>Cf. Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/676/case.html">381 U.

S. 708</a></span> n. 9 (opinion of Goldberg, J.).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the signatory of a purely voluntary agreement that violates \xc2\xa7 8(e) is fully protected from any damage that might result from the illegal "hot cargo" agreement by his ability simply to ignore the contract provision that violates \xc2\xa7 8(e).  If the union should attempt to enforce the illicit "hot cargo" clause through any form of coercion, the employer may then bring a \xc2\xa7 303 damages suit or may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Board.  <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 158(b)(4)(B).  Since \xc2\xa7 8(e) provides that any prohibited agreement is "unenforceable and void," any union effort to invoke legal processes to compel the neutral employer to comply with his purely voluntary agreement would obviously be unavailing.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>The legislative proceedings leading to the passage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (the Landrum-Griffin Act), 73 Stat. 519, began in January, 1959, when Senator John Kennedy introduced S. 505, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.
