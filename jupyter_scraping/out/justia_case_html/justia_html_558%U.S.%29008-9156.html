S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), a federal court may grant a state prisoner habeas relief if his claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court and \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision \xe2\x80\xa6 based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa72254(e)(1), \xe2\x80\x9ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court [is] presumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d and the petitioner has \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Wood was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama state court.  Two of his court-appointed attorneys, Dozier and Ralph, had significant trial experience, but the third, Trotter, had only recently been admitted to the bar.  After exhausting his appeals, Wood sought postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, arguing, among other things, that he was mentally retarded and not eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to investigate and present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the trial\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase.  The Rule 32 court conducted evidentiary hearings and denied the claims initially and on remand.  As to the mental retardation claim, it found that Wood had not shown deficits in his adaptive functioning.  As to the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it concluded that he had not established that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense.  In so doing, it made a factual finding that counsel had made a strategic decision not to pursue evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s alleged retardation.  Observing that counsel had asked Dr. Kirkland to conduct a mental evaluation, had thoroughly reviewed his report, and had determined that no further investigation was warranted, the court additionally held that counsel appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present their limited mental-deficiency evidence to the jury because having Dr. Kirkland testify was not in Wood\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.  It also found no reasonable probability of a different outcome had the evidence developed in the Rule 32 proceedings been presented at trial.  Woods subsequently sought federal habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254.  The District Court rejected all but his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  The District Court concluded that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that counsel made a strategic decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts.  The court further held that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient and had prejudiced Wood, and that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary holdings were an unreasonable application of federal law under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>.  Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance claim was neither an unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  With respect to the facts, it concluded that the evidence in the Rule 32 hearings supported the state court\xe2\x80\x99s strategic-decision finding, and it agreed with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic decision was reasonable and that Wood had failed to show prejudice.  Wood\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition raises the questions (1) whether, in order to obtain relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish only that the state-court factual determination on which the decision was based was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d or whether \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) additionally requires a petitioner to rebut a presumption that the determination was correct with clear and convincing evidence; and (2) whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s strategic-decision determination was reasonable.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Even under Wood\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), the state court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that his counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings.  This Court need not reach the question whether \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), see Rice</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/333/index.html">546 U. S. 333</a>, 339, because its view of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination here does not depend on an interpretative difference regarding the relationship between those provisions.  While \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\xa6 difficult to define,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 410, it suffices to say that a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.  See <em>Rice, supra,</em> at 341\xe2\x80\x93342.  Here, the state-court record shows that all of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel read the Kirkland report.  Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the report merited further investigation, a recollection supported by the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 contemporaneous letters; and Trotter told the sentencing judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the report to the jury.  This evidence can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pursue or present evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but the result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses.  Most of the contrary evidence Wood highlights\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g., </em>that Dozier and Ralph put the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase proceedings\xe2\x80\x94speaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but to whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was reasonable, a question not before this Court.  Any evidence plausibly inconsistent with the strategic-decision finding does not suffice to show that the finding was unreasonable.

Under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), a federal court may not grant a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s application for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim already adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa72254(e)(1), \xe2\x80\x9ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d and the petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cshall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this case, petitioner, a capital defendant, challenges the key factual finding made by the Alabama state court that denied his application for postconviction relief: that his attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 failure to pursue and present mitigating evidence of his borderline mental retardation was a strategic decision rather than a negligent omission.  Petitioner argues that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding was unreasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and that, in denying his federal habeas petition, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit erroneously conflated this standard with that of \xc2\xa72254(e)(1), which petitioner contends is not applicable in cases, such as this one, not involving a separate federal habeas evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to address the relationship between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and (e)(1).  We conclude, however, that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination was reasonable even under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), and therefore we need not address that provision\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on that basis.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1993, petitioner Holly Wood broke into the home of his ex-girlfriend and shot her in the head and face as she lay in her bed.  The victim was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.  Charged with capital murder during a first-degree burglary, Wood was represented at trial in Alabama state court by three court-appointed attorneys: Cary Dozier and Frank Ralph, both of whom had significant trial experience, and Kenneth Trotter, who had been admitted to the bar for five months at the time he was appointed.  The jury convicted Wood at the guilt phase of trial and recommended a death sentence at the penalty phase by a vote of 10 to 2.  After a separate sentencing hearing, the trial judge imposed the death penalty.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Wood\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence, <em>Ex parte Wood</em>, 715 So.\xc2\xa02d 812 (1996), as did the Alabama Supreme Court, <em>Wood</em> v. <em>State</em>, 715 So.\xc2\xa02d 819 (1998).  This Court denied certiorari.  <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/525/1042/index.html">525 U. S. 1042</a> (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wood petitioned for state postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2009), arguing, among other things, that he was mentally retarded and not eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial counsel were ineffective under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), because they failed to investigate and present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the penalty phase of trial.

The Rule 32 court held two evidentiary hearings and denied Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  On appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a> (2002), which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of the mentally retarded.  <em>Wood</em> v. <em>State</em>, 891 So.\xc2\xa02d 398 (2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the Rule 32 court conducted a third evidentiary hearing and once again denied relief.  As to Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claim of mental retardation, the court found that, while the evidence suggested that he \xe2\x80\x9cprobably does exhibit significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,\xe2\x80\x9d he had failed to show \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has significant or substantial deficits in his adaptive functioning.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 236a\xe2\x80\x93237a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court also rejected Wood\xe2\x80\x99s factually related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, concluding that Wood had failed to establish that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense.  <em>Id.,</em> at 257a\xe2\x80\x93275a.  The court first made a factual finding that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had made a strategic decision not to pursue evidence of his alleged mental retardation.  The court observed that counsel had requested that a Dr. Karl Kirkland conduct a mental evaluation, had \xe2\x80\x9cthoroughly reviewed Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s report,\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that nothing in that report merited further investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 264a, 271a.  The court additionally found that counsel appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present to the jury the limited evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies in their possession, because \xe2\x80\x9ccalling Dr. Kirkland to testify was not in Wood\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 271a\xe2\x80\x93272a.  The court concluded that these strategic decisions were reasonable and thus that counsel had not performed deficiently.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The court further concluded that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno reasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d of a different outcome had the evidence developed in the Rule 32 hearings been presented to the jury or to the sentencing court.  <em>Id.,</em> at 273a.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, App. 589\xe2\x80\x93610, and the Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>id.,</em> at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wood then filed a petition for federal habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254.  The District Court rejected all of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claims save one: that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate and present mitigation evidence of his mental deficiencies during the penalty phase constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.  465 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1211, 1239\xe2\x80\x931245 (MD Ala. 2006).  According to the court, there was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the record to even remotely support a finding that counsel made a strategic decision not to let the jury at the penalty stage know about Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1242.  Ralph and Dozier, the court noted, had placed the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase.  At the Rule 32 hearing, Trotter testified that he had seen the references to Wood\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual functioning in the Kirkland report but did not recall considering whether to pursue that issue.  Trotter further testified that he had unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena Wood\xe2\x80\x99s school records and that he did not recall speaking to any of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s teachers.  Trotter had also written to an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center explaining that he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stressed out over this case and [didn\xe2\x80\x99t] have anyone with whom to discuss the case, including the other two attorneys.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1241.  Shortly before the penalty phase began, Trotter told the judge that he would request further psychological evaluation before the judge\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing hearing, even though the evaluation would come too late to be considered by the jury.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1241\xe2\x80\x931242.  Based on this evidence, the District Court concluded that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding \xe2\x80\x9cthat a strategic decision was made not to investigate or introduce to the sentencing jury evidence of mental retardation [was] an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the clear and convincing evidence presented in the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having rejected the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determinations, the District Court held that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient and that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance prejudiced Wood, concluding that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings to the contrary constituted \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of federal law under <em>Strickland</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1245.  The court granted the petition on this claim and ordered the State either to resentence Wood to life without parole or to conduct a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a divided opinion, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the grant of habeas relief.  542 F.\xc2\xa03d 1281 (2008).  The majority began by explaining the standard of review: \xe2\x80\x9cSection 2254(d) permits federal habeas relief only where the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions were (1) \xe2\x80\x98contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 or (2) \xe2\x80\x98based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1285 (quoting \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2)).  A \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the majority explained, and the petitioner \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting \xc2\xa72254(e)(1)). \xe2\x80\x9cThus,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority stated, the federal habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98review of findings of fact by the state court is even more deferential than under a clearly erroneous standard of review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority then held that the Alabama court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was neither an unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  With respect to the facts, the court concluded that the evidence presented in the Rule 32 hearings supported the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings that counsel made a strategic decision not to present mental health evidence during the penalty phase.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt a minimum,\xe2\x80\x9d the court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cWood has not presented evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, that counsel did not make such decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1304, n.\xc2\xa023.  The court also agreed with the state court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s strategic decision was reasonable.  According to the court, the silent record created a presumption that counsel exercised sound professional judgment, supported by ample reasons, not to present the information they had obtained.  These reasons included unfavorable information in Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s report, such as details about Wood\xe2\x80\x99s 19 earlier arrests and his previous attempt to murder another ex-girlfriend, as well as Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, notwithstanding Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies, Wood had a high level of adaptive functioning.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1304\xe2\x80\x931306.  The court added that the investigation preceding counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was sufficient to permit them to make a reasoned decision, crediting the Rule 32 court\xe2\x80\x99s findings that, <em>inter alia</em>, counsel not only employed an investigator who sought mitigation evidence from family members but also themselves met with family members and sought guidance from capital defense organizations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1307\xe2\x80\x931308.  The court also accepted as not \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d the state court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Wood had failed to show prejudice from counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to present evidence of his mental deficiencies.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1309, 1314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent, implicitly considering the factual question whether counsel made a strategic decision as part and parcel of the legal question whether any strategic decision was reasonable, concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o such strategic decisions could possibly have been made in this case because counsel had failed to adequately investigate the available mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1316.  According to the dissent, \xe2\x80\x9cthe weight of the evidence in the record demonstrates that Trotter, an inexperienced and overwhelmed attorney,\xe2\x80\x9d unassisted by senior counsel, \xe2\x80\x9crealized too late\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94only in time to present it to the sentencing judge, not to the penalty jury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat any reasonably prepared attorney would have known: that evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental impairments could have served as mitigating evidence and deserved investigation so that it could properly be presented before sentencing<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Id</em>., at 1320.  The dissent also concluded that there was a reasonable probability of a different outcome at the penalty phase had the evidence been presented, because the jury could have concluded that Wood was less culpable as a result of his diminished abilities.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1322\xe2\x80\x931325.  The dissent therefore concluded that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Strickland</em> to the facts of this case was unreasonable.  542 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 1326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve two related questions raised by Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  First, we granted review of a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals: whether, in order to satisfy \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish only that the state-court factual determination on which the decision was based was \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d or whether \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) additionally requires a petitioner to rebut a presumption that the determination was correct with clear and convincing evidence.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We also granted review of the question whether the state court reasonably determined that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel made a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic decision\xe2\x80\x9d not to pursue or present evidence of his mental deficiencies.  556 U. S. __ (2009).  Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition raised two additional questions on which we declined to grant certiorari.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Neither of these asked us to review whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) and <em>Strickland</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding statements we have made about the relationship between \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and (e)(1) in cases that did not squarely present the issue, see Brief for Petitioner 37\xe2\x80\x9338; Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9329, we have explicitly left open the question whether \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), see <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/333/index.html">546 U. S. 333</a>, 339 (2006).  The parties and their <em>amici</em> have offered a variety of ways to read the relationship between these two provisions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Although we granted certiorari to resolve the question of how \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and (e)(1) fit together, we find once more that we need not reach this question, because our view of the reasonableness of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination in this case does not turn on any interpretive difference regarding the relationship between these provisions.  For present purposes, we assume for the sake of argument that the factual determination at issue should be reviewed, as Wood urges, only under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and not under \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).  We conclude that, under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or present evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings.  We therefore do not need to decide whether that determination should be reviewed under the arguably more deferential standard set out in \xc2\xa72254(e)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have observed in related contexts, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99 is no doubt difficult to define.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 410 (2000).  It suffices to say, however, that a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 411.  In <em>Rice</em>, for example, in which we assumed, <em>arguendo</em>, that only \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) and not \xc2\xa72254(e)(1) applied, 546 U. S., at 339, we rejected the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that a state-court factual determination was unreasonable.  We noted that even if \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree\xe2\x80\x9d about the finding in question, \xe2\x80\x9con habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 determination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 341\xe2\x80\x93342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the evidence in the state-court record demonstrated that all of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel read the Kirkland report.  App. 12, 174, 210, 283.  Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the report merited further investigation, a recollection that is supported by contemporaneous letters Trotter wrote to Dozier and Ralph noting that no independent psychological evaluations had been conducted because Dozier had said they would not be needed.  <em>Id.,</em> at 283, 343, 345.  Trotter also told the sentencing judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the Kirkland report to the jury.  <em>Id.,</em> at 12.  This evidence in the state-court record can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pursue or present evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but was instead the result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arguing that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determination to this effect was unreasonable, Wood calls our attention to Dozier\xe2\x80\x99s testimony during the Rule 32 proceedings that evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental health problems would have been presented during the penalty phase if counsel had been aware of it, <em>id.,</em> at 169; that Dozier did not recall whether he had decided not to present evidence based on the Kirkland report, <em>id.,</em> at 168, 171; and that Dozier and Ralph had designated the inexperienced Trotter to be in charge of the penalty phase proceedings, <em>id.,</em> at 270\xe2\x80\x93271.  Trotter, in turn, testified that he did not recall considering Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies.  <em>Id.,</em> at 288.  Wood also observes that the Kirkland report was prepared for the guilt phase, not the penalty phase, and a strategic decision not to use the Kirkland report in the former does not necessarily carry over into the latter.  <em>Id.,</em> at 324.  Wood notes that his counsel sought to obtain additional evidence about his mental health to use in mitigation after reviewing the Kirkland report, but they failed to pursue it, in part out of a belief that the sentencing judge would not grant a continuance to permit them to investigate.  <em>Id.,</em> at 285, 343\xe2\x80\x93346.  Finally, Wood emphasizes that his counsel must have thought that evidence of his mental deficiencies was important because they presented it to the judge at the final sentencing hearing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 88.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the evidence Wood highlights, however, speaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but rather to whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was reasonable\xe2\x80\x94a question we do not reach.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.  As for any evidence that may plausibly be read as inconsistent with the finding that counsel made a strategic decision, we conclude that it does not suffice to demonstrate that the finding was unreasonable.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reviewing all of the evidence, we agree with the State that even if it is debatable, it is not unreasonable to conclude that, after reviewing the Kirkland report, counsel made a strategic decision not to inquire further into the information contained in the report about Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies and not to present to the jury such information as counsel already possessed about these deficiencies.  Cf. <em>Rice</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 341\xe2\x80\x93342.  For that reason, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the District Court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wood also argues that the state-court decision involved an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland</em> under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) because counsel failed to make a reasonable investigation of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies before deciding not to pursue or present such evidence.  Without a reasonable investigation, Wood contends, these decisions were an unreasonable exercise of professional judgment and constituted deficient performance under <em>Strickland</em>.  We agree with the State, however, that this argument is not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly included\xe2\x80\x9d in the questions presented under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 14.1(a).  Whether the state court reasonably determined that there was a strategic decision under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) is a different question from whether the strategic decision itself was a reasonable exercise of professional judgment under <em>Strickland</em> or whether the application of <em>Strickland</em> was reasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Cf. <em>Rice</em>, 546 U. S., at 342 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe question whether a state court errs in determining the facts is a different question from whether it errs in applying the law\xe2\x80\x9d).  These latter two questions may be \xe2\x80\x9c<em>related</em> to the one petitione[r] presented, and perhaps <em>complementary</em> to the one petitione[r] presented,\xe2\x80\x9d but they are \xe2\x80\x9cnot fairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U.

Without expressing a view on the ultimate reasonableness of the decision not to pursue this evidence further, we note that the Eleventh Circuit majority observed that the state court could reasonably have determined that counsel had strategic grounds for their decision.  In particular, evidence about Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies may have led to rebuttal testimony about the capabilities he demonstrated through his extensive criminal history, an extraordinarily limited amount of which was actually admitted at the penalty phase of the trial.  Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision successfully thwarted the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to admit evidence that Wood murdered his ex-girlfriend while on parole for an attempted murder of a different ex-girlfriend that was strikingly similar in execution to the subsequent successful murder.  App. 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  Moreover, as the Eleventh Circuit majority noted, evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies also could have undercut the defense\xe2\x80\x99s argument that he left school to support his family, suggesting instead that he left school because of educational difficulties.  542 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1305\xe2\x80\x931306.

Wood\xe2\x80\x99s experienced counsel made a perfectly sensible decision not to introduce Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s report into evidence or to call him as a witness.  That was a strategic decision based on their judgment that the evidence would do more harm than good.  But it does not follow from this single strategic decision that counsel also made a strategic decision to forgo investigating powerful mitigating evidence of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficits for the penalty phase.  On the contrary, the only reasonable factual conclusion I can draw from this record is that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do so was the result of inattention and neglect.  Because such a decision is the antithesis of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic\xe2\x80\x9d choice, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming that the Court is correct to decline to consider whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984) was reasonable, see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, the question whether the decision itself was the product of a strategy is still before us.  The Court may well be correct that the state court reasonably concluded that counsel made a decision not to pursue Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s report for either guilt or penalty phase purposes, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312, but to reject Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claim the state court also had to reasonably conclude that such a decision was borne of strategy.  And whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was the product of strategy is a question of fact for purposes of 28 U.

In other words, the Court correctly concludes that the record reasonably supports a finding that counsel decided not to investigate Wood\xe2\x80\x99s mental retardation further, but the Court fails to engage with the requisite second question: Does the record reasonably support finding that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision was a strategic one?

S. 362</a>, 396 (2000);<em> Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 688.  These cases also make clear that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unconsidered decision to fail to discharge that duty cannot be strategic.  The only conceivable strategy that might support forgoing counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ethical obligations under these circumstances would be a reasoned conclusion that further investigation is futile and thus a waste of valuable time.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 691 (recognizing that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s decision to abandon an investigation is entitled to deference \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no evidence in the record to suggest that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s counsel reached such a conclusion.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See 542 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1321\xe2\x80\x931322 (Barkett, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).  On the contrary, the Court recognizes that Wood has pointed to substantial evidence that Trotter, the attorney who had primary responsibility for Wood\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase, believed that further investigation had value, <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  Despite the fact that Trotter had a meager five months of experience as a lawyer when he was appointed to represent Wood, App. 261, even he knew that further investi-\ngation into any mental or psychological deficits was in order.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, any decision to abandon an investigation into the mitigating evidence signaled by Dr. Kirkland\xe2\x80\x99s report was so obviously unreasonable that the decision itself is highly persuasive evidence that counsel did not have any strategy in mind when they did so.  I share the view of my dissenting colleague below that the District Court correctly concluded that the failure to investigate was the product of inattention and neglect by attorneys preoccupied with other concerns and not the product of a deliberate choice between two permissible alternatives.  For the state court to conclude otherwise was thus \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court explains: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the state court reasonably determined that there was a strategic decision under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2) is a different question from whether the strategic decision itself was a reasonable exercise of professional judgment under <em>Strickland</em> or whether the application of <em>Strickland</em> was reasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  I agree with the majority that whether a particular strategic decision is reasonable or not is the <em>Strickland</em> question we would address were we reviewing Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claim for habeas relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, the law in the Eleventh Circuit on this point is well settled: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The question of whether an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s actions were actually the product of a tactical or strategic decision is an issue of fact \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Fotopoulos </em>v. <em>Secretary, Dept. of Corrections</em>, 516 F.\xc2\xa03d 1229, 1233 (CA11 2008) (quoting <em>Provenzano </em>v. <em>Singletary</em>, 148 F.\xc2\xa03d 1327, 1330 (CA11 1998)); see also <em>Lamarca</em> v. <em>Secretary, Dept. of Corrections</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 929, 938 (CA11 2009) (same).  Thus, it is quite understandable that Wood framed the questions presented in his petition for certiorari as arising under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although Wood does not fall within the class of individuals we identified in <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U.

My concern is that there is no evidence to support a conclusion that there was a strategic decision on the latter, which is a necessary prerequisite for counsel to make reasoned choices with respect to what evidence should go before the jury during the penalty phase of a capital trial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 522 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical decision to focus on [defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] voluntary confessions, because counsel had not \xe2\x80\x98fulfill[ed] their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 396)). </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Shortly before the penalty phase commenced, Trotter sent letters to his two more experienced co-counsel imploring that \xe2\x80\x9cwe should request an independent psychological evaluation\xe2\x80\x94even if that means asking for a postponement of the sentencing hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 343 (letter from Trotter to Dozier); <em>id.</em>, at 345 (letter from Trotter to Ralph).  Trotter attempted to procure Wood\xe2\x80\x99s school records and speak to his former special education teachers in order to obtain \xe2\x80\x9canything that would be able to be used as a mitigating factor,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 267 (testimony of Trotter), but he failed to follow up on a subpoena issued for the records and never spoke at length with any of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s teachers, <em>id.</em>, at 267\xe2\x80\x93268.  Notably, at least two of these former teachers were willing to testify on Wood\xe2\x80\x99s behalf at the state postconviction hearing, see <em>id.,</em> at 401\xe2\x80\x93421 (testimony of Maddox and Penn).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I would also reach the same conclusion were I to agree with the respondents and their <em>amici</em> that a habeas petitioner must pierce \xc2\xa72254(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s presumption of correctness with respect to state-court findings of fact before he can proceed to show he is entitled to relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).
