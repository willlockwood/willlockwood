These creditors, acting for themselves and all who should become "assentents," and making in writing a scheme of reorganization, to which other creditors might assent -- appointed certain persons, Seymour and others, to act as agents and trustees in the whole matter of all persons who chose to deliver their bonds to them for use in the contemplated purchase.

JUSTICE MILLER delivered its opinion.</p>\n<p>The petitioner does not show that he has such an interest in the matter as would justify the court to permit him to interfere.  He describes himself as equitable owner of certain bonds made by the La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Railroad Company.  These bonds were secured by a mortgage, and it was in a suit brought to foreclose that mortgage that the sale was had of which he complains.  The owner of these bonds, while the foreclosure proceedings were in progress, was Weed, who had deposited them with the agents of a company, which proposed to use them in buying the said road, at the sale under the decree of foreclosure.  These agents were invested by Weed with an absolute and full power to use the bonds in any manner, so that no money was required of Weed towards the purchase.  The sale was made, and the road purchased as proposed.  These bonds were used in the purchase.  The sale was confirmed by the district court and the purchasers placed in possession.  Long after all this was done, as the petitioner alleges, by purchase from Weed he became the equitable owner of the bonds.  Who was the legal owner, and what were the relative rights of the equitable and legal owners, or how anyone could be the owner when the bond had been cancelled or absorbed in paying for the road, we are not informed.</p>\n<p>We deem it sufficient to say that the petitioner, who had no interest in the matter at the time of the sale and confirmation, shows no right now to disturb what the parties who were interested have acquiesced in.</p>\n<p><em>Motion overruled.</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/68/405/case.html">Bronson v.
