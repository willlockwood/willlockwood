MARSHALL, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case involves challenges to United States Air Force regulations that require members of the service to obtain approval from their commanders before circulating petitions on Air Force bases.  The first question is whether the regulations violate the First Amendment.  The second question is whether prohibiting the unauthorized circulation of petitions to Members of Congress violates 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034, which proscribes unwarranted restrictions on a serviceman\'s right to communicate with a Member of Congress.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Air Force regulations recognize that Air Force personnel have the right to petition Members of Congress and other public officials.  Air Force Reg. 30-1(9) (1971).  The regulations, however, prohibit "any person within an Air Force facility" and "any [Air Force] member . . . in uniform or . . . in a foreign country" from soliciting signatures on a petition without first obtaining authorization from the appropriate commander.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  They also provide that</p>\n<p>"[n]o member </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 444 U. S. 350</a></p><p> of the Air Force will distribute or post any printed or written material . . . within any Air Force installation without permission of the commander. . . ."</p>\n<p>Air Force Reg. 35-15(3)(a)(1) (1970).  The commander can deny permission only if he determines that distribution of the material would result in</p>\n<p>"a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the Armed Forces, or material interference with the accomplishment of a military mission. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> 3515(3)(a)(2). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 444 U. S. 351</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Albert Glines was a captain in the Air Force Reserves.  While on active duty at the Travis Air Force Base in California, he drafted petitions to several Members of Congress and to the Secretary of Defense complaining about the Air Force\'s grooming standards. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Aware that he needed command approval in order to solicit signatures within a base, Glines at first circulated the petitions outside his base.  During a routine training flight through the Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, however, Glines gave the petitions to an Air Force sergeant without seeking approval from the base commander.  The sergeant gathered eight signatures before military authorities halted the unauthorized distribution.  Glines\' commander promptly removed him from active duty, determined that he had failed to meet the professional standards expected of an officer, and reassigned him to the standby reserves.  Glines then brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that the Air Force regulations requiring prior approval for the circulation of petitions violated the First Amendment and 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court granted Glines\' motion for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 444 U. S. 352</a></p><p> summary judgment and declared the regulations facially invalid.  <em>Glines v. Wade,</em> 401 F.Supp. 127 (1975). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the finding of facial invalidity.  <em>Glines v. Wade,</em> 586 F.2d 675 (1978). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Following its decision in an earlier case involving collective petitions to Members of Congress, the court first determined that the regulations violated 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The statute prohibits any person from restricting a serviceman\'s communication with Congress "unless the communication is unlawful or violates a regulation necessary to the security of the United States."  The Air Force regulations against unauthorized petitioning on any base did not satisfy the statutory standard, the court concluded, because the Government had not shown that such restraints on servicemen in Guam were necessary to the national security.  586 F.2d at 679.  Since 1034 did not cover Glines\' petition to the Secretary of Defense, the court next considered whether the regulations violated the First Amendment.  The court acknowledged that requirements of military discipline could justify otherwise impermissible restrictions on speech.  It held, however, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 444 U. S. 353</a></p><p> the Air Force regulations are unconstitutionally overbroad because they might allow commanders to suppress "virtually all controversial written material."  586 F.2d at 681.  Such restrictions the court concluded, "exceed anything essential to the government\'s interests."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari, 440 U.S. 957 (1979), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Greer v. Spock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html">424 U. S. 828</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#840">424 U. S. 840</a></span> (1976), MR. JUSTICE STEWART wrote for the Court that</p>\n<p>"nothing in the Constitution . . . disables a military commander from acting to avert what he perceives to be a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of troops on the base under his command."</p>\n<p>In that case, civilians who wished to distribute political literature on a military base challenged an Army regulation substantially identical to the Air Force regulations now at issue.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#831">424 U. S. 831</a></span>, and n. 2.  The civilians claimed that the Army regulation was an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, invalid on its face.  We disagreed.  We recognized that a base commander may prevent the circulation of material that he determines to be a clear threat to the readiness of his troops.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#837">424 U.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  For the same reasons, we now uphold the Air Force regulations. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 444 U.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Speech likely to interfere with these vital prerequisites for military effectiveness therefore can be excluded from a military base.  <em>Spock,</em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 444 U.

S. 848</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring).\n</em></p>\n<p>Like the Army regulation that we upheld in S<em>pock, </em>the Air Force regulations restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect the substantial governmental interest.  <em>See Procunier v. Martinez, supra.</em>  Both the Army and the Air Force regulations implement the policy set forth in Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 1325.6 (1969). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  That directive advises commanders to preserve servicemen\'s "right of expression . . . to the maximum extent possible, consistent with good order and discipline and the national security."  <em>Id.,</em> \xef\xbf\xbd II.  Thus, the regulations in both services prevent commanders from interfering with the circulation of any materials other than those posing a clear danger to military loyalty, discipline, or morale.  Air Force Reg. 35-15(3)(a)(2) (1970); Army Reg. 210-10, \xef\xbf\xbd 5-5(c) (1970); see DOD Dir. 1326.6, \xef\xbf\xbd III(A)(1) (1969).  Indeed, the Air Force regulations specifically prevent commanders from halting the distribution of materials that merely criticize the Government or its policies.  Air Force Reg. 35-15(3)(a)(4) (1970); <em>see</em> DOD Dir. 1325.6, \xef\xbf\xbd III(A)(3) (1969).  Under the regulations, Air Force commanders have no authority whatever to prohibit the distribution of magazines and newspapers through regular outlets such as the post exchange newsstands.  Air Force Reg. 35-15(3)(a)(1) (1970); <em>see</em> DOD Dir. 1325.6, \xef\xbf\xbd III(A)(1) (1969). [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Nor may they interfere with the "[d]istribution of publications and other materials through </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 444 U. S. 356</a></p><p> the United States mail. . . ."  Air Force Reg. 315(3)(a)(1) (1970).  The Air Force regulations also require any commander who prevents the circulation of materials within his base to notify his superiors of that decision.  Air Force Reg. 315(3)(a)(2) (1970); <em>see</em> Army Reg. 210-10, \xef\xbf\xbd 5(d) (1970).  <em>Spock</em> held that such limited restrictions on speech within a military base do not violate the First Amendment. 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#840">424 U. S. 840</a></span>; <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#848">424 U. S. 848</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring).</p>\n<p><em>Spock</em> also established that a regulation requiring members of the military services to secure command approval before circulating written materials within a military base is not invalid on its face.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#840">424 U. S. 840</a></span>. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Without the opportunity to review materials before they are dispersed throughout his base, a military commander could not avert possible disruptions among his troops.  Since a commander is charged with maintaining morale, discipline, and readiness, he must have authority over the distribution of materials that could affect adversely these essential attributes of an effective military force. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>"[T]he accuracy and effect of a superior\'s command </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 444 U.

Because the right to command and the duty to obey ordinarily must go unquestioned, this Court long ago recognized that the military must possess substantial discretion over its internal discipline.  <em>See, e.g., Schlesinger v.

In <em>Spock,</em> we found no facial constitutional infirmity in regulations that allow a commander to determine before distribution whether particular materials pose a clear danger to the good order of his troops.

Glines contends that this law protects the circulation of his collective petitions as well as the forwarding of individual communications.  We find his contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>Section 1034 was introduced as a floor amendment to the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951 in response to a specific and limited problem.  While Congress was debating the Act, Congressman Byrnes of Wisconsin learned that a young constituent seeking a hardship discharge from the Navy</p>\n<p>"had been told by his commanding officer . . . that a direct communication with his Congressman was prohibited and [that] it would make him subject to court-martial."</p>\n<p>97 Cong.Rec. 3776 (1951).

The Air Force regulations contain no such provision.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Glines would distinguish <em>Spock</em> on the ground that the plaintiffs in that case were civilians who had no specific right to enter a military base.  The distinction is unpersuasive.  Our decision in <em>Spock</em> rejected a facial challenge to a regulation that required "any person," civilian or military, to obtain prior permission for the distribution of literature within a base.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#831">424 U.

Furthermore, the military has greater authority over a serviceman than over a civilian.  <em>See Parker v. Levy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/733/case.html">417 U.

Loyalty, morale, and discipline are essential attributes of all military service.  Combat service obviously requires them.  And members of the Armed Services, wherever they are assigned, may be transferred to combat duty or called to deal with civil disorder or natural disaster.  Since the prior approval requirement supports commanders\' authority to maintain basic discipline required at nearly every military installation, it does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>"This Court has . . . repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down a statute on its face where there [are] a substantial number of situations to which it might be validly applied."</p>\n<p><em>Parker v.

Thus far, only the interest in averting a virtually certain prospect of imminent, severe injury to the Nation in time of war has been generally considered a sufficiently weighty ground for prior restraint of constitutionally protected speech.

The instant regulations, however, explicitly require commanding officers to suppress petitioning for reasons far less urgent than imminent, serious, peril to the United States or its citizens.  The maintenance of military discipline, morale, and efficiency are undeniably important, but they are not always, and in every situation, to be regarded as more compelling than a host of other governmental interests which we have found insufficient to warrant censorship.  <em>See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. United States, supra; Tinker v. Des Moines School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/case.html">393 U. S. 503</a></span> (1969); <em>see also Buckley v.

Time and again, the Court has underscored the principle that restraints upon communication must be hedged about by procedures that guarantee against infringement of protected expression and that eliminate the play of discretion that epitomizes arbitrary censorship.  <em>See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.

New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/147/case.html">308 U. S. 147</a></span> (1939).  We have identified specific safeguards that are indispensable if a system of prior approval is to avoid First Amendment pitfalls.  These include (1) the requirement that the burden of justifying censorship fall upon the censor, <em>see New York Times Co. v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/713/case.html#714">403 U. S. 714</a></span>; <em>Freedman v. Maryland, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/51/case.html#58">380 U. S. 58</a></span>, (2) the condition that administrative suppression must be subject to speedy judicial review, <em>see Blount v. Rizzi, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/410/case.html#417">400 U. S. 417</a></span>, and (3) the rule that those whose First Amendment interests are at stake be given notice and an opportunity to be heard during suppression proceedings, <em>see Carroll v. President &amp; Comm\'rs of Princess Anne, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/175/case.html#181">393 U. S. 181</a></span>-183; <em>cf. Procunier v. Martinez, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#417">416 U. S. 417</a></span>-419.</p>\n<p>None of these safeguards is present under the prior command approval scheme.  There is no indication that the burden of justifying censorship rests upon the authorities.  Not only does the commanding officer make his own determination to suppress, but also no provision is made for prompt judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 444 U. S. 367</a></p><p> review. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  And we search the regulations in vain for any provision affording the right to appear before the censoring officer to argue for approval.  Thus, the regulations utterly fail to meet even the minimum procedural dictates of the First Amendment; rather, as designed, they countenance the arbitrary and non-neutral suppression of communication by petition. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Third.</em>  The regulations demonstrably do not serve the military interests offered as their compelling justification, and, for that reason alone, violate the First Amendment.  If regulation of communicative rights is to be justified by a compelling governmental interest, the regulation must precisely further that interest; where constitutional rights are at stake, important ends do not sustain mismatched means.  <em>See Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/case.html#563">427 U. S. 563</a></span>-567,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/case.html#569">427 U. S. 569</a></span>; <em>Procunier v. Martinez, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#413">416 U. S. 413</a></span>.  In this respect, the regulations here plainly founder.  The most important purpose that can be posited for them is prevention of incitement to military disorder.  But if the danger of incitement necessitates prior clearance of servicemen\'s messages, it would be logical for the military to mandate preclearance of all messages, whether </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 444 U. S. 368</a></p><p> circulated by petition or disseminated orally.  Since oral discussion is not subjected to preliminary censorship, doubt must be raised as to the urgency and the efficacy of such censorship when communication is by petition.  In other words, inasmuch as the content of an oral communication may be identical to the content of a petition, there is no reason to single out petitions for a content preclearance requirement.</p>\n<p>The only rational basis for disparate treatment of petitioning and oral communication would be the presence of some danger <em>peculiar to the process of petitioning.</em>  But petitioning differs from simple oral expression only in that it involves an element of physical conduct.  Insofar as that physical element of the petitioning process poses a greater threat of disruption than does simple verbal expression, recourse to content-neutral regulation of the time, place, and manner of circulation is surely an appropriate and sufficient alternative to suppression.  By ordering prior official review of the content of petitions, these regulations are an excessive response to any distinctive problems of petitioning.  Even the most important governmental purpose cannot justify a regulation that unduly burdens First Amendment liberties.  <em>See Shelton v. Tucker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/479/case.html">364 U. S. 479</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/479/case.html#488">364 U. S. 488</a></span>-490 (1960).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>All that the Court offers to palliate these fatal constitutional infirmities is a series of platitudes about the special nature and overwhelming importance of military necessity. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/348/case.html#353">444 U. S. 353</a></span>-354. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 444 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Military (or national) security is a weighty interest, not least of all because national survival is an indispensable condition of national liberties.  <em>See United States v. Robel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/258/case.html">389 U. S. 258</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/258/case.html#264">389 U. S. 264</a></span> (1967).  But the concept of military necessity is seductively broad, and has a dangerous plasticity.  Because they invariably have the visage of overriding importance, there is always a temptation to invoke security "necessities" to justify an encroachment upon civil liberties.  For that reason, the military security argument must be approached with a healthy skepticism:  its very gravity counsels that courts be cautious when military necessity is invoked by the Government to justify a trespass on First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>Such skepticism lay at the heart of our decision in <em>New York Times Co. v. United States.</em>  There, the Government urged that publication of the so-called Pentagon Papers would damage the Nation\'s security during a period of armed conflict.  We rejected that assertion. 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/713/case.html#714">403 U. S. 714</a></span>.  Separate opinions scrutinized the security argument, and declined to rely merely upon the Government\'s characterization of the interest at stake.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/713/case.html#719">403 U.

Robel, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/258/case.html#263">389 U. S. 263</a></span>-264, spurned simple deference to "talismanic incantation[s]" of "\'war power.\'"  Analogously, we have stringently viewed the national security argument when it has been proffered to support domestic warrantless surveillance.  <em>United States v. United States District Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/297/case.html">407 U. S. 297</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/297/case.html#320">407 U. S. 320</a></span> (1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 444 U. S. 370</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To be sure, generals and admirals, not federal judges, are expert about military needs.  But it is equally true that judges, not military officers, possess the competence and authority to interpret and apply the First Amendment.  Moreover, in the context of this case, the expertise of military officials is, to a great degree, tainted by the natural self-interest that inevitably influences their exercise of the power to control expression.  Partiality must be expected when government authorities censor the views of subordinates, especially if those views are critical of the censors.  Larger, but vaguely defined, interests in discipline or military efficiency may all too easily become identified with officials\' personal or bureaucratic preferences.  This Court abdicates its responsibility to safeguard free expression when it reflexively bows before the shibboleth of military necessity.  <em>Cf. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/829/case.html">435 U. S. 829</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/829/case.html#842">435 U. S. 842</a></span>-845 (1978).</p>\n<p>A properly detached -- rather than unduly acquiescent -- approach to the military necessity argument here would doubtless have led the Court to a different result.  The military\'s omission to regulate the content of oral communication suggests the pointlessness of controlling the identical message when embodied in a petition.  It is further troubling that these regulations apply to all military bases, not merely to those that operate under combat or near-combat conditions.  The "front line" and the rear echelon may be difficult to identify in the conditions of modern warfare, but there is a difference between an encampment that faces imminent conflict and a military installation that provides staging, support, or training services.  It is simply impossible to credit the contention that national security is significantly promoted by the control of petitioning throughout all installations.</p>\n<p>Finally, and fundamentally, the Court has been deluded into unquestioning acceptance of the very flawed assumption that discipline and morale are enhanced by restricting peaceful communication of various viewpoints.  Properly regulated as </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 444 U. S. 371</a></p><p> to time, place, and manner, petitioning provides a useful outlet for airing complaints and opinions that are held as strongly by citizens in uniform as by the rest of society.  The forced absence of peaceful expression only creates the illusion of good order; underlying dissension remains to flow into the more dangerous channels of incitement and disobedience.  In that sense, military efficiency is only disserved when First Amendment rights are devalued.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court egregiously errs in holding that <em>Greer v. Spock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html">424 U. S. 828</a></span> (1976), compels the validation of these regulations.  I dissented in <em>Greer,</em> and continue to disagree with the decision in that case.  But, in any event, <em>Greer</em> is not dispositive here; indeed, if it governs at all in these cases, <em>Greer</em> is authority that the regulations are constitutionally indefensible.</p>\n<p><em>Greer</em> arose because of the rejection by military authorities of Dr. Benjamin Spock\'s request to hold a Presidential campaign meeting and distribute campaign literature at Fort Dix.  Although the case involved a number of Army regulations restricting various expressive activities -- including regulations parallel to those before us now -- the actual issue in <em>Greer</em> was the exclusion of a politically partisan campaign effort.  And there were three critical elements in <em>Greer</em> that prompted the Court to sustain that exclusion:</p>\n<p>First, the Court relied upon the proposition that civilians lack expressive rights on military reservations from which they can be excluded.  Significantly, the previous decision in <em>Flower v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/197/case.html">407 U. S. 197</a></span> (1972) (per curiam), was distinguished on the ground that leafletting in <em>Flower</em> had taken place on a portion of Fort Sam Houston that had been effectively dedicated to public use.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court noted that servicemen stationed at Fort Dix had easy access to off-base public fora where they could be exposed to communications by Dr. Spock and others.  By the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 444 U. S. 372</a></p><p> same token, although not discussed in <em>Greer,</em> these off-base fora provided Dr. Spock with ample opportunity for expressive activity.  Thus, from the standpoint of speaker and listeners, the Fort Dix regulations only effected a partial cutoff of communicative rights, because other equivalent avenues of interchange remained open.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Greer</em> repeatedly emphasized the lack of any claim that the Fort Dix regulations had been applied in biased fashion.  It explicitly noted the complete absence of any question of "irrationa[l], invidiou[s], or arbitrar[y]" application of the Army regulations.  424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#840">424 U. S. 840</a></span>.  Accordingly, the Court did not confront the problem of official discrimination among political viewpoints.  Indeed, <em>Greer</em> placed weight upon a perceived "American constitutional tradition" that the military be institutionally free of political entanglement, and that it avoid "the appearance of acting as a handmaiden for partisan political causes or candidates."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#839">424 U. S. 839</a></span>.</p>\n<p>These three predicates to <em>Greer</em> are wholly absent in the setting in which we review the regulations before us.  On their face, and as applied in these cases, the regulations restrict the expressive activities of individuals who are mandatorily, not permissively, present on military reservations.  For soldiers and sailors, as opposed to civilians, military installations must be the place for "free . . . communication of thoughts," <em>Greer v. Spock, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#838">424 U. S. 838</a></span>.  Further, when service personnel are stationed abroad or at sea, the base or warship is very likely the only place for free communication of thoughts. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Thus, in contrast to <em>Greer,</em> the regulations here permit complete foreclosure of a distinctive mode of expression by servicemen, who lack the civilian\'s option to depart the sphere of military authority.</p>\n<p>These cases also differ from <em>Greer</em> because they exemplify </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 444 U. S. 373</a></p><p> pervasive official partiality in the regulation of messages. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  The orders refusing command approval for respondents\' petitioning or leafletting flowed from the obviously biased official judgment that the content was "erroneous and misleading commentary," App. in No. 78-599, p. 34, or that it "impugn[ed] by innuendo the motives and conduct" of the President, <em>id.</em> at 46.  Far from being evenhanded regulation, this sort of command judgment is quintessentially political; in suppressing communication that "impugns" Presidential conduct "by innuendo," military authorities entangle themselves in national politics.  Since these cases involve discriminatory regulation of communication, <em>Greer\'s</em> assumption of military neutrality -- and, consequently, <em>Greer\'s</em> result -- cannot govern here.  Actually, the "tradition of a politically neutral military," <em>Greer, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/828/case.html#839">424 U. S. 839</a></span>, strongly counsels invalidation of these regulations, which demonstrably encourage commanding officers to exercise personal political judgment in deciding whether to permit petitioning.

Since the on-post/off-post distinction had not been considered dispositive with respect to other requests, <em>see id.</em> at 44, 46-47, it is difficult to identify the principle underlying the differing decisions about the leaflet.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/348/case.html#356">444 U.

JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Department of the Navy used to have a regulation mandating that every communication to a Member of Congress from anybody in the Navy had to be forwarded through official channels, if the communication "affect[ed] the Naval Establishment."  <em>See</em> 97 Cong.Rec. 3776 (1951).  Congress was informed about this regulation in 1951, and its reaction was to enact a statute that currently reads:</p>\n<p>"No person may restrict any member of an armed force in communicating with a member of Congress, unless the communication is unlawful or violates a regulation necessary to the security of the United States."</p>\n<p>10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court holds that this statute does not in any way protect the circulation by servicemen on United States military bases of petitions addressed to Members of Congress.  Specifically, the Court holds that the statute does not apply to a military regulation requiring that the content of petitions addressed to Members of Congress be precleared, [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] even when </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 444 U. S. 375</a></p><p> the petitioning activity occurs on a base located in a noncombat area in time of peace.  To reach this result, the Court necessarily concludes either that petitions are not "communication[s]" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1034 or that the compelled prescreening of petitions is not a "restrict[ion]" within the meaning of that statute.  Since, in my view, each of these conclusions is at odds with the express language of the statute and with its legislative history, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Section 1034 protects those servicemen who "communicat[e]" with Members of Congress.  As the Court necessarily acknowledges, a letter bearing one signature is a "communication" protected by \xc2\xa7 1034.  Nothing in logic would suggest that such a letter forfeits the statute\'s protection simply by acquiring additional signatures.  Accordingly, reason would indicate that petitions are a form of "communication" protected under \xc2\xa7 1034:  they are no more than letters bearing many signatures.  Moreover, it seems clear that a serviceman "communicates" with his Congressman just as much when he signs a letter drafted by a third person as when he writes and signs that letter himself.</p>\n<p>Yet the Court\'s opinion appears to conclude that petitions are not "communications" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1034.  To reach this conclusion, the Court relies on the statute\'s legislative history.  As the Court points out, the specific situation brought to the attention of Congress in 1951 was that of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 444 U. S. 376</a></p><p> serviceman who had been threatened with court-martial proceedings if he sent a letter to his Congressman without prior command approval.  By enacting the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1034, Congress made clear that it wanted to prohibit this kind of restraint.  But the legislative history cited by the Court shows that the purpose of the law was considerably broader than simply "to permit any man who is inducted to sit down and take a pencil and paper and write to his Congressman or Senator."  97 Cong.Rec. 3776 (1951).</p>\n<p>The historic matrix of the law contains no suggestion that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 1034 to cover no more than a letter written and signed by one individual person. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  If anything is to be drawn from \xc2\xa7 1034\'s history, it is that Congress intended to protect more than such single-signature letters.  A precise and particularized problem was brought to the attention of Congress in 1951, one that could easily have been remedied by a similarly circumscribed solution.  Congress chose instead to write broadly so as to accord protection to all "communications" sent by military personnel to Members of Congress.  Clearly, the legislative purpose was to cover the myriad of ways in which a citizen may communicate with his Congressman.  By limiting the scope of \xc2\xa7 1034 to the particular case brought to the attention of Congress in 1951, the Court, I think, reads the legislative history as mistakenly as it reads the language of the statute itself. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 444 U. S. 377</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion can be interpreted alternatively to hold that the regulations at issue do not constitute a "restrict[ion]" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1034.  That position also gives the statute an unjustifiably narrow scope.  An absolute ban of petitions or petitioning activity on military bases would obviously constitute a "restrict[ion]." [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  The regulations before us amount to such a ban, but with one difference.  They permit a limited exception for petitions whose content has been precleared by command authority.  This kind of exception, however, is precisely the type of "restrict[ion]" on the free flow of communication between servicemen and Congress that the law prohibits.  As stated by the law\'s sponsor, a requirement that a serviceman send his communications through channels "is a restriction in and of itself."  97 Cong.Rec. 3776 (1951).</p>\n<p>That the preclearance regulations at issue here restrict the free flow of communication between servicemen and Members of Congress could not be more clearly demonstrated than by the facts presented in <em>Secretary of Navy v. Huff, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/453/case.html">444 U. S. 453</a></span>.  There, servicemen invoked the preclearance procedures contained in similar regulations, but were denied permission to collect signatures on several petitions addressed to Members of Congress, which denials the Government now concedes were improper. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Not only did the prescreening procedure unjustifiably prevent the circulation of those particular petitions; it also necessarily discouraged further collective and individual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 444 U. S. 378</a></p><p> attempts by those servicemen to communicate with Congress.  It seems clear to me that the application of the challenged regulations in this case violated the provisions of \xc2\xa7 103.  Under that statute, only those rules that prohibit "unlawful" communications or that are "necessary to the security of the United States" may be enforced.  No claim is made here that the communicative content of any of the respondent\'s petitions was in any way "unlawful."  Moreover, no contention is made that the respondent disclosed anything secret or confidential in the proposed petitions to the Members of Congress. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  And surely it could not conceivably be argued that, as a general proposition, a regulation requiring the preclearance of the content of all petitions to be circulated by servicemen in time of peace is "necessary to the security of the United States."</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>On their face, the regulations at issue strongly suggest that the content of prospective petitions may be considered by the commanding officer in determining whether or not to grant servicemen permission to circulate the documents.  Air Force Reg. 315(3)(a) (170) requires that, in order to obtain permission to circulate any petition, a serviceman must submit to his commander "a copy of the material with a proposed plan or method of distribution or posting. . . ."  The regulation further provides that permission to distribute will be denied where the commander determines that "a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the Armed Forces, or material interference with the accomplishment of a military mission, would result."  Finally, the regulation admonishes the commander that "[d]istribution or posting may not be prohibited <em>solely</em> on the ground that the material is critical of Government policies or officials."  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Any doubt that the regulations involved here permit the appropriate commanding officer to review the contents of prospective petitions is dispelled by what occurred in <em>Secretary of Navy v. Huff, post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/453/case.html">444 U. S. 453</a></span>.  There, a commanding officer, acting under the authority of similar regulations, prohibited the circulation of petitions because they contained</p>\n<p>"gross misstatements and implications of law and fact as well as impugning by innuendo the motives and conduct of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that nothing in \xc2\xa7 1034\'s legislative history indicates that, when Congress drafted that provision, it had in mind the slightly different wording of 5 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 72 (1976 ed., Supp. II), which explicitly protects the petitioning rights of federal civil servants.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In support of its conclusion, the Court states:</p>\n<p>"The unrestricted circulation of collective petitions could imperil discipline.  We find no legislative purpose that requires the military to assume this risk, and no indication that Congress contemplated such a result."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/348/case.html#360">444 U. S. 360</a></span>.  Contrary to the Courts implication, a reading of \xc2\xa7 1034 to include petitions within that statutes ambit would not leave the military without the ability to protect its vital interests.  The statute expressly permits the promulgation of rules regulating communicative conduct if "necessary to the security of the United States."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/4" name="F3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Without some activity aimed at the acquisition of signatures, no petition could ever be created.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>Permission was denied to circulate a petition to Senator Cranston opposing the use of military personnel in labor disputes and a petition to Representative Dellums requesting amnesty for Vietnam war resisters, even though the requesters had stated that they would circulate the petitions out of uniform, during their off-duty hours, and away from the work areas of the base.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/6" name="F3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress included the "necessary to the security" exception in \xc2\xa7 1034 so that the Government could prohibit servicemen from imparting "secret matter" in their communications with Congress. 97 Cong.Rec. 3877 (1951).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The respondent was demoted to the standby reserves because he had failed to submit for preclearance a petition addressed to the Secretary of Defense as well as petitions separately addressed to various Members of Congress.  While the latter petitions were protected by 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034, the former was not.  I would nonetheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  There is no reason to believe that the respondent suffered the demotion only for his circulation of the petition addressed to the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The question whether 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1034 includes a right to circulate petitions is not an easy one for me.  I must confess that I think the plain language of the statute and its sparse legislative history slightly favor the Court\'s reading that it does not.  Nevertheless, I agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 444 U. S. 379</a></p><p> construction of the statute for two reasons.  First, in a doubtful case I believe a statute enacted to remove impediments to the flow of information to Congress should be liberally construed.  Second, the potentially far-reaching consequences of deciding the constitutional issue [<a href="#F4/1" name="T4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>] counsel avoidance of that issue if the "case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground." [<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  MR. JUSTICE STEWART has surely demonstrated that that test is met here.  I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated by MR.
