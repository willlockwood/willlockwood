It is alleged that the flour was not actually destined to the use of the enemy, but whether any part of it went to his use or not is immaterial.  It is indeed possible that Cadiz might have fallen without the aid of these supplies, and therefore, in fact, Great Britain and her ally may have been relieved by these supplies from the pressure of the war in that quarter.  The court, however, in the cases alluded to, proceeded on a broader ground:  all the judges who concurred in those decisions were of opinion that the mere sailing under an enemy\'s license, without regard to the object of the voyage or the port of destination, constituted of itself an act of illegality which subjected the property to confiscation.  It was an attempt by one individual of a belligerent country to clothe himself with a neutral character </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 15 U. S. 148</a></p><p> by the license of the other belligerent and thus to separate himself from the common character of his own country.</p>\n<p><em>Sentence affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
