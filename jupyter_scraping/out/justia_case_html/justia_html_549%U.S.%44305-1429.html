With the Bankruptcy Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval, PG&amp;E agreed to insert language into its reorganization plan and disclosure statement to protect Travelers in case of such a default.  Additional litigation over the negotiated language nevertheless ensued and was ultimately resolved by a court-approved stipulation stating, <em>inter alia,</em> that Travelers could assert a general unsecured claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, which were authorized in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 original indemnity agreements.  When Travelers filed an amended claim for such fees, PG&amp;E objected based on the rule the Ninth Circuit adopted in its prior <em>Fobian </em>decision that where the litigated issues involve not basic contract enforcement questions, but issues peculiar to federal bankruptcy law, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees generally will not be awarded.  The Bankruptcy Court rejected Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim on that basis, and the District Court and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Federal bankruptcy law does not disallow contract-based claims for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based solely on the fact that the fees were incurred litigating bankruptcy law issues.

Because Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees claim has nothing to do with the exceptions set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7502(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(9), it must be allowed unless it is unenforceable under \xc2\xa7502(b)(1), which disallows any claim that is \xe2\x80\x9cunenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Section 502(b)(1) is most naturally understood to provide that, with limited exceptions, any defense to a claim that is available outside of the bankruptcy context is also available in bankruptcy.

The <em>Fobian</em> court did not identify any Code provision as presenting such support, but instead cited three of its own prior decisions, none of which identified any basis for disallowing a contractual claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  Nor did the court have occasion to do so; in each of those cases, the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees claim failed as a matter of state law.  The absence of such textual support is fatal for the <em>Fobian</em> rule.   See <em>FCC</em> v. <em>NextWave Personal Communications Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/293/index.html">537 U.

In light of \xc2\xa7502(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s broad, permissive scope, and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe character of [a contractual] obligation to pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in bankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d it necessarily follows that the <em>Fobian </em>rule cannot stand. <em>Security Mortgage, supra</em>, at 154.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held, based on a rule previously adopted by that court, that such fees are categorically prohibited\xe2\x80\x94even where the contractual allocation of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees would be enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law\xe2\x80\x94to the extent the litigation involves issues of federal bankruptcy law.  Because that rule finds no support in the Bankruptcy Code, we vacate and\nremand.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in April 2001, 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101 <em>et seq</em>., and continued thereafter to operate its business as a \xe2\x80\x9cdebtor in possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71107(a), 1108.  The bankruptcy filing caught the attention of petitioner Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Travelers), which had previously issued a $100 million surety bond on PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s behalf to the California Department of Industrial Relations, guaranteeing PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s payment of state workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation benefits to injured employees.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In connection with the bond, PG&amp;E executed a series of indemnity agreements in favor of Travelers.  The indemnity agreements provide that PG&amp;E will be responsible for any loss Travelers might incur in connection with the bonds, including any attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred in pursuing, protecting, or litigating Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 rights in connection with those bonds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although no default occurred, Travelers asserted a claim in the bankruptcy action to protect itself in case PG&amp;E defaulted on its workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation benefits at some point in the future, requiring Travelers to make payments under its bond.  In response to Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim, and with the knowledge and approval of the Bankruptcy Court, PG&amp;E agreed to insert language into its reorganization plan and disclosure statement to protect Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 right to indemnity and subrogation in the event of a default by PG&amp;E.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Travelers claims, however, that PG&amp;E then unilaterally altered the negotiated language in a way that substantially diminished the protection it had been seeking.  According to Travelers, that development resulted in additional litigation, but Travelers and PG&amp;E ultimately resolved the dispute by entering into a stipulation that was later approved by the Bankruptcy Court.  In addition to accommodating Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 substantive concerns, the stipulation stated that Travelers \xe2\x80\x9cmay assert its claim for attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees under the [i]ndemnity [a]greements\xe2\x80\x9d (subject to PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s right to object) as a general unsecured claim against PG&amp;E.  Brief for Petitioner 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Travelers subsequently filed an amended proof of claim seeking to recover the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees it incurred in connection with PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy proceedings.  PG&amp;E objected, arguing that Travelers could not recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Bankruptcy Court agreed and rejected Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim on that basis.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\xe2\x80\x9325a.  Travelers appealed that ruling to the District Court.  The District Court affirmed, relying on <em>In\xc2\xa0re Fobian</em>, 951 F.\xc2\xa02d 1149 (CA9 1991), which held that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the litigated issues involve not basic contract enforcement questions, but issues peculiar to federal bankruptcy law, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees will not be awarded absent bad faith or harassment by the losing party,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1153.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a, 17a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Travelers appealed again, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  167 Fed. Appx. 593 (2006).  The panel acknowledged that, in at least some circumstances, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prevailing party in a bankruptcy proceeding may be entitled to an award of attorney fees in accordance with applicable state law . . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 594 (quoting <em>In\xc2\xa0re Baroff</em>, 105 F.\xc2\xa03d 439, 441 (CA9 1997)).  The panel nevertheless rejected Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim based on the <em>Fobian</em> rule, which it cited for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cattorney fees are not recoverable in bankruptcy for litigating issues \xe2\x80\x98peculiar to federal bankruptcy law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  167 Fed. Appx., at 594 (quoting <em>Fobian</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1153).  The panel explained that, because the fees claimed by Travelers were incurred litigating issues that were \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned entirely by federal bankruptcy law,\xe2\x80\x9d Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim necessarily failed.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  167 Fed.

Similarly, under the terms of the current Bankruptcy Code, it remains true that an otherwise enforceable contract allocating attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees (<em>i.e.</em>, one that is enforceable under substantive, nonbankruptcy law) is allowable in bankruptcy except where the Bankruptcy Code provides otherwise.  See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \xc2\xb6 506.04[3][a], p. 506\xe2\x80\x93118 (rev. 15th ed. 2006) (hereinafter Collier).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case requires us to consider whether the Bankruptcy Code disallows contract-based claims for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based solely on the fact that the fees at issue were incurred litigating issues of bankruptcy law.

Nor did it conclude that Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim was rendered unenforceable by any provision of the Bankruptcy Code.  To the contrary, the court acknowledged that, in at least some circumstances, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prevailing party in a bankruptcy proceeding may be entitled to an award of attorney fees in accordance with applicable state law . . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  167 Fed.

Appx., at 594 (quoting <em>Fobian</em>, 951 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1153).  The court explained that, because the fees claimed by Travelers were incurred litigating issues that were \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned entirely by federal bankruptcy law,\xe2\x80\x9d 167 Fed. Appx., at 594, Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim necessarily failed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Fobian</em> rule finds no support in the Bankruptcy Code, either in \xc2\xa7502 or elsewhere.  In <em>Fobian</em>, the court did not identify any provision of the Bankruptcy Code as providing support for the new rule.  See 951 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1153.  Instead, the court cited three of its own prior decisions, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Johnson</em>, 756 F.\xc2\xa02d 738 (1985); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Coast Trading Co.</em>, 744 F.\xc2\xa02d 686 (1984); and <em>In\xc2\xa0re Fulwiler</em>, 624 F.\xc2\xa02d 908 (1980)<em> (per curium)</em>.  Significantly, in none of those cases did the court identify any basis for disallowing a contractual claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred litigating issues of federal bankruptcy law.  Nor did the court have occasion to do so; in each of those cases, the claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees failed as a matter of state law.  See <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 741\xe2\x80\x93742; <em>Coast Trading</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 693; <em>Fulwiler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 910.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of textual support is fatal for the <em>Fobian</em> rule.  Consistent with our prior statements regarding creditors\xe2\x80\x99 entitlements in bankruptcy, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Raleigh</em>, 530 U. S., at 20, we generally presume that claims enforceable under applicable state law will be allowed in bankruptcy unless they are expressly disallowed.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7502(b).  Neither the court below nor PG&amp;E has offered any reason why the fact that the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in this case were incurred litigating issues of federal bankruptcy law overcomes that presumption.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 502(b)(4) is instructive on this point.  That provision expressly disallows claims for a particular category of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees\xe2\x80\x94those \xe2\x80\x9cfor services of an \xe2\x80\xa6 attorney of the debtor,\xe2\x80\x9d to the extent the claimed fees \xe2\x80\x9cexcee[d] the reasonable value of such services.\xe2\x80\x9d  The existence of that provision suggests that, in its absence, a claim for such fees would be allowed in bankruptcy to the extent enforceable under state law.  The absence of an analogous provision excluding the category of fees covered by the <em>Fobian</em> rule likewise suggests that the Code does not categorically disallow them.  See 4 Collier \xc2\xb6 506.04[3][a], at 506\xe2\x80\x93118 (concluding that <em>Fobian </em>\xe2\x80\x9cinverts the proper analysis\xe2\x80\x9d by allowing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only where they are expressly authorized by the Bankruptcy Code, and explaining that \xe2\x80\x9ca claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees arising in the context of litigating bankruptcy issues must be allowed if valid under applicable state law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress, of course, has the power to amend the Bankruptcy Code by adding a provision expressly disallowing claims for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred by creditors in the litigation of bankruptcy issues.  But because no such provision exists, the Bankruptcy Code provides no basis for disallowing Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim on the grounds stated by the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>FCC</em> v. <em>NextWave Personal Communications Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/293/index.html">537 U.

Here, the Bankruptcy Code does not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and expressly\xe2\x80\x9d compel courts to follow the <em>Fobian </em>rule; on the contrary, the Code says <em>nothing</em> about unsecured claims for contractual attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law.  In light of the broad, permissive scope of \xc2\xa7502(b)(1), and our prior recognition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe character of [a contractual] obligation to pay attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in bankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d it necessarily follows that the <em>Fobian </em>rule cannot stand. <em>Security Mortgage</em>, 278 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28 (conceding that PG&amp;E does not defend the <em>Fobian </em>rule, and acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Fobian<em> </em>rule is wrong . . . as to the distinction that it draws between State law and Federal litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, PG&amp;E argues that \xc2\xa7506(b) categorically disallows unsecured claims for contractual attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and\xe2\x80\x94noting that Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 claim is unsecured\xe2\x80\x94asks us to affirm on that basis.  Section 506(b) provides as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which \xe2\x80\xa6 is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement or State statute under which such claim arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7506(b) (Supp. 2006).</p>\n<p align="left">\nAccording to PG&amp;E, this provision authorizes claims for contractual attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the extent the creditor is oversecured, but disallows such claims to the extent the creditor is either not oversecured or (like Travelers) completely unsecured.  This reading of the Code, PG&amp;E argues, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a matter of negative implication, but of explicit negation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 18.  PG&amp;E also argues that the structure and purpose of the Bankruptcy Code, examined against the backdrop of pre-Code bankruptcy law, confirm that Congress did not intend to allow unsecured creditors to recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  See <em>id</em>., at 25\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PG&amp;E did not raise these arguments below.  Consequently, none of the lower courts had occasion to address them.  Nor were these arguments presented in PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s brief in opposition to certiorari.  PG&amp;E nevertheless insists that we should address these arguments as though they were \xe2\x80\x9cfairly included\xe2\x80\x9d within the question presented in Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 petition for certiorari.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41.  That contention appears to be premised on the theory that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Fobian rule reaches the correct conclusion in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough in \xe2\x80\xa6 preventing creditors from requiring other creditors to pay for their attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not persuaded.  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the lower courts regarding the <em>Fobian</em> rule, which is analytically distinct from, and fundamentally at odds with, PG&amp;E\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7506(b).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, we ordinarily do not consider claims that were neither raised nor addressed below, <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U.
