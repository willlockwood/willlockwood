S. 10</a></span> (Douglas, J., dissenting).  After the Philippines were liberated from Japanese occupation, in August 1945, George Ennis, the American Vice Consul in Manila, was designated to naturalize aliens pursuant to the 1940 Act.  Almost immediately after that, the Philippine Government began to express its concern that a mass migration of newly naturalized veterans would drain the country of essential manpower, undermining postwar reconstruction efforts in the soon-to-be independent country.  Accordingly, on September 13, 1945, the Commissioner recommended to Attorney General Clark that Vice Consul Ennis\'s naturalization authority be revoked. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  On October 26, 1945, Ennis was informed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="880">Page 486 U. S. 880</a></p><p> of that revocation.  For the next nine months, no official with \xc2\xa7 702 authority to receive and act upon petitions for naturalization was present in the Philippines, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) apparently taking the position that appointment of such an official was authorized, but not mandated.  Not until August, 1946, did the INS designate a new \xc2\xa7 702 official for the Philippines, who naturalized approximately 4,000 Filipinos before the December 31, 1946, expiration date of the 1940 Act.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Attorney General Clark\'s revocation of Vice Consul Ennis\'s naturalization authority during those nine months of 1945 and 1946 has led to a stream of litigation involving efforts by Filipino veterans to obtain naturalization under the expired 1940 Act.  In the suits we have before us here, all of the respondents except Mario Valderrama Litonjua and Bonifacio Lorenzana Manzano filed their petitions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  The INS has stipulated that all of these 14 respondents (the Pangilinan respondents) were eligible for naturalization under the 1940 Act and were present in the Philippines during the period from October, 1945, to August, 1946, though they had not taken affirmative steps to be naturalized before the cutoff date.  The naturalization examiner who handled these cases recommended against naturalization, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="881">Page 486 U. S. 881</a></p><p> and the District Court decided against naturalization, relying on the Second Circuit\'s decision in <em>Olegario.</em>  The naturalization petitions were consolidated for purposes of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p>Respondent Litonjua\'s petition for naturalization was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  Litonjua had served as a member of the United States Navy from May, 1941, to April, 1946, but had made no effort to apply for naturalization while on active duty.  He made preliminary efforts to obtain citizenship while working as a civilian employee of the United States Army in Seattle, Washington, after his discharge, but he did not complete the petition process before the December 31, 1946, cutoff date.  The naturalization examiner recommended against naturalization, and the District Court concurred, for reasons similar to those adopted by the District Court in <em>Pangilinan.</em></p>\n<p>Respondent Manzano also petitioned for naturalization in the Southern District of California.  His situation was the same as that of the <em>Pangilinan</em> respondents, except that he claims that, in July, 1946, after completing his military service, he specifically inquired at the American Embassy in the Philippines about the possibility of obtaining citizenship, but was told there was no longer anyone there to assist him.  The District Court, following the recommendation of the naturalization examiner, denied the petition for reasons similar to those adopted by the District Courts in <em>Pangilinan</em> and <em>Litonjua.</em></p>\n<p>The appeals of the <em>Pangilinan</em> respondents and Litonjua were filed in 1980 and 1981, and were consolidated by the Court of Appeals (No. 86-1992).  Manzano\'s appeal (No. 862019) was filed later and assigned to a different panel.  The Ninth Circuit initially decided the <em>Pangilinan-Litonjua</em> consolidated cases by relying on the collateral estoppel theory of its <em>Mendoza decision,</em> which had not yet been reversed by this Court.  We vacated that judgment in light of our ruling </p><p><a class="page-number" name="882">Page 486 U. S. 882</a></p><p> in <em>Mendoza. INS v. Litonjua,</em> 465 U.S. 1001 (1984), <em>vacating and remanding Barretto v. United States,</em> 694 F.2d 603 (CA9 1982).  On remand, the Ninth Circuit held that the revocation of Vice Consul Ennis\'s naturalization authority violated what it characterized as the mandatory language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 702 and 705 of the 1940 Act, and that the naturalization of the respondents was an appropriate equitable remedy.  <em>Pangilinan v. INS,</em> 796 F.2d 1091 (CA9 1986).  After this decision was announced, the panel in No. 86-2019 reversed and remanded to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the <em>Pangilinan</em> decision, characterizing the two cases as nearly identical.  In 86-1992, the INS\'s petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc was denied, with Judge Kozinski (writing for himself and seven others) dissenting.  <em>Pangilinan v.

Sections 701, 702, and 705 of the amended 1940 Act, set forth in the margin above, constitute a complete description of the extent of the liberalized naturalization rights conferred under that exclusive constitutional authority in 1942.  Section 701 explicitly limits the benefits to those who filed petitions no later than December 31, 1946.  Moreover, Congress has again exercised its exclusive constitutional power to provide that any petition for naturalization filed on or after September </p><p><a class="page-number" name="883">Page 486 U.

Since all the petitions for naturalization in this case were filed after December 31, 1946, and even after September 26, 1961, it is incontestable (and uncontested) that respondents have no statutory right to citizenship.</p>\n<p>In <em>INS v. Hibi,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/5/case.html">414 U. S. 5</a></span> (1973), we summarily reversed the holding of the Ninth Circuit that the same official acts alleged here gave rise to an estoppel that prevented the Government from invoking the December 31, 1946, cutoff in the 1940 Act.  We said that normal estoppel rules applicable to private litigants did not apply to the INS, since,</p>\n<p>"in enforcing the cutoff date established by Congress, as well as in recognizing claims for the benefits conferred by the Act, [the INS] is enforcing the public policy established by Congress."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/5/case.html#8">414 U. S. 8</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although the Ninth Circuit\'s holding in the present cases rests upon a somewhat different theory -- not that estoppel eliminates the effectiveness of the December 31, 1946, cutoff, but that equitable authority to craft a remedy enables the conferral of citizenship despite that cutoff -- we think our reasoning in <em>Hibi</em> quite clearly produces the same result.  The reason we expressed why estoppel could not be applied, <em>viz.,</em> that that doctrine could not override a "public policy established by Congress," surely applies as well to the invocation of equitable remedies.  Even assuming the truth of the Ninth Circuit\'s unsupported assertion that, "[i]n reviewing naturalization petitions, federal courts sit as courts of equity," 796 F.2d at 1102, it is well established that "[c]ourts of equity can no more disregard statutory and constitutional requirements and provisions than can courts of law."  <em>Hedges v.

Besides the explicit cutoff date in the 1940 Act, Congress in 1948, adopted a new liberalized citizenship program that excluded Filipino servicemen, and specifically provided that even applications timely filed under the 1940 Act and still pending would be adjudged under the new provisions.

(It is particularly absurd to contemplate that Filipinos who actually filed their applications before the 1946 cutoff were denied citizenship by reason of this provision, whereas the present respondents, who filed more than 30 years after the deadline, were awarded it by the Ninth Circuit.)  Finally, in 1961, Congress amended the 1952 Act by adding \xc2\xa7 310(e), 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1421(e), which specifies that "any" petition thereafter filed will be adjudged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="885">Page 486 U.

Neither by application of the doctrine of estoppel, nor by invocation of equitable powers, nor by any other means does a court have the power to confer citizenship in violation of these limitations.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents advance as an alternative ground for affirmance the claim that Attorney General Clark\'s revocation of Vice Consul Ennis\'s naturalization authority deprived them of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and under its equal protection component.  <em>See Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/88/case.html">426 U. S. 88</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/88/case.html#100">426 U. S. 100</a></span> (1976).  Assuming that these respondents can properly invoke the protections of the United States Constitution, and granting that they are members of a special class that Congress intended to favor with statutory entitlements to naturalization, they were not deprived of those entitlements without due process.  First, it did not violate due process for Congress to impose a reasonable limitations period upon the filing of naturalization petitions.  <em>Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/422/case.html">455 U. S. 422</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/422/case.html#437">455 U. S. 437</a></span> (1982).  Second, even assuming that a reasonable opportunity to file for naturalization was required, respondents were accorded at least that.  Unlike noncitizen servicemen in other parts of the world, they had the continuous presence of a \xc2\xa7 702 naturalization officer in the Philippines from August, 1945, through October, 1945, and from August, 1946, to the end of that year.  In this last period, the officer naturalized approximately 4,000 Filipinos.  In addition, approximately another 7,000 Filipinos were naturalized either in this country or by naturalization officers traveling post to post around the world.  We do not agree with respondents\' contention that, in addition to these ample opportunities, respondents were entitled as a matter of due process to individualized notice of any statutory rights and to the continuous presence of a naturalization officer in the Philippines from October, 1945, until July, 1946. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="886">Page 486 U. S. 886</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We also reject the possibility of a violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment\'s Due Process Clause.  The approximately 7-month presence of a naturalization officer in the Philippines not only met the applicable standard of equal protection, but indeed compared favorably with the merely periodic presence of such officers elsewhere in the world.  <em>See generally Fiallo v. Bell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/787/case.html">430 U. S. 787</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/787/case.html#792">430 U. S. 792</a></span> (1977); <em>Mathews v. Diaz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/67/case.html">426 U. S. 67</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/67/case.html#79">426 U. S. 79</a></span>-83 (1976).  Moreover, beyond the absence of any unequal treatment, the historical record lends no support whatever to the contention that the actions at issue here were motivated by any racial animus.  Indeed, it is fair to assume that the Filipino soldiers who fought so valiantly during the early months of World War II were regarded with especial esteem when this legislation was enacted and implemented.  Every court to consider this matter has observed that Attorney General Clark\'s and Commissioner Carusi\'s decisions were taken in response to the concerns of Philippine officials that their nation would suffer a manpower drain, and not because of hostility towards Filipinos.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em>  Thousands of Filipinos were naturalized outside the Philippines during the period in question, and approximately 4,000 more in the Philippines after a successor to Ennis was appointed in August, 1946.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondents Litonjua and Manzano argue that the Government cannot prevail in their cases, even if it prevails with respect to the 14 Pangilinan respondents, because it did not introduce any evidence in their cases concerning the historical events at issue.  This argument fails, since "it has been universally accepted that the burden is on the alien applicant to show his eligibility for citizenship in every respect," <em>Berenyi v. District Director, INS,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/630/case.html">385 U. S. 630</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/630/case.html#637">385 U. S. 637</a></span> (1967).  We also reject respondent Litonjua\'s assertion that his claim should be treated differently because he is within that category of veterans ("Category I" as described in <em>Matter of </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="887">Page 486 U. S. 887</a></em></p><p><em> Naturalization of 68 Filipino War Veterans,</em> 406 F.Supp. 931, 937-940 (ND Cal.1975)) whose petitions it has been the policy of the Government not to oppose.  That category includes only veterans who had taken some affirmative steps to obtain naturalization both before the December 31, 1946, cutoff date, and while they were still on active duty.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Litonjua made his first efforts after he was no longer on active duty with the Armed Forces.</p>\n<p>We have considered Litonjua\'s and Manzano\'s other separate claims, and have found none that is meritorious.</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN concurs in the result.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The two cases actually involve three lawsuits:  two appeals (both part of No. 86-1992) that were consolidated in the Court of Appeals (<em>Pangilinan v.
