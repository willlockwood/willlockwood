S. 369</a></span>.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents a question of statutory construction:  whether 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V) authorizes a convicted person to assert a claim for damages against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at his criminal trial.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that witnesses are absolutely immune from damages liability based on their testimony, and rejected the petitioners\' contention that government officials who testify about the performance of their official duties may be held liable under \xc2\xa7 1983 even if other witnesses may not.  We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals heard argument in three separate cases raising the absolute immunity issue, and decided them in a single opinion.  Two of these cases are before us on a writ of certiorari.  Petitioner Briscoe was convicted in state court of burglarizing a house trailer.  He then filed a \xc2\xa7 1983 complaint against respondent LaHue, a member of the Bloomington, Indiana, police force, alleging that LaHue had violated his constitutional right to due process by committing perjury in the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] LaHue had testified that, in his opinion, Briscoe was one of no more than 50 to 100 people in Bloomington whose prints would match a partial thumbprint on a piece of glass found at the scene of the crime.  According to Briscoe, the testimony was false, because the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the state police considered the partial print too incomplete to be of value, and, without the print, there was no evidence identifying him as the burglar.  He sought $100,000 in damages.  The District Court granted LaHue\'s motion for summary judgment on four separate grounds:  (1) the facts alleged in the complaint did not suggest that LaHue had testified falsely; (2) allegations of perjury alone are insufficient to state a constitutional claim; (3) LaHue had not testified "under color of law"; and (4) Briscoe\'s claim was collaterally estopped by his criminal conviction.</p>\n<p>Petitioners Vickers and Ballard were jointly tried and convicted of sexual assault in state court.  They subsequently brought a civil action under \xc2\xa7 1983 against respondent Hunley, a member of the Cedar Lake, Indiana, police force, alleging that he had deprived them of their constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.  They alleged that, by giving false testimony suggesting that they had been able to harmonize their stories before making exculpatory statements to police, he had prejudicially diminished the credibility of those statements.  Each plaintiff sought $150,000 in compensatory and $50,000 in punitive damages.  The Federal Magistrate granted a motion to dismiss the complaint on alternative grounds:  (1) Hunley had not testified "under color of law"; (2) he was entitled to absolute witness immunity; and (3) petitioners had failed to state a claim under \xc2\xa7 1983 because they did not allege that the prosecutor had knowingly used false testimony.  The District Court affirmed the dismissal on the first ground.  Both cases were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 460 U. S. 328</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although other issues were argued in the Court of Appeals, its holding in both cases was predicated squarely on the ground that, in litigation brought under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), all witnesses -- police officers as well as lay witnesses -- are absolutely immune from civil liability based on their testimony in judicial proceedings.  663 F.2d 713 (1981). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Because of the importance of the immunity question, which has given rise to divergent conclusions in the Courts of Appeals, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] we granted certiorari.  455 U.S. 1016 (1982). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 460 U. S. 329</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Before confronting the precise question that this case presents -- whether \xc2\xa7 1983 creates a damages remedy against police officers for their testimony as witnesses -- we begin by considering the potential liability of lay witnesses, on the one hand, and of judges and prosecutors who perform integral functions in judicial proceedings, on the other hand.  The unavailability of a damages remedy against both of these categories sheds considerable light on petitioners\' claim that Congress intended police officer witnesses to be treated differently.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>There are two reasons why \xc2\xa7 1983 does not allow recovery of damages against a private party for testimony in a judicial proceeding.  First, \xc2\xa7 1983 does not create a remedy for all conduct that may result in violation of "rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws."  Its reach is limited to actions taken "under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory. . . ." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  It is beyond question that, when a private </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 460 U. S. 330</a></p><p> party gives testimony in open court in a criminal trial, that act is not performed "under color of law." [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, since 1951, when this Court decided <em>Tenney v. Brandhove,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html">341 U. S. 367</a></span>, it has been settled that the all-encompassing language of \xc2\xa7 1983, referring to "[e]very person" who, under color of law, deprives another of federal constitutional or statutory rights, is not to be taken literally. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>"It is by now well settled that the tort liability created by \xc2\xa7 1983 cannot be understood in a historical vacuum. . . .  One important assumption underlying the Court\'s decisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar with common law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to the contrary."</p>\n<p><em>City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/247/case.html">453 U.

S. 554</a></span> (1967).</p>\n<p>The immunity of parties and witnesses from subsequent damages liability for their testimony in judicial proceedings [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 460 U. S. 331</a></p><p> was well established in English common law.  <em>Cutler v. Dixon,</em> 4 Co.Rep. 14b, 76 Eng.Rep. 886 (Q.B. 1585); <em>Anfield v. Feverhill,</em> 2 Bulst. 269, 80 Eng.Rep. 1113 (K.B. 1614); <em>Henderson v. Broomhead,</em> 4 H. &amp; N. 569, 578, 157 Eng.Rep. 964, 968 (Ex. 1859); [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] <em>see Dawkins v. Lord Rokeby,</em> 4 F. &amp; F. 806, 833-834, 176 Eng.Rep. 800, 812 (C. P. 1866).  Some American decisions required a showing that the witness\' allegedly defamatory statements were relevant to the judicial proceeding, but once this threshold showing had been made, the witness had an absolute privilege. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 460 U. S. 332</a></p><p> plaintiff could not recover even if the witness knew the statements were false and made them with malice. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>In the words of one 19th-century court, in damages suits against witnesses,</p>\n<p>"the claims of the individual must yield to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="333">Page 460 U. S. 333</a></p><p> the dictates of public policy, which requires that the paths which lead to the ascertainment of truth should be left as free and unobstructed as possible."</p>\n<p><em>Calkins v. Sumner,</em> 13 Wis.193, 197 (1860).  A witness\' apprehension of subsequent damages liability might induce two forms of self-censorship.  First, witnesses might be reluctant to come forward to testify.  <em>See Henderson v. Broomhead, supra,</em> at 578-579, 157 Eng.Rep. at 968.  And once a witness is on the stand, his testimony might be distorted by the fear of subsequent liability.  <em>See Barnes v. McCrate,</em> 32 Me. 442, 446-447 (1851).  Even within the constraints of the witness\' oath, there may be various ways to give an account or to state an opinion.  These alternatives may be more or less detailed, and may differ in emphasis and certainty.  A witness who knows that he might be forced to defend a subsequent lawsuit, and perhaps to pay damages, might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff, to magnify uncertainties, and thus to deprive the finder of fact of candid, objective, and undistorted evidence.  <em>See</em> Veeder, Absolute Immunity in Defamation:  Judicial Proceedings, 9 Colum.L.Rev. 463, 470 (1909). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But the truthfinding process is better </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 460 U. S. 334</a></p><p> served if the witness\' testimony is submitted to</p>\n<p>"the crucible of the judicial process, so that the factfinder may consider it, after cross-examination, together with the other evidence in the case to determine where the truth lies."</p>\n<p><em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#440">424 U. S. 440</a></span> (1976) (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>At least with respect to private witnesses, it is clear that \xc2\xa7 1983 did not abrogate the absolute immunity existing at common law, and petitioners do not contend otherwise.  Like the immunity for legislators at issue in <em>Tenney v. Brandhove,</em> the common law\'s protection for witnesses is "a tradition so well grounded in history and reason" that we cannot believe that Congress impinged on it "by covert inclusion in the general language before us."  341 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#376">341 U. S. 376</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court has already addressed the question whether \xc2\xa7 1983 permits damages recoveries from judges, prosecutors, and other persons acting "under color of law" who perform official functions in the judicial process.  Again, we have found that, in light of common law immunity principles, \xc2\xa7 1983 did not impose liability on these officials.  We have held that state judges are absolutely immune from liability for their judicial acts, <em>Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967); <em>Stump v. Sparkman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/349/case.html">435 U. S. 349</a></span> (1978), and that state prosecutors have absolute immunity from liability for their actions in initiating prosecutions, <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The central focus of our analysis has been the nature of the judicial proceeding itself.  Thus, in his opinion concurring in the judgment in <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra,</em> JUSTICE WHITE explained that the absolute immunity of public prosecutors was "based on the policy of protecting the judicial process."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="335">Page 460 U. S. 335</a></p><p> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#439">424 U. S. 439</a></span>.  He explained that this protection extended equally to other participants, including counsel and witnesses.</p>\n<p>"The reasons for this rule are also substantial.  It is precisely the function of a judicial proceeding to determine where the truth lies.  The ability of courts, under carefully developed procedures, to separate truth from falsity, and the importance of accurately resolving factual disputes in criminal (and civil) cases are such that those involved in judicial proceedings should be \'given every encouragement to make a full disclosure of all pertinent information within their knowledge.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The common law\'s protection for judges and prosecutors formed part of a "cluster of immunities protecting the various participants in judge-supervised trials," which stemmed "from the characteristics of the judicial process."  <em>Butz v. Economou,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html">438 U. S. 478</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#512">438 U. S. 512</a></span> (1978); <em>cf. King v. Skinner,</em> Lofft 54, 56, 98 Eng.Rep. 529 (K. B. 1772) ("[N]either party, witness, counsel, jury, or judge can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office").  The common law recognized that</p>\n<p>"controversies sufficiently intense to erupt in litigation are not easily capped by a judicial decree.  The loser in one forum will frequently seek another. . . .  Absolute immunity is thus necessary to assure that judges, advocates, and witnesses can perform their respective functions without harassment or intimidation."</p>\n<p><em>Butz, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#512">438 U. S. 512</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In short, the common law provided absolute immunity from subsequent damages liability for all persons -- governmental or otherwise -- who were integral parts of the judicial process.  It is equally clear that \xc2\xa7 1983 does not authorize a damages claim against private witnesses, on the one hand, or against judges or prosecutors in the performance of their respective duties, on the other.  When a police officer appears as a witness, he may reasonably be viewed as acting like any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="336">Page 460 U. S. 336</a></p><p> other witness sworn to tell the truth -- in which event, he can make a strong claim to witness immunity; [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] alternatively, he may be regarded as an official performing a critical role in the judicial process, in which event he may seek the benefit afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding.  Nothing in the language of the statute suggests that such a witness belongs in a narrow, special category lacking protection against damages suits.  We must ask, however, whether anything in the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 points to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners point to a number of references throughout the debates on the 1871 Act to widespread perjury by Ku Klux Klan witnesses in state criminal trials. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  They urge that, because perjury was one of the specific evils with which Congress was concerned, recognizing an absolute immunity for witnesses would conflict with congressional intent.  We find this argument unpersuasive.  The Act consisted of several sections establishing different remedies for disorder and violence in the Southern States. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  The legislative history and statutory language indicate that Congress intended perjury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="337">Page 460 U. S. 337</a></p><p> leading to unjust acquittals of Klan conspirators to be prohibited by \xc2\xa7 2, the civil and criminal conspiracy section of the statute, now codified in relevant part at 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1985(3) (1976 ed., Supp. V) and 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 241.  But the language of \xc2\xa7 1 -- now codified as \xc2\xa7 1983 -- differs from that of \xc2\xa7 2 in essential respects, and we find no evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the traditional common law witness immunity in \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.</p>\n<p>The Ku Klux Act, 17 Stat. 13, was enacted on April 20, 1871, less than a month after President Grant sent a dramatic message to Congress describing the breakdown of law and order in the Southern States.

During the debates, supporters of the bill repeatedly described the reign of terror imposed by the Klan upon black citizens and their white sympathizers in the Southern States.  Hours of oratory were devoted to the details of Klan outrages -- arson, robbery, whippings, shootings, murders, and other forms of violence and intimidation -- often committed in disguise and under cover of night.  These acts of lawlessness went unpunished, legislators asserted, because Klan members and sympathizers controlled or influenced the administration of state criminal justice.  In particular, it was alleged that Klan members were obligated, by virtue of membership in the organization, to protect fellow members who were charged with criminal activity.  They had a duty to offer themselves for service on grand and petit juries, and to violate their jurors\' oaths by refusing to indict or to convict regardless of the strength of the evidence.  They also were bound to appear as witnesses, and again to violate their oaths by committing perjury, if necessary, to exculpate their Klan colleagues. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Perjury was thus one of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="338">Page 460 U. S. 338</a></p><p> means by which the Klan prevented state courts from gaining convictions of Klan members for crimes against blacks and Republicans.</p>\n<p>It is clear from the legislative debates that, in the view of the Act\'s sponsors, the victims of Klan outrages were deprived of "equal protection of the laws" if the perpetrators systematically went unpunished. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Proponents of the measure repeatedly argued that, given the ineffectiveness of state law enforcement and the individual\'s federal right to "equal protection of the laws," an independent federal remedy was necessary and Congress had the power to provide it. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  <em>See Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#174">365 U. S. 174</a></span> (1961).</p>\n<p>Section 2 was designed specifically to provide criminal and civil remedies in federal court for the conspiratorial activities of the Klan.  Indeed, the provision singles out those who "go in disguise upon the public highway."  Earlier versions of the section enumerated precisely the activities that had been attributed to the Klan -- murder, manslaughter, mayhem, robbery, assault and battery, perjury, subornation of perjury, criminal obstruction of legal process or resistance of officers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 460 U. S. 339</a></p><p> in discharge of official duty, arson, or larceny.  Cong.Globe, <em>supra,</em> at 317.  The more general language in the final version of \xc2\xa7 2 was also intended to apply to the abuses that had been described repeatedly in congressional debate. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Part of the provision is particularly well tailored to reach conspiracies to commit perjury in order to prevent punishment of fellow Klansmen.  It provides penalties whenever two or more persons shall</p>\n<p>"conspire together . . . for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State from giving or securing to all persons within such State the equal protection of the laws, or shall conspire together for the purpose of in any manner impeding, hindering, obstructing, or defeating the due course of justice in any State or Territory, with intent to deny to any citizen of the United States the due and equal protection of the laws. . . . [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]"</p>\n<p>This evidence does not, however, tend to show that Congress intended to abrogate witness immunity in civil actions under \xc2\xa7 1, which applied to wrongs committed "under color of . . . law."  The bill\'s proponents were exclusively concerned with perjury resulting in unjust <em>acquittals</em> -- perjury likely to be committed by private parties acting in furtherance of a conspiracy -- and not with perjury committed "under color of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 460 U. S. 340</a></p><p> law" that might lead to unjust <em>convictions.</em>  In hundreds of pages of debate, there is no reference to the type of alleged constitutional deprivation at issue in this case:  perjury by a <em>government official</em> leading to an unjust conviction.  Indeed, the legislative history is virtually silent even with regard to perjury by <em>private</em> persons leading to convictions of innocent defendants. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  There is a simple enough reason for this lacuna:  the Klan had other, more direct, means of dealing with its victims.  A "reign of terrorism and bloodshed" did not require the formal processes of law; at most, drumhead tribunals were convened at dead of night. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Even when the organization\'s intended victims had been taken into custody and charged with crimes, the evidence before Congress suggested that the Klan resorted to vigilante justice, rather than courtroom perjury. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>In summary, the legislative history supports criminal punishment under \xc2\xa7 2 for a witness who conspired to give perjured testimony favorable to a defendant, with the effect of preventing effective enforcement of the laws, and liability in a civil suit against the perjured witness by the defendant\'s victim.  But these are not the issues before us today.  We are asked to extrapolate from pro-defendant perjury to pro-prosecution perjury, and if willing to make that step, we are further invited to apply legislative history relating to \xc2\xa7 2 -- a section specifically directed toward private conspiracies -- to \xc2\xa7 1 -- a section designed to provide remedies for abuses under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="341">Page 460 U. S. 341</a></p><p> color of law.  We decline the invitation.  The debates of the 42d Congress do not support petitioners\' contention that Congress intended to provide a \xc2\xa7 1 damages remedy against police officers or any other witnesses. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners, finally, urge that we should carve out an exception to the general rule of immunity in cases of alleged perjury by police officer witnesses. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  They assert that the reasons supporting common law immunity -- the need to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="342">Page 460 U. S. 342</a></p><p> avoid intimidation and self-censorship -- apply with diminished force to police officers.  Policemen often have a duty to testify about the products of their investigations, and they have a professional interest in obtaining convictions which would assertedly counterbalance any tendency to shade testimony in favor of potentially vindictive defendants.  In addition, they are subject to \xc2\xa7 1983 lawsuits for the performance of their other duties, as to which they have only qualified immunity, and their defense is generally undertaken by their governmental employers.  Further, petitioners urge that perjured testimony by police officers is likely to be more damaging to constitutional rights than such testimony by ordinary citizens, because the policeman in uniform carries special credibility in the eyes of jurors.  And, in the case of police officers, who cooperate regularly with prosecutors in the enforcement of criminal law, prosecution for perjury is alleged to be so unlikely that it is not an effective substitute for civil damages.</p>\n<p>These contentions have some force.  But our cases clearly indicate that immunity analysis rests on functional categories, not on the status of the defendant. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  A police officer on the witness stand performs the same functions as any other witness; he is subject to compulsory process, takes an oath, responds to questions on direct examination and cross-examination, and may be prosecuted subsequently for perjury.</p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent that traditional reasons for witness immunity are less applicable to governmental witnesses, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="343">Page 460 U. S. 343</a></p><p> other considerations of public policy support absolute immunity more emphatically for such persons than for ordinary witnesses.  Subjecting government officials, such as police officers, to damages liability under \xc2\xa7 1983 for their testimony might undermine not only their contribution to the judicial process, but also the effective performance of their other public duties.</p>\n<p>Section 1983 lawsuits against police officer witnesses, like lawsuits against prosecutors, "could be expected with some frequency."  <em>Cf. Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#425">424 U. S. 425</a></span>.  Police officers testify in scores of cases every year, and defendants often will transform resentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury by the State\'s official witnesses.  As the files in this case show, even the processing of a complaint that is dismissed before trial consumes a considerable amount of time and resources. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>This category of \xc2\xa7 1983 litigation might well impose significant burdens on the judicial system and on law enforcement resources.  As this Court noted when it recognized absolute immunity for prosecutors in <em>Imbler,</em> if the defendant official</p>\n<p>"could be made to answer in court each time [a disgruntled defendant] charged him with wrongdoing, his energy and attention </p><p><a class="page-number" name="344">Page 460 U. S. 344</a></p><p> would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law."</p>\n<p>424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#425">424 U. S. 425</a></span>.  To some degree, the individual\'s burden might be alleviated by the government\'s provision of counsel, but a case that goes to trial always imposes significant emotional and other costs on every party litigant.</p>\n<p>It is not sufficient to assert that the burdens on defendants and the courts could be alleviated by limiting the cause of action to those former criminal defendants who have already vindicated themselves in another forum, either on appeal or by collateral attack.  We rejected a similar contention in <em>Imbler.</em>  Petitioner contended that</p>\n<p>"his suit should be allowed, even if others would not be, because the District Court\'s issuance of the writ of habeas corpus shows that his suit has substance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#428">424 U. S. 428</a></span>, n. 27.  We declined to carve out such an exception to prosecutorial immunity, noting that petitioner\'s success in a collateral proceeding did not necessarily establish the merits of his civil rights action.  Moreover, we noted that</p>\n<p>"using the habeas proceeding as a \'door-opener\' for a subsequent civil rights action would create the risk of injecting extraneous concerns into that proceeding."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  We emphasized that, in determining whether to grant postconviction relief, the tribunal should focus solely on whether there was a fair trial under law.</p>\n<p>"This focus should not be blurred by even the subconscious knowledge that a post-trial decision in favor of the accused might result in the prosecutor\'s being called upon to respond in damages for his error or mistaken judgment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#427">424 U. S. 427</a></span>.  The same danger exists in the case of potential liability for police officer witnesses. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="345">Page 460 U. S. 345</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is, of course, the possibility that, despite the truthfinding safeguards of the judicial process, some defendants might indeed be unjustly convicted on the basis of knowingly false testimony by police officers. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  The absolute immunity for prosecutors recognized in <em>Imbler</em> bars one possible avenue of redress for such defendants.  Similarly, in this case, the absolute witness immunity bars another possible path to recovery for these defendants.  But we have recognized, again and again, that in some situations, the alternative of limiting the official\'s immunity would disserve the broader public interest.  As Judge Learned Hand wrote years ago:</p>\n<p>"As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative.  In this instance, it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation."</p>\n<p><em>Gregoire v. Biddle,</em> 177 F.2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949), <em>cert. denied,</em> 339 U.S. 949 (1950). [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p>In short, the rationale of our prior absolute immunity cases governs the disposition of this case.  In 1871, common law immunity for witnesses was well settled.  The principles set forth in <em>Pierson v. Ray</em> to protect judges and in <em>Imbler v. Pachtman</em> to protect prosecutors also apply to witnesses, who perform a somewhat different function in the trial process, but whose participation in bringing the litigation to a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="346">Page 460 U. S. 346</a></p><p> just -- or possibly unjust -- conclusion is equally indispensable.</p>\n<p>The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court has held that the prosecutor\'s knowing use of perjured testimony violates due process, but has not held that the false testimony of a police officer, in itself, violates constitutional rights.  <em>See United States v. Agurs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/97/case.html">427 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/97/case.html#103">427 U.

The opinion did not question the veracity of LaHue\'s testimony, but found that the State\'s evidence, including testimony that Briscoe was one of 50 to 100 persons who might have robbed the trailer, did not meet the State\'s burden of proof.  <em>Briscoe v. State,</em> 180 Ind.App. 450, 460, 388 N.E.2d 638, 644 (1979).  Petitioners Vickers and Ballard were still serving their sentences when the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of their complaint.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>On review of pretrial orders dismissing petitioners\' complaints, the Court of Appeals assumed that the complaints\' factual allegations of perjury were true.  It also assumed that petitioners had alleged a constitutional violation -- that they had been deprived of their liberty without due process of law by respondents\' perjury in the judicial proceedings that resulted in their convictions.  Because we granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals\' holding, we make the same assumptions for purposes of deciding this case, without implying that they are valid.  In light of its resolution of the immunity question the Court of Appeals did not determine whether the respondents had acted "under color of law," though it suggested that it might have answered in the affirmative.  663 F.2d at 721, n. 4.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>A rule of absolute witness immunity has been adopted by the majority of Courts of Appeals.  <em>Brawer v.

The petition does not raise the question of immunity for testimony at pretrial proceedings such as probable cause hearings, nor does petitioners\' brief discuss whether the same immunity considerations that apply to trial testimony also apply to testimony at probable cause hearings.  We therefore do not decide whether respondent LaHue is entitled to absolute immunity for allegedly false testimony at two probable cause hearings regarding petitioner Briscoe.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, even though the defective performance of defense counsel may cause the trial process to deprive an accused person of his liberty in an unconstitutional manner, <em>Cuyler v.

Other courts appear to have taken a position closer to the English rule, which did not require any showing of pertinency or materiality.  <em>See, e.g., Chambliss v.

Carroll,</em> 42 N.Y. 161, 166 (1870); <em>Shadden v. McElwee, supra,</em> at 149-150, 5 S.W. at 603, good faith was established as a matter of law if the statements were pertinent and material to the judicial proceeding and given in response to questions.  Indeed, even if the testimony was not pertinent, the plaintiff had the burden of proving bad faith.  The testimony by respondents in this case would have received absolute protection at common law, because it was directly relevant to the criminal charges against petitioners.  If the testimony had not been relevant, it is unlikely that petitioners would have stated a claim that their constitutional rights had been violated.  Therefore, for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983 analysis, there is no material difference between the English rule and the American rule.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL\'s dissent relies heavily on an opinion rendered by this Court, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html">White v.

The Court\'s discussion of privileged statements in judicial proceedings was purely dictum.  The plaintiff sought damages for defendants\' allegedly defamatory assertions in a petition to the President of the United States requesting the plaintiff\'s removal from office as a customs collector, a statement entitled, at most, to a qualified privilege.  <em>White v. Nicholls</em> cannot be considered authoritative.  In 1909, a leading commentator stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he demands of public policy on which the rule [of absolute immunity] is based are so controlling that there is only one considered case in the English or American reports in which the existence of the general doctrine of absolute immunity under the common law has ever been questioned.  Strangely enough, this isolated instance was a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the course of which Mr. Justice Daniel, speaking for the court, denied both the rule and its policy; but this expression of opinion was <em>obiter,</em> since the case in issue was one of qualified immunity."</p>\n<p>Veeder, Absolute Immunity in Defamation:  Judicial Proceedings, 9 Colum.L.Rev. 463, 465-466 (footnotes omitted).

And the review of the American authorities will show that the overwhelming weight of authority is opposed to Justice Daniel\'s idea, that there is no case in which an action of slander or libel will not lie for libelous matter spoken or written in the course of regular judicial proceedings. . . .  The authorities, both English and American, fully establish the position that there is a class of absolutely privileged communications. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Johnson v.

It makes clear that judges and other "state officials integral to the judicial process" are subject to <em>criminal</em> liability for violating the constitutional rights of individuals.  But we have never questioned that proposition, and we do not do so now.  Moreover, witnesses enjoyed no common law immunity from criminal prosecution for perjury.  <em>See</em> n.  <a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a> <em>supra.</em>  Therefore, the <em>criminal</em> provisions of the 1866 Act and its successors apply to official witnesses.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F32" name="T32">n</a> 32, <em>infra.</em>  But the 1866 legislative history, to the extent that it sheds any light on the meaning of the 1871 Act, does not support <em>civil</em> liability for such witnesses, because it does not show the requisite congressional intent to override the clearly established common law immunity of witnesses from civil liability.  With respect to witnesses, the legislative history of the 1866 Act is simply silent, and we are unwilling to assume that, whenever legislators referred to "state judicial officials" or to "the judicial power of the State," they were describing witnesses as well as judges, sheriffs, and marshals.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our decisions recognizing absolute immunity for judges and prosecutors from civil liability under the 1871 Act implicitly reject the position that the legislative history of the 1866 Act defines the scope of immunity for purposes of the 1871 Act.  <em>See Pierson v.

The plaintiff\'s complaint puts in issue the falsity and materiality of the allegedly perjured statements, and the defendant witness\' knowledge and state of mind at the time he testified.  Sometimes collateral estoppel principles will permit dismissal at the pretrial stage.  But if the truth of the allegedly perjured statement was not necessarily decided in the previous criminal verdict, if there is newly discovered evidence of falsity, or if the defendant concedes that the testimony was inaccurate, the central issue will be the defendant\'s state of mind.  Summary judgment is usually not feasible under these circumstances.  C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 493 (3d ed.1976).  If summary judgment is denied, the case must proceed to trial, and must traverse much of the same ground as the original criminal trial.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>We are not writing on a clean slate, and it is not for us to craft a new rule designed to enable trial judges to dismiss meritless claims before trial, but to allow recovery in cases of demonstrated injustice, when an innocent plaintiff has already obtained postconviction relief.

S. 347</a></span>.  Whatever the correctness of his historical argument, I fear that the Court has already crossed that bridge in <em>Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967), and <em>Imbler v.

S. 409</a></span> (1976).</p>\n<p>I entirely agree with JUSTICE MARSHALL, however, that the policies of \xc2\xa7 1983 and of common law witness immunity, as they apply to witnesses who are police officers, do not justify any absolute immunity for perjurious testimony.  I therefore dissent for the reasons stated in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#364">460 U. S. </a></span></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, except as to Part I, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree that police officers are absolutely immune from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V) for testimony given in criminal proceedings.  The extension of absolute immunity conflicts fundamentally with the language and purpose of the statute.  I would therefore be reluctant in any case to conclude that \xc2\xa7 1983 incorporates common law tort immunities that may have existed when Congress enacted the statute in 1871.  But in this case, the conclusion is especially unjustified.  First, absolute immunity for witnesses was by no means a settled legal proposition in 1871.  Most notably, in 1845, this Court had cast serious doubt on the existence of absolute immunity for testimony given in judicial proceedings.  Second, the origins and history of \xc2\xa7 1983 strongly suggest that Congress meant to abrogate any absolute immunity for government officials involved </p><p><a class="page-number" name="347">Page 460 U. S. 347</a></p><p> in the judicial process, including police officers.  Finally, considerations of public policy deemed necessary to justify absolute immunity in our past cases do not support an absolute immunity for officer-witnesses.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority opinion correctly states that this case presents a question of statutory construction.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#326">460 U. S. 326</a></span>.  Yet it departs from generally accepted principles for interpreting laws.</p>\n<p>In all other matters of statutory construction, this Court begins by focusing on the language of the statute itself. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  "Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."  <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/case.html">447 U. S. 102</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/102/case.html#108">447 U. S. 108</a></span> (1980).  The language of \xc2\xa7 1983 provides unambiguous guidance in this case.  A witness is most assuredly a "person," the word Congress employed to describe those whose conduct \xc2\xa7 1983 encompasses. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The majority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="348">Page 460 U. S. 348</a></p><p> turns the conventional approach to statutory interpretation on its head.  It assumes that common law tort immunities provide an exemption from the plain language of the statute unless petitioners demonstrate that Congress meant to override the immunity.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#336">460 U. S. 336</a></span>.  Thus, in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the Court simply presumes that Congress did not mean what it said.</p>\n<p>Absolute immunity for witnesses conflicts not only with the language of \xc2\xa7 1983, but also with its purpose.  In enacting \xc2\xa7 1983, Congress sought to create a damages action for victims of violations of federal rights; absolute immunity nullifies "<em>pro tanto</em> the very remedy it appears Congress sought to create."  <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html">424 U. S. 409</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#434">424 U. S. 434</a></span> (1976) (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).  The words of a statute should always be interpreted to carry out its purpose. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Moreover, Members of the 42d Congress explicitly stated that \xc2\xa7 1983 should be read so as to further its broad remedial goals.  As the sponsor of the 1871 Act, Representative Shellabarger, declared:</p>\n<p>"This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights.  All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed.  It would be most strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the rule of interpretation.  As has been again and again decided by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and everywhere else where there is wise judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 460 U. S. 349</a></p><p> interpretation, the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is uniformly given in construing such statutes and constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871). [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>It might be appropriate to import common law defenses and immunities into the statute if, in enacting \xc2\xa7 1983, Congress had merely sought to federalize state tort law.  But Congress "intended to give a broad remedy for violations of <em>federally</em> protected civil rights."  <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html">436 U. S. 658</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#685">436 U. S. 685</a></span> (1978) (emphasis added).  Different considerations surely apply when a suit is based on a federally guaranteed right -- in this case, the constitutional right to due process of law -- rather than the common law. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  The Congress that enacted \xc2\xa7 1983 had concluded that</p>\n<p>"a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from, and more serious than, a violation of a state right, and therefore deserves a different remedy, even though </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 460 U. S. 350</a></p><p> the same act may constitute both a state tort and the deprivation of a constitutional right."</p>\n<p><em>Monroe v. Pape,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html">365 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/365/167/case.html#196">365 U. S. 196</a></span> (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring).  Therefore, immunities that arose in the context of tort actions against private parties provide little guidance for actions against state officials for constitutional violations.</p>\n<p>"It would indeed be the purest coincidence if the state remedies for violations of common law rights by private citizens were fully appropriate to redress those injuries which only a state official can cause and against which the Constitution provides protection."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 196, n. 5.</p>\n<p>Given the language and purpose of \xc2\xa7 1983, I have serious doubts about any further extension of absolute immunity to state officials in actions under \xc2\xa7 1983.  At a minimum, I do not believe the Court should extend absolute immunity to state officials "in the absence of the most convincing showing that the immunity is necessary."  <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#434">424 U. S. 434</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).  For the reasons elaborated below, I believe that the case for absolute witness immunity is far from convincing.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority\'s decision is predicated on its conclusion that "[i]n 1871, common law immunity for witnesses was well settled."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#345">460 U. S. 345</a></span>.  I disagree with this view of the law as it stood when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1983.</p>\n<p>To begin with, some of petitioners\' allegations would clearly not have been barred by doctrines of immunity at common law.  The majority discusses only the immunities associated with actions for defamation at common law.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#330">460 U. S. 330</a></span>-331, n. 9.  However, petitioner Briscoe did not allege solely that Officer LaHue had testified falsely at his trial, a claim resembling one for defamation.  He also alleged that Officer LaHue had made knowingly false charges at two probable cause hearings, one of which resulted in Briscoe\'s arrest. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  At common law, such an allegation would have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 460 U. S. 351</a></p><p> formed the basis of an action on the case for malicious prosecution, [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] or the related action known by its Latin name, <em>crimen feloniae imposuit</em> (imputing the crime of felony). [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  Both English and American courts routinely permitted plaintiffs to bring actions alleging that the defendant had made a false and malicious accusation of a felony to a magistrate or other judicial officer. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  No immunity barred these suits.  Indeed, an absolute immunity would have been illogical, for it would have allowed a defendant to avoid the related common law action for false imprisonment by the simple expedient of proffering false charges before a magistrate, and thereby securing an arrest warrant. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="352">Page 460 U. S. 352</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Even with respect to the common law action for defamation which the majority discusses, I cannot agree that an absolute immunity for witnesses was well-settled law in 1871.  In 1845, this Court had rejected both the rule of absolute immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 460 U. S. 353</a></p><p> and its logical underpinnings, proposing instead that a plaintiff allege and prove malice in the case of privileged communications.</p>\n<p>In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html">White v. Nicholls,</a></span></em> 3 How. 266 (1845), Justice Daniel wrote for a unanimous Court in dicta a veritable treatise on the law of defamation and privileged communications. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  The Court began by noting the existence of various exceptions</p>\n<p>"which, in the elementary treatises, and in the decisions upon libel and slander, have been denominated privileged communications or publications."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html#286">44 U.

The Court then stated:</p>\n<p>"But the term \'exceptions,\' as applied to cases like those just enumerated, could <em>never</em> be interpreted to mean that there is a class of actors or transactions placed above the cognisance of the law, absolved from the commands of justice.  It is difficult to conceive how, in society where rights and duties are relative and mutual, there can be tolerated those who are privileged to do injury <em>legibus soluti,</em> and still more difficult to imagine how such a privilege could be instituted or tolerated upon the principles of social good.  The privilege spoken of in the books should, in our opinion, be taken with strong and well-defined qualifications.  It properly signifies this, and nothing more.  That the excepted instances shall so far change the ordinary rule with respect to slanderous or libelous matter as to remove the regular and usual presumption of malice, and to make it incumbent on the party complaining to show malice, either by the construction of the spoken or written matter, or by the facts and circumstances connected with that matter, or with the situation of the parties, adequate to authorize the conclusion."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 460 U.

S. 337</a></span>.  In fact, there is considerable evidence in the legislative history that Congress did intend to abrogate the immunity of participants in state judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>At petitioners\' urging, [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] the Court has extensively examined the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, 17 Stat. 13, now codified as 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1985(3) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  However, the forerunner of \xc2\xa7 1983 was \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act, not \xc2\xa7 2.  As the majority points out, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#337">460 U. S. 337</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#340">460 U. S. 340</a></span>-341, the two sections differ significantly in their language and purpose.  It is thus hardly surprising that the debates over \xc2\xa7 2 shed little light on \xc2\xa7 1.  In my view, the inquiry should focus on the history of \xc2\xa7 1.  Only by examining the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 460 U. S. 357</a></p><p> genesis of that provision can it be determined whether Congress intended to abrogate certain common law immunities.</p>\n<p>The origin of \xc2\xa7 1 is not open to serious question.  The language and concept of the provision were derived in large part from \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  The author of \xc2\xa7 1 clearly stated the relationship between the two Acts in introducing the 1871 measure:</p>\n<p>"My first inquiry is as to the warrant which we have for enacting such a section as this [\xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act].  The model for it will be found in the second section of the act of April 9, 1866, known as the \'civil rights act.\'  <em>That section provides a criminal proceeding in identically the same case as this one provides a civil remedy for,</em> except that the deprivation under color of State law must, under the civil rights act, have been on account of race, color, or former slavery.  This section of the bill, <em>on the same state of facts,</em> not only provides a civil remedy for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 460 U. S. 358</a></p><p> persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Because the two provisions are so intimately connected, a full examination of the history of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act must begin with \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was the first federal statute to provide broad protection in the field of civil rights.  Its primary purpose was to guarantee the newly emancipated Negro equality with whites before the law.  Section 2 of the Act provided criminal liability for any person who, acting under color of law, deprived another of his rights because of race.  This provision was extensively debated.  Controversy centered in large part over its intended application to state officials integral to the judicial process.</p>\n<p>The liability of state judicial officials and all official participants in state judicial proceedings under \xc2\xa7 2 was explicitly and repeatedly affirmed. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  The notion of immunity for such officials was thoroughly discredited.  The Senate sponsor of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 460 U. S. 359</a></p><p> the Act deemed the idea</p>\n<p>"akin to the maxim of the English law that the King can do no wrong.  It places officials above the law.  It is the very doctrine out of which the rebellion [the Civil War] was hatched."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1758 (1866) (Sen. Trumbull).  Thus, \xc2\xa7 2 was "aimed directly at the State judiciary."  <em>Id.</em> at 1155 (Rep. Eldridge).  <em>See also id.</em> at 1778 (Sen. Johnson, member of the Senate Judiciary Committee) (\xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act "strikes at the judicial department of the governments of the States").</p>\n<p>Two unsuccessful efforts were made to amend \xc2\xa7 2.  First, Representative Miller introduced an amendment to exempt state judges from criminal liability.  <em>Id.</em> at 1156.  Second, and of particular significance, Representative Bingham introduced an amendment to substitute a civil action for the criminal sanctions contained in the proposal.  <em>Id.</em> at 1266, 1271-1272.  The sponsor of the 1866 Act, Representative Wilson, opposed the amendment largely on the ground that it would place the financial burden of protecting civil rights on poor individuals, instead of on the government.  <em>Id.</em> at 1295.  At the same time, he stressed that there was "no difference in the principle involved" between a civil remedy and a criminal sanction.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>After the 1866 bill passed the Senate and House, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it.  His opposition was based in part on the fact that \xc2\xa7 2 of the bill "invades the judicial power of the State."  Veto Message, in <em>id.</em> at 1680.  The President warned that</p>\n<p>"judges of the State courts . . . [and] marshals and sheriffs, who should, as ministerial officers, execute processes, sanctioned by State laws and issued by State judges, in execution of their judgments, could be brought before other tribunals and there subjected to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties which such state laws might impose."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Within two weeks, both the Senate and the House overrode the veto.  Various Congressmen responded to the President\'s criticisms, and freely admitted that \xc2\xa7 2 of the legislation was aimed at state judicial systems.  As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 460 U. S. 360</a></p><p> Lawrence, declared:</p>\n<p>"I answer it is better to invade the judicial power of the State than permit it to invade, strike down, and destroy the civil rights of citizens.  A judicial power perverted to such uses should be speedily invaded.  The grievance would be insignificant."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1837.  <em>See also id.</em> at 1758 (response of Sen. Trumbull to President\'s veto message); <em>id.</em> at 1838 (statement of Rep. Clarke).  The bill became law on April 9, 1866.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>This Court has, from time to time, read \xc2\xa7 1983 against the "background" of common law tort liability. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  Far more pertinent to this case, however, is the background provided by the 1866 Civil Rights Act.  Representative Bingham, who had introduced the amendment to substitute civil liability for criminal liability in the 1866 Act, had become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee by the time of the 42d Congress.  Senator Trumbull, the Senate sponsor of the 1866 Act, was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1871.  Representative Shellabarger, who had participated in the debates on the 1866 legislation, [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] drafted the 1871 Act.</p>\n<p>Congress was well aware that the "model" for \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 law could be found in the 1866 Civil Rights Act.  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871) (Rep. Shellabarger).  The manager of the bill in the Senate, George Edmunds, stressed that \xc2\xa7 1 was merely "carrying out the principles of the civil rights bill" that had been passed in 1866.  <em>Id.</em> at 568.  Representative Coburn stated that \xc2\xa7 1 "gives a civil remedy parallel to the penal provision" in the Civil Rights Act.  "If this penal section is valid, and no one dares controvert it, the civil remedy is legal and unquestionable."  <em>Id.</em> at 461.  <em>See also id.</em> at 429 (Rep. McHenry in opposition) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 460 U. S. 361</a></p><p> ("The first section of the bill is intended as an amendment of the civil rights act"); <em>id.</em> at 365 (Rep. Arthur in opposition) (\xc2\xa7 1 is "cumulative, as far as it goes, with certain provisions in the civil rights bill").</p>\n<p>The fact that \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act was the model for \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act explains why the debates in the 42d Congress on \xc2\xa7 1 were so perfunctory. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Of all the measures in the Ku Klux Klan Act, \xc2\xa7 1 generated the least controversy, since it merely provided a civil counterpart to the far more controversial criminal provision in the 1866 Act.  <em>See id.</em> at 568 (Sen. Edmunds) ("The first section is one that I believe nobody objects to"); <em>id.</em> at App. 313 (Rep. Burchard) ("To the first section, giving an injured party redress by suit at law in the United States courts in the cases enumerated, I can see no objections"); <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,</em> 436 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/658/case.html#665">436 U. S. 665</a></span> (debate on \xc2\xa7 1 was limited, and the section passed without amendment); Developments in the Law -- Section 1983 and Federalism, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 1133, 1155 (1977).</p>\n<p>Opponents of \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act repeated the same arguments that had been made against \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act.  They warned of the liability for judicial officers that would result from enactment of \xc2\xa7 1. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Indeed, in portraying the inevitable consequences of the 1871 Act, Senator Thurman pointed to criminal prosecutions of state judicial officers that had already taken place under the 1866 Act.  These statements can hardly be dismissed as exaggerated rhetoric from opponents of the 1871 Act. [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>]  Instead, they simply reflect the fact that the battle over liability for those integral to the judicial process had already been fought in 1866 when Congress </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 460 U. S. 362</a></p><p> adopted the far more serious criminal sanction aimed at state judicial systems.  Section 1, in contrast, provided for "the mild remedy of a civil action."  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 482 (1871) (Rep. Wilson, member of the House Judiciary Committee).  So it was not surprising that the arguments of the opponents to the 1871 Act would fall on deaf ears.  It is also noteworthy that Representative Shellabarger, who was hardly reluctant to interrupt speakers who were misconstruing his proposal, [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>] never disputed the opponents\' characterizations with regard to the liability of state judicial officers. [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>]</p>\n<p>To assume that Congress, which had enacted a criminal sanction directed against state judicial officials, [<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>] intended <em>sub silentio</em> to exempt those same officials from the civil counterpart approaches the incredible. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  Sheriffs and marshals, while performing a quintessentially judicial function such as serving process, were clearly liable under the 1866 Act, notwithstanding President Johnson\'s objections.  Because, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 460 U. S. 363</a></p><p> as Representative Shellabarger stated, \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act provided a civil remedy "in identically the same case" or "on the same state of facts" as \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act, it obviously overrode whatever immunity may have existed at common law for these participants in the judicial process in 1871.</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>The lack of historical support for witness immunity sharply contrasts with the substantial historical support for legislative immunity which this Court recognized in <em>Tenney v. Brandhove,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html">341 U. S. 367</a></span> (1951), a case on which the majority relies.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#330">460 U. S. 330</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#334">460 U. S. 334</a></span>.  Legislative immunity enjoyed a unique historical position, since it had been conceived in the Parliamentary struggles of the 17th century and enshrined in the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution.  The vast majority of States had adopted constitutional provisions providing a parallel protection against civil and criminal liability.  <em>See</em> 341 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#372">341 U. S. 372</a></span>-375.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the history of \xc2\xa7 1 supports incorporation of legislative immunity.  For example, when the specter of holding state legislators liable under \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1866 Act was raised by President Johnson\'s veto message, [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>] the Senate sponsor of the Act was quick to disavow any such intention.  Senator Trumbull argued at some length that legislators did not fall within the scope of the Act, because they "enact" laws, rather than act "under color of" state law. [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>]  Whatever the validity of this distinction, it no doubt reflected the reluctance of Congress to impinge on the immunity of state legislators.  But while the Radical Republican Congress was a "staunch advocate of legislative freedom," 341 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#376">341 U. S. 376</a></span>, it displayed no solicitude for state courts. [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>]  The debates over the 1871 Act are replete with hostile comments directed at state judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 460 U. S. 364</a></p><p> systems. [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]  It is entirely reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to make state legislators immune from civil liability under \xc2\xa7 1 of the 1871 Act.  No similar evidence exists to support an immunity for police officers testifying as witnesses. [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority also bases its decision on considerations of public policy, which purportedly mandate absolute immunity for police officers sued under \xc2\xa7 1983 for their testimony as witnesses.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#341">460 U. S. 341</a></span>-345.  This Court has recognized absolute immunity only in "exceptional situations" where public policy makes it "essential."  <em>Butz v. Economou,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html">438 U. S. 478</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html#507">438 U. S. 507</a></span> (1978). [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>]  In my view, the case for official witness immunity falls far short of this standard. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 460 U. S. 365</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Police officers and other government officials differ significantly from private citizens, around whom common law doctrines of witness immunity developed.  A police officer comes to the witness stand clothed with the authority of the State.  His official status gives him credibility, and creates a far greater potential for harm than exists when the average citizen testifies. [<a href="#F2/34" name="T2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>]  The situation is aggravated when the official draws on special expertise.  A policeman testifying about a fingerprint identification or a medical examiner testifying as to the cause of a death can have a critical impact on a defendant\'s trial. [<a href="#F2/35" name="T2/35">Footnote 2/35</a>]  At the same time, the threat of a criminal perjury prosecution, which serves as an important constraint on the average witness\' testimony, is virtually nonexistent in the police witness context.  Despite the apparent prevalence of police perjury, [<a href="#F2/36" name="T2/36">Footnote 2/36</a>] prosecutors exhibit extreme </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 460 U. S. 366</a></p><p> reluctance in charging police officials with criminal conduct because of their need to maintain close working relationships with law enforcement agencies. [<a href="#F2/37" name="T2/37">Footnote 2/37</a>]  The majority thus forecloses a civil sanction in precisely those situations where the need is most pressing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the danger that official witnesses would be inhibited in testifying by the fear of a damages action is much more remote than would be the case with private witnesses.  Policemen normally have a duty to testify about matters involving their official conduct.  The notion that officials with a professional interest in securing criminal convictions would shade their testimony in favor of a defendant to avoid the risk of a civil suit can only be viewed with skepticism.  In addition, police officials are usually insulated from any economic hardship associated with lawsuits based on conduct within the scope of their authority. [<a href="#F2/38" name="T2/38">Footnote 2/38</a>]  In any event, if the Court truly desires to give police officers "<em>every encouragement to make a full disclosure of all pertinent information within their knowledge,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#335">460 U. S. 335</a></span> (quoting <em>Imbler v. Pachtman,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/case.html#439">424 U. S. 439</a></span> (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment)), then, at the very least, it should permit \xc2\xa7 1983 suits which allege that officials withheld key information while testifying. [<a href="#F2/39" name="T2/39">Footnote 2/39</a>] </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 460 U. S. 367</a></em></p><p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p>The majority\'s primary concern appears to be that \xc2\xa7 1983 suits against police witnesses would impose "significant burdens on the judicial system and on law enforcement resources."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#343">460 U. S. 343</a></span>.  As an empirical matter, this contention is unfounded.  Both the Sixth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit have permitted such suits for over five years, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#328">460 U. S. 328</a></span>-329, n. 4, but there is no perceptible drain on legal resources in those Circuits compared to other Circuits that bar such lawsuits.  Moreover, a comprehensive study of \xc2\xa7 1983 suits filed in the Central District of California, which includes Los Angeles, indicates that only about 30 actions for false arrest were filed annually in that District. [<a href="#F2/40" name="T2/40">Footnote 2/40</a>]  Police officers arrest much more frequently than they testify, and an arrest will undoubtedly make many individuals disgruntled.  Yet lawsuits based on such allegations constituted only 0.5% of all cases filed in the Central District, [<a href="#F2/41" name="T2/41">Footnote 2/41</a>] or an average of only one for every 243 full-time police </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 460 U. S. 368</a></p><p> officers in the city of Los Angeles. [<a href="#F2/42" name="T2/42">Footnote 2/42</a>]  This does not appear to be a "significant burden." [<a href="#F2/43" name="T2/43">Footnote 2/43</a>]  The simple fact is that practical obstacles alone are enough to deter most individuals from suing the police for official misconduct. [<a href="#F2/44" name="T2/44">Footnote 2/44</a>]</p>\n<p>In considering the competing interests at stake in this area, the majority strikes a very one-sided balance.  It eschews any qualified immunity in favor of an absolute one.  Thus, the mere inquiry into good faith is deemed so undesirable that we must simply acquiesce in the possibility that government officials will maliciously deprive citizens of their rights. [<a href="#F2/45" name="T2/45">Footnote 2/45</a>]  For my part, I cannot conceive in this case how patent violations of individual rights can be tolerated in the name of the public good.</p>\n<p>"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protections of the laws, whenever he receives an injury."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v.

The majority emphasizes that the question presented in the petition for certiorari only mentions testimony by a police officer during a criminal trial.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#329">460 U.

The petition for certiorari in this case specifically referred to Officer LaHue\'s testimony at "several judicial proceedings relating to the state criminal prosecution," Pet. for Cert. 7, and it spoke in general terms about absolute witness immunity, <em>e.g., id.</em> at 14, 16-18, 20.  Both petitioners and respondents obviously thought the issue was before us since they quoted lengthy excerpts from Officer LaHue\'s testimony at the probable cause hearings in their briefs before this Court.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioners 3-5; Brief for Respondents 2-4.  Petitioner Briscoe has asserted respondent LaHue\'s liability for testimony at the probable cause hearing throughout this proceeding.  <em>E.g.,</em>App. 9-11, 17-22.  Indeed, the District Court appeared to believe that the <em>only</em> issue raised by Briscoe\'s complaint involved testimony at a probable cause hearing.  <em>See Briscoe v. LaHue,</em> No. S 78-139 (ND Ind., Oct. 3, 1978), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-47.  The Court of Appeals discussed the probable cause hearing testimony, 663 F.2d 713, 715, and its holding was framed in general terms regarding testimony at judicial proceedings, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#328">460 U. S. 328</a></span>, which would certainly include probable cause hearings.</p>\n<p>The majority nonetheless clearly leaves open the issue of immunity for testimony at a probable cause hearing.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#329">460 U. S. 329</a></span>, n. 5.  The absence of any immunity in such cases at common law should alone undermine any claim to absolute immunity under \xc2\xa7 1983.  In addition, the policy considerations applicable to testimony at a probable cause hearing differ substantially from those relevant to testimony at a trial. For instance, the absence of cross-examination at probable cause hearings increases the risk that false testimony will go undetected.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court itself noted that its examination of the law was "extended" because of the "importance of [the] subject."  3 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/266/case.html#291">44 U.

That is precisely the point:  federal common law diverged from state common law as to witness immunity.  The majority reasons as if state common law controlled the matter.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#331">460 U. S. 331</a></span>-333, and nn. 11, 12.  Because federal common law prevailed when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1983, and because the federal remedy provided in the Act was accompanied by a new grant of federal jurisdiction, I believe <em>White v. Nicholl</em> would have been the natural focus of attention for the 42d Congress.  The majority does not explain why it thinks that the 42d Congress would instead have focused on state common law.</p>\n<p>In any event, the majority\'s analysis of state court decisions is sorely deficient.  The proper inquiry in this case, as defined by the majority itself, is on common law principles as understood by the Members of the 42d Congress.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#330">460 U. S. 330</a></span>.  The 42d Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1983 in 1871.  Yet the majority inexplicably relies on 11 cases decided <em>after</em> 1871.  These cases are plainly irrelevant to the question of the 42d Congress\' intent.  Unless it was clairvoyant, the 42d Congress could not possibly have had access to most of the decisions relied on by the majority.  By the same token, Congress certainly would not have had the benefit of the views of Van Vechter Veeder, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#332">460 U. S. 332</a></span>, n. 12, who wrote his article in 1909.</p>\n<p>The only arguably relevant support that the majority cites for the view that Congress extended absolute immunity to police officers who give perjurious testimony consists of eight state court cases decided before 1871.  None of these cases involved testimony by an official of the State, let alone a police officer, and the only support the majority can muster for the notion that the common law witness immunity drew no distinction between public officials and private citizens is the 1909 article by Van Vechter Veeder.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#336">460 U. S. 336</a></span>, n. 15.  In three of the pre-1871 cases, plaintiffs suing for defamation prevailed completely.  In <em>Smith v. Howard,</em> 28 Iowa 51 (1869), and <em>White v. Carroll,</em> 42 N.Y. 161 (1870), the State Supreme Courts <em>affirmed</em> an award of damages recovered against a defendant who had slandered the plaintiff from the witness stand.  Similarly, in <em>Perkin v. Mitchell,</em> 31 Barb. 461 (N.Y. 1860), the state court affirmed a trial court order rejecting a defendant\'s demurrer to a complaint.  It held that a plaintiff <em>could</em> sue for defamatory statements made by a physician to a Justice of the Peace that resulted in the plaintiff\'s commitment as a lunatic.  Whatever might have been said about immunity in these cases was, to use the majority\'s language, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/325/case.html#332">460 U. S. 332</a></span>, n. 12, "purely dictum."  Two other cases, <em>Hoar v. Wood,</em> 44 Mass.193 (1841), and <em>Shelfer v. Gooding,</em> 47 N.C. 175 (1855), involved statements by counsel, and not statements by a witness.  This leaves three pre-1871 state cases upholding witness immunity, and these only as to private witnesses.</p>\n<p>As between a smattering of state court opinions and the extended and well-reasoned analysis of a unanimous Supreme Court, I think the latter would have commanded the attention of the Members of the 42d Congress.  In fact, while Members of the 42d Congress displayed little interest in or familiarity with state court decisions, they often focused on cases from the United States Supreme Court in their deliberations on the 1871 Act.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 375 (1871) (Cong.Globe) (Rep.

In my view, we should be even more reluctant to import absolute immunities into \xc2\xa7 1983 suits than into <em>Bivens</em> actions.  First, with \xc2\xa7 1983, we deal with explicit statutory language indicating the broad scope of the action, whereas <em>Bivens</em> actions have been implied by the federal courts.  Second, the need to restrain state action implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment is implicated by \xc2\xa7 1983 suits, while that Amendment has no relevance to suits against federal officials.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/34" name="F2/34">Footnote 2/34</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Nugent v.

Here, as the lower court noted, 663 F.2d 713, 719, a witness normally exercises no discretion in the performance of his duty to answer fully and truthfully all questions put to him.
