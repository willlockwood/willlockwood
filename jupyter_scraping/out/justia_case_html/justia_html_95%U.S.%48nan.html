A general power conferred upon the agent of a railroad company to borrow money on its behalf in such sums, for such length of time, and at such a rate of interest as he may think proper and to purchase iron rails, locomotives, machinery, &amp;c., on such terms as he may deem advisable, and, in order so to do, to make, execute, and deliver obligations, bills of exchange, contracts, and agreements of the company, includes authority to give to the lender of the money borrowed, or to the seller of the things purchased, the ordinary securities.</p>\n<p>2. Persons who deal with an agent before notice of the recall of his powers are not affected by the recall.</p>\n<p>3. Upon consideration of the written evidence in this case, the Court holds l. that the contract entered into April 21, 1859, between the defendant and the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company by Edmund Rice, its president, was authorized by the resolution of the board of directors of that company, passed July 13, 1858; 2. that the resolution of said board passed May 13, 1859, was an acknowledgment that the contract was a binding obligation upon the company.</p>\n<p>This action was trover by Edwin A. C. Hatch against Thomas B. Coddington for the conversion of forty-five Minnesota State bonds.  Each party claimed them under the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company, to whom they had, on the 3d of February, 1859, been issued by the state under a provision of its constitution authorizing the issue of such bonds for the purpose of expediting the construction of certain railroads.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff claimed title by the following transfers, both dated May 13, 1859:</p>\n<p>"For value received, we, the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Company, hereby sell, assign, transfer, and set over to Selah Chamberlain and his assigns forty-five bonds for $1,000 each, issued by the State of Minnesota to us, and now in the hands of Thomas B.

NEWTON, <em>Secretary</em>"</p>\n<p>There was no evidence that these resolutions were ever brought home to the defendant.  The evidence as to the absolute delivery of the contract was conflicting, and took a wide range.  The contract provided for a purchase and sale of railroad iron, and an advance by T. B. Coddington &amp; Co. of $16,000 to the company, on its notes.  The company was to deposit as security eighty-five bonds; but it had in New York, at the time the contract was executed, only the forty-five in question.</p>\n<p>The contract was made in duplicate, and signed at New York on the part of the company by Rice, the president.  At the same time were signed three notes for the $16,000.  Rice received one of the contracts, and a letter of credit authorizing drafts for the $16,000; the other contract and the notes were delivered to T. B. Coddington &amp; Co.  The bonds were delivered with the following letter:</p>\n<p>"NEW YORK, 21st April, 1859"</p>\n<p>"Messrs. T. B.

He testified that the papers were exchanged absolutely, he being represented by his clerk; and Newton testified that there was no condition of any kind in reference to the delivery.</p>\n<p>The contract, the three notes, the letter of credit, and the letter undertaking to send forty more bonds were all executed April 21, 1859.  Rice and Newton at once telegraphed to Nelson, at St. Paul, "Interest on state bonds provided for, and a thousand tons of iron purchased," and started for that place the next day, where they arrived on or before the 29th of April.  On that day and the next, and on the 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th of May, they attended meetings of the board.</p>\n<p>On the 30th of April Rice wrote to defendant the following letter, which was the first communication he sent after leaving New York for St. Paul:</p>\n<p>"OFFICE OF THE MINNESOTA &amp; PACIFIC R.

The court refused so to charge, but left the evidence of the conduct of the company and its officers to the jury, with the instruction, however, requested by the plaintiff, that</p>\n<p>"to constitute ratification there must have been a direct sanction of the contract by the board of directors, or conduct, or acts, or a resolution or resolutions inconsistent with any other supposition than an assent to such contract by said board."</p>\n<p>The court also left the evidence of the conduct of the company and its officers, after the date of the contract, to the jury, as bearing</p>\n<p>"upon the question whether either of the conditions . . . were impressed upon the contract, so as to make the delivery conditional and dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions . . . as having a proper bearing as evidence upon the fact whether the condition was imposed."</p>\n<p>To this instruction the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p>The court also charged the jury that, under the resolution of July 13, 1858, Rice had authority to make the contract of April 21, 1859, and that that authority was not withdrawn by the resolutions of Jan. 23 and Feb. 3, 1859, nor did those resolutions derogate, detract from, or in any manner impair the force and efficiency of said resolution of July 13, 1858.

JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We concur with the circuit court in the opinion that Mr. Rice was authorized by the resolution of the board of directors of July 13, 1858, to make the contract with the defendant, which it is claimed he made on the 21st of April, 1859.  That resolution was very broad.  As appears from its preamble, it aimed to provide, promptly, means for the construction of one hundred miles of the company\'s railroad, and to guard against default in the performance of the conditions upon which the credit of the state had been loaned; and these aims were intended to be secured, in part, with the aid of the state loan -- that is, with the aid of the state bonds delivered to the company.  The preamble, having avowed such purposes, was followed by a resolution which expressly conferred upon Mr. Rice, the president of the company, several distinct powers.  The first was to sell or hypothecate the first mortgage bonds of the company (thereafter to be issued) for such sum or sums as he might think for the interest of the company.  A second power given was to borrow money on behalf of the company in such sums, for such length of time, and at such a rate of interest as he might think proper.  And thirdly, he was empowered to purchase iron rails, locomotives, machinery, &amp;c., for the company, on such terms as he might deem advisable, and, to enable him to carry out these powers and authority, he was empowered to make, execute, and deliver obligations, bills of exchange, contracts, and agreements of the company.  It is difficult to see what words would have been more comprehensive for the grant of power to do everything which, in the judgment of Mr. Rice, was necessary or advisable, either for borrowing money or purchasing iron for the company.  A general power to borrow money includes authority to give to the lender the ordinary securities for the sum borrowed.  Among these are bonds, notes, or acceptances, and collaterals.  But the resolution went further.  It conferred power to make contracts and agreements, such as would enable Mr. Rice to borrow money or to make purchases of railroad iron; not merely contracts of purchase, but contracts and agreements that might enable him to effect a purchase.  An engagement to give collaterals as a security for money borrowed, or for the payment of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 95 U. S. 56</a></p><p> debt incurred for iron, is surely within the limits of such a power.  This disposes of the first question raised by the assignments of error.  We hold that there is nothing in the agreement of April 21, 1859, transgressive of the power with which the president of the company was clothed by the resolution of the directors.</p>\n<p>We are also of opinion that the power thus conferred was not revoked or withdrawn by the subsequent resolutions of Jan. 23 and Feb. 3, 1859.  They made no reference to the action of the board in 1858, or to any powers conferred by that action upon the president of the company.  Undoubtedly, they conferred authority upon Mr. Nelson, acting as president of the company in the absence of the president, to dispose of the bonds; but such authority was not inconsistent with the concurrent existence of the like power in Rice.  Two persons may be employed separately to negotiate the sale or hypothecation of bonds, and either may thus dispose of them.  If a disposition be made by one, of course the other will be unable to exercise the power with which he was clothed; but, until a sale or hypothecation is made, either may make it.  Moreover, in this case there is no evidence that knowledge of the resolutions of Jan. 23 and Feb. 3, 1859, was ever communicated or intended to be communicated to the defendant.  The authority given to Mr. Rice was exhibited to him. On its face it was a continuing authority, on which he had a right to rely until notified of its revocation.  Persons who deal with an agent before notice of the recall of his powers are not affected by the recall.  2 Kent Com. 644, note; <em>Fellows v. Steamboat Company,</em> 38 Conn. 197; <em>Tier v. Sampson,</em> 35 Vt. 179; <em>Morgan v. Stell,</em> 5 Binn. (Pa.) 305.  It follows, therefore, very plainly there was no error in the refusal of the circuit judge to instruct the jury that, if the resolution of July 13, 1858, conferred upon Mr. Rice authority to make the contract, the authority was withdrawn by the resolutions of Jan. 23 and Feb. 3, 1859.</p>\n<p>At the trial in the court below there was some evidence that the contract set up as a defense by the defendant was not unconditionally delivered.  The plaintiff alleged that when it left the hands of Mr. Rice, on its way to the defendant, after his signature, two conditions accompanied it.  One was that it should not be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 95 U. S. 57</a></p><p> binding, and that the delivery of the bonds should be inoperative, unless the board of directors of the company, after being advised thereof, should approve, ratify, and confirm it.  The other condition alleged was, that if forty of the bonds, making up, with the forty-five deposited with the defendant, the eighty-five called for by the contract, had been disposed of at St. Paul by the proper officer of the company who had them in charge, the contract should not be binding.  Whether such conditions had been imposed was a question of fact properly submitted to the jury, with the instruction that, if they had been, the contract was not binding unless the company afterwards ratified and adopted it.  It therefore became a material inquiry in one aspect of the case whether there had been such an adoption or ratification, and the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury that there had been no ratification by the railroad company, and especially that a certain resolution of the company, adopted May 13, 1859, and communicated to the defendant, was not a ratification.  The court declined to give such instructions, and, we think, properly.  We think the resolution referred to was a plain acknowledgment that the contract made by Mr. Rice with the defendant was binding upon the company, and, as it was communicated to the defendant, it was notice to him that the company acknowledged its obligation.  In the resolution and its preamble, there is nothing which denies that the contract to which it refers had been made or asserts that no obligation had been assumed.  On the contrary, all its language is appropriate to a contract perfected.  It is an admission that the company had confirmed and accepted it.  It speaks of the contract as made, not merely proposed, and asserts as impossibility to comply with its terms, not of an impossibility to enter into the engagement.  It authorizes Newton to procure a surrender of the contract and a return of the bonds, which it states had been transferred to Coddington &amp; Co. upon such terms as might be agreed upon.  All this is plain recognition of the contract as a binding obligation and an assertion of a wish to obtain a release from it.  To say the least, it is inconsistent with any intent to treat the contract as imperfect and inoperative.  In view of it, we think the court was justified in refusing to charge the jury as requested, and if there was error in the mode in which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 95 U. S. 58</a></p><p> the question of ratification was submitted, it was error of which the plaintiff cannot complain.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to notice the other assignment of error in view of what we have said.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
