See, e.g., Burns v. Reed, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478\n.  This interpretation of \xc2\xa71983 has been reaffirmed by the Court time and again.  Thus, the Court looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the immunities available in actions brought under \xc2\xa71983.  See Kalina v. Fletcher, \n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118\n.  Taking a \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional approach,\xe2\x80\x9d see, e.g., Forrester v. White, \n\n484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219\n, the Court identifies those governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98performed with independence and without fear of consequences,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Pierson v. Ray, \n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 547\n.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s functional approach is tied to the common law\xe2\x80\x99s identification of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity, but the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to protect those functions.  For example, it was common in 1871 for cases to be prosecuted by private parties, who did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit.  But as the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials, common-law courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert.  This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to private, prosecutors.  Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under \xc2\xa71983 reached this Court in Imbler v. Pachtman, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409\n, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead relied substantially on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for common-law torts.  Neither has the Court suggested that \xc2\xa71983 is simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims.  The new federal claim created by \xc2\xa71983 differs in important ways from pre-existing common-law torts.  Accordingly, both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in \xc2\xa71983 actions differ in some respects from the common law.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x959.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0A trial witness sued under \xc2\xa71983 enjoys absolute immunity from any claim based on his testimony.  Briscoe v. LaHue, \n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352\n.  Without absolute immunity, the truth-seeking process would be impaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify, and even a witness who took the stand \xe2\x80\x9cmight be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cfear of subsequent liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 333.  These factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.  In both contexts, a witness\xe2\x80\x99 fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.  And in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony because other sanctions, chiefly prosecution for perjury, provide a sufficient deterrent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons identified in Briscoe, supra, at 342\xe2\x80\x93344, there is no reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses in \xc2\xa71983 actions.  And the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any \xc2\xa71983 claim based on the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony, or by using evidence of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony to support any other \xc2\xa71983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution.  Were it otherwise, a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the preparatory activity\xe2\x80\x94such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony\xe2\x80\x94rather than the absolutely immune actions themselves.  Pp. 9\xe2\x88\x9212.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s main argument is that under Malley v. Briggs, \n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335\n\xe2\x88\x92341, and Kalina v. Fletcher, \n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118\n, grand jury witnesses who are \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d are not entitled to absolute immunity.  But at the time \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor was enacted, a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d was a party who procured an arrest and initiated a criminal prosecution.  A \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d might testify, either before a grand jury or at trial, but testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive function performed by a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness.\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testimony, see Briscoe, 460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 326, and there is no more reason why a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce the distinctive function performed by a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement officer who testifies before a grand jury is not comparable to a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d because it is not the officer who makes the critical decision to press criminal charges, but the prosecutor.  It would be anomalous to permit a police officer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for the decision to initiate a prosecution.  Petitioner also contends that the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury proceedings because trial witnesses face cross-examination.  But the force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allowing such civil actions would create\xe2\x80\x94subversion of grand jury secrecy, which is essential to the proper functioning of the grand jury system.  See United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 418\n.  And finally, contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction between States that use grand juries and States that permit felony prosecutions to be brought by complaint or information.  Most States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at which witnesses testify, and the lower courts have held that preliminary hearing witnesses are protected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses.

Petitioner challenged the suf- ficiency of this second indictment, claiming that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnowhere near Dr. Hotz\xe2\x80\x9d on the date in question and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here was no evidence whatsoever that [he] committed an assault on anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d  611 F.\xc2\xa03d 828, 836 (CA11 2010).

Respondent moved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that he was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury testimony.  The United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in accordance with Circuit precedent, that respondent was absolutely immune from a \xc2\xa71983 claim based on his grand jury testimony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals noted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that respondent was the sole \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d before the grand jury, but the Court of Appeals declined to recognize a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d exception to its precedent on grand jury witness immunity.

The court went on to hold that respondent was entitled to absolute immunity, not only with respect to claims based directly on his grand jury testimony, but also with respect to the claim that he conspired to present such testimony.  Id., at 841.  To allow liability to be predicated on the alleged conspiracy, the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would be to permit through the back door what is prohibited through the front.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

We consult the common law to identify those governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are performed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98with independence and without fear of consequences.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pierson, supra, at 554 (quoting Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 350, n.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa1 (1872)).  Taking this approach, we have identified the following functions that are absolutely immune from liability for damages under \xc2\xa71983: actions taken by legislators within the legitimate scope of legislative authority, see Tenney, supra; actions taken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial authority, see Pierson, supra; actions taken by prosecutors in their role as advocates, see Imbler, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430\xe2\x80\x93431; and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial, see Briscoe, supra.  By contrast, the Court has found no absolute immunity for the acts of the chief executive officer of a State, the senior and subordinate officers of a State\xe2\x80\x99s National Guard, the president of a state university, see Scheuer v.

When \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor was enacted in 1871, it was common for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private parties.  See, e.g., Stewart v. Sonneborn, \n\n98 U.\xc2\xa0S. 187, \n198 (1879)\n (Bradley, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]very man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit\xe2\x80\x9d).  And private prosecutors, like private plaintiffs in civil suits, did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit.  See Malley, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 340\xe2\x80\x93341, and n.\xc2\xa03 (citing cases).  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthe generally accepted rule\xe2\x80\x9d was that a private complainant who procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable in an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant acted with malice and without probable cause.  See id., at 340\xe2\x80\x93341; see also Briscoe, 460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 351 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cBoth English and American courts routinely permitted plaintiffs to bring actions alleging that the de- fendant had made a false and malicious accusation of a felony to a magistrate or other judicial officer\xe2\x80\x9d); Wheeler v.

Wilkes, 12 How. 390, 402 (1852) (no immunity \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a party had maliciously, and without probable cause, procured the plaintiff to be indicted or arrested for an offence of which he was not guilty\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the decades after the adoption of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, however, the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials, and common-law courts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert, namely, claims for malicious prosecution or defamation.  See Imbler, supra, at 441\xe2\x80\x93442 (White, J., concurring in judgment); Kalina, supra, at 124, n.\xc2\xa011 (noting that cases \xe2\x80\x9cdecided after 1871 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. granted a broader immunity to public prosecutors than had been available in malicious prosecution actions against private persons who brought prosecutions at early common law\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Burns, supra, at 505 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law tradition of prosecutorial immunity .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. developed much later than 1871\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommo- dated the special needs of public, as opposed to private, prosecutors.  Because the daily function of a public prosecutor is to bring criminal charges, tort claims against public prosecutors \xe2\x80\x9ccould be expected with some frequency, for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the State\xe2\x80\x99s advocate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Imbler, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 425.  Such \xe2\x80\x9charassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s energies from his public duties,\xe2\x80\x9d and would result in a severe interference with the administration of an important public office.  Id., at 423.  Constant vulnerability to vexatious litigation would give rise to the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility that [the prosecutor] would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity un- der \xc2\xa71983 reached this Court in Imbler, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead placed substantial reliance on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for common-law torts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the Court has looked to the common law in determining the scope of the absolute immunity available under \xc2\xa71983, the Court has not suggested that \xc2\xa71983 is simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims, an all-in-one federal claim encompassing the torts of assault, trespass, false arrest, defamation, malicious prosecution, and more.  The new federal claim created by \xc2\xa71983 differs in important ways from those pre-existing torts.  It is broader in that it reaches constitutional and statutory violations that do not correspond to any previously known tort.  See Kalina, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 123.  But it is narrower in that it applies only to tortfeasors who act under color of state law.  See Briscoe, supra, at 329.

Garcia, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 261, \n272 (1985)\n (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in \xc2\xa71983 actions differ in some respects from the common law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt common law, trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form of absolute immunity for statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding: They had complete immunity against slander and libel claims, even if it was alleged that the statements in question were maliciously false.

When a witness is sued because of his testimony, the Court wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of public policy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 332\xe2\x80\x93333 (quoting Calkins v. Sumner, 13 Wis. 193, 197 (1860)).  Without absolute immunity for witnesses, the Court concluded, the truth-seeking process at trial would be impaired.  Witnesses \xe2\x80\x9cmight be reluctant to come forward to testify,\xe2\x80\x9d and even if a witness took the stand, the witness \xe2\x80\x9cmight be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cfear of subsequent liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 333.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe factors that justify absolute immunity for trial witnesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.  In both contexts, a witness\xe2\x80\x99 fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.  And in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent perjurious testimony.  In Briscoe, the Court concluded that the possibility of civil liability was not needed to deter false testimony at trial because other sanctions\xe2\x80\x94chiefly prosecution for perjury\xe2\x80\x94provided a sufficient deterrent.  Id., at 342.  Since perjury before a grand jury, like perjury at trial, is a serious criminal offense, see, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71623(a), there is no reason to think that this deterrent is any less effective in preventing false grand jury testimony.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeither is there any reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses.  In Briscoe, it was argued that absolute immunity was not needed for police-officer witnesses, but the Court refused to draw that distinction.  The Court wrote:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a police officer appears as a witness, he may reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness sworn to tell the truth\xe2\x80\x94in which event he can make a strong claim to witness immunity; alternatively, he may be regarded as an official performing a critical role in the judicial process, in which event he may seek the benefit afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding.  Nothing in the language of the statute suggests that such a witness belongs in a narrow, special category lacking protection against damages suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 335\xe2\x80\x93336 (footnote omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tSee also id., at 342 (\xe2\x80\x9cA police officer on the witness stand performs the same functions as any other witness\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Briscoe Court rebuffed two arguments for distinguishing between law enforcement witnesses and lay witnesses for immunity purposes: first, that absolute im- munity is not needed for law enforcement witnesses because they are less likely to be intimidated by the threat of suit and, second, that such witnesses should not be shielded by absolute immunity because false testimony by a police officer is likely to be more damaging than false testimony by a lay witness.  See ibid.  The Court observed that there are other factors not applicable to lay witnesses that weigh in favor of extending absolute immunity to police officer witnesses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, police officers testify with some frequency.  Id., at 343.  \xe2\x80\x9cPolice officers testify in scores of cases every year,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cand defendants often will transform resentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury by the State\xe2\x80\x99s official witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  If police officer witnesses were routinely forced to defend against claims based on their testimony, their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (quoting Imbler, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 425).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, a police officer witness\xe2\x80\x99 potential liability, if conditioned on the exoneration of the accused, could influence decisions on appeal and collateral relief.  460 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 344.  Needless to say, such decisions should not be influenced by the likelihood of a subsequent civil rights action.  But the possibility that a decision favorable to the accused might subject a police officer witness to liability would create the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98risk of injecting extraneous concerns\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d into appellate review and postconviction proceedings.  Ibid. (quoting Imbler, supra, at 428, n.\xc2\xa027).  In addition, law enforcement witnesses face the possibility of sanctions not applicable to lay witnesses, namely, loss of their jobs and other employment-related sanctions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, we conclude that grand jury wit- nesses should enjoy the same immunity as witnesses at trial.  This means that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any \xc2\xa71983 claim based on the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony.  In addition, as the Court of Appeals held, this rule may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony or by using evidence of the witness\xe2\x80\x99 testimony to support any other \xc2\xa71983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution.  Were it otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9ca criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could simply reframe a claim to attack the preparation instead of the absolutely immune actions themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  Buckley v.

In the vast majority of cases involving a claim against a grand jury witness, the witness and the prose- cutor conducting the investigation engage in preparatory activity, such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony.

See Brief for Petitioner 17\xe2\x80\x9322.  In those cases, law enforcement officials who submitted affidavits in support of applications for arrest warrants were denied absolute immunity because they \xe2\x80\x9cperformed the function of a complaining witness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kalina, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 131; see Malley, 475 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 340\xe2\x80\x93341.  Relying on these cases, petitioner contends that certain grand jury witnesses\xe2\x80\x94namely, those who qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not entitled to absolute immunity.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinctive function played by a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d during the period when \xc2\xa71983\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor was enacted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt that time, the term \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d was used to refer to a party who procured an arrest and initiated a criminal prosecution, see Kalina, 522 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 135 (Scalia, J., concurring).  A \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d might not actually ever testify, and thus the term \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98witness\xe2\x80\x99 in \xe2\x80\x98complaining witness\xe2\x80\x99 is misleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

But testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness.\xe2\x80\x9d  See M. Newell, Malicious Prosecution 368 (1892).  Nor have we been presented with evidence that witnesses who did no more than testify before a grand jury were regarded as complaining witnesses and were successfully sued for malicious prosecution.

It is of course true that a detective or case agent who has performed or supervised most of the investigative work in a case  may serve as an important witness in the grand jury proceeding and may very much want the grand jury to return an indictment.  But such a witness, unlike a complaining witness at common law, does not make the decision to press criminal charges.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInstead, it is almost always a prosecutor who is responsible for the decision to present a case to a grand jury, and in many jurisdictions, even if an indictment is handed up, a prosecution cannot proceed unless the prosecutor signs the indictment.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It would thus be anomalous to permit a police officer who testifies before a grand jury to be sued for maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for the decision to prosecute.

But where multiple witnesses testify before a grand jury, identifying the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d would often be difficult.  Petitioner suggests that a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9csomeone who sets the prosecution in motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 15.  And petitioner maintains that the same distinction made at common law between complaining witnesses and other witnesses applies in \xc2\xa71983 actions.  See id., at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  But, as we have explained, a complaining witness played a dis- tinctive role, and therefore even when a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d testified, there was a clear basis for distinguishing between the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witness\xe2\x80\x9d and other wit- nesses.  Because no modern grand jury witness plays a comparable role, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test would be of little use.  Consider a case in which the case agent or lead detective testifies before the grand jury and provides a wealth of background information and then a cooperating witness appears and furnishes critical incriminating testimony.  Or suppose that two witnesses each provide essential testimony regarding different counts of an indictment or different elements of an offense.  In these cases, which witnesses would be \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and thus vulnerable to suit based on their testimony?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner contends that the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in the grand jury context because trial witnesses are exposed to cross-examination, which is designed to expose perjury.  See Brief for Petitioner 21, 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  This argument overlooks the fact that a critical grand jury witness is likely to testify again at trial and may be cross-examined at that time.  But in any event, the force of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is more than offset by a special problem that would be created by allowing civil actions against grand jury witnesses\xe2\x80\x94subversion of grand jury secrecy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We consistently have recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., \n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 418, \n424 (1983)\n (quoting Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, \n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n\xe2\x80\x93219 (1979)). \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[I]f preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony.  Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 424.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAllowing \xc2\xa71983 actions against grand jury witnesses would compromise this vital secrecy.  If the testimony of witnesses before a grand jury could provide the basis for, or could be used as evidence supporting, a \xc2\xa71983 claim, the identities of grand jury witnesses could be discovered by filing a \xc2\xa71983 action and moving for the disclosure of the transcript of grand jury proceedings.  Especially in cases involving violent criminal organizations or other subjects who might retaliate against adverse grand jury witnesses, the threat of such disclosure might seriously undermine the grand jury process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, contrary to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction between States that use grand juries and those that do not.  Petitioner argues that it would make no sense to distinguish for purposes of \xc2\xa71983 immunity between prosecutions initiated by the return of a grand jury indictment and those initiated by the filing of a complaint or information, and he notes that 26 States permit felony prosecutions to be brought by information.  Brief for Petitioner 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  But petitioner draws the wrong analogy.  In States that permit felony prosecutions to be initiated by information, the closest analog to a grand jury witness is a witness at a preliminary hearing.  Most of the States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at which witnesses testify.  See LaFave \xc2\xa714.2(d), at 304, and n.\xc2\xa047, 307, and n.\xc2\xa060.  The lower courts have held that witnesses at a preliminary hearing are protected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses, see, e.g., Brice v. Nkaru, 220 F.\xc2\xa03d 233, 239, n.\xc2\xa06 (CA4 2000); Curtis v. Bembenek, 48 F.\xc2\xa03d 281, 284\xe2\x80\x93285 (CA7 1995) (citing cases), and petitioner does not argue otherwise, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, we hold that a grand jury witness is entitled to the same immunity as a trial witness.

For example, we have accorded only qualified immunity to law enforcement officials who falsify affidavits, see Kalina v. Fletcher, \n\xe2\x80\x93131 (1997); Malley v. Briggs, \n\xe2\x80\x93345 (1986), and fabricate evidence concerning an unsolved crime, see Buckley, 509 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 272\xe2\x80\x93276.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The federal courts have concluded uniformly that Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing that an indictment \xe2\x80\x9cmust be signed by an attorney for the government,\xe2\x80\x9d precludes federal grand juries from issuing an indictment without the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s signature, signifying his or her approval.

Brief for Petitioner 2, 23.  But this is like saying thata bicycle and an F-16 are the same thing.  Even if the functions are similar as a general matter, the entities are quite different.  Grand juries, by tradition, statute, and sometimes constitutional mandate, have a status and entitlement to information that absolute immunity furthers.  See, e.g., Imbler v. Pachtman, \n, n.\xc2\xa020 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the functional comparability of their judgments to those ofthe judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors be-ing referred to as \xe2\x80\x98quasi-judicial\xe2\x80\x99 officers, and their immunities being termed \xe2\x80\x98quasi-judicial\xe2\x80\x99 as well\xe2\x80\x9d); see also United States v.

Our holding today supports the functioning of the grand jury system.  The importance of the grand jury cannot be underestimated: In the federal system and many States, see LaFave \xc2\xa715.1(d), a felony cannot be charged without the consent of community representatives, a vital protection from unwarranted prosecutions.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
