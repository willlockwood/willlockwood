JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Defendants in error were indicted for an alleged violation of the so-called meat inspection law, which is a part of the "Act Making Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture." etc., approved June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. c. 3913, pp. 669, 674, etc.  Upon motion of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="283">Page 235 U. S. 283</a></p><p> defendants, the district court quashed the indictment, basing its decision upon the construction of the statute, and the government has brought this writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. c. 2564, p. 1246.</p>\n<p>The pertinent portions of the meat inspection law are set forth in the margin. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/235/282/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="284">Page 235 U. S. 284</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Pursuant to the authority conferred by it, the Secretary of Agriculture made certain rules and regulations, effective May 1, 1908, among which was the following:</p>\n<p>"An official establishment may ship from the said establishment to any other official establishment any meat </p><p><a class="page-number" name="285">Page 235 U. S. 285</a></p><p> or meat food product which has been inspected and passed under these regulations without marking the same \'Inspected and passed,\' if such shipment be placed in a railroad </p><p><a class="page-number" name="286">Page 235 U. S. 286</a></p><p> car which is sealed by an employee of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and provided that not less than 25 percent of the contents of each car consists of meat or meat food products not marked \'Inspected and passed.\'"</p>\n<p>Reg. 25, \xc2\xa7 12, par. 1.</p>\n<p>The indictment charged, in substance, that defendants knowingly and wrongfully altered, defaced, broke, and destroyed a certain government seal, then being upon a certain railroad freight car containing meat and meat products then under government supervision for inspection and offered for transportation in interstate commerce, the seal having been affixed to the car in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture.  The clauses of the statute upon which the indictment rests are those which declare:</p>\n<p>"That no person, firm or corporation, or officer, agent, or employee thereof, shall . . . knowingly or wrongfully alter, deface, or destroy . . . any of the marks, stamps, tags, labels, or other identification devices provided for in this Act, or in and as directed by the rules and regulations prescribed hereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture, on any carcasses, parts of carcasses, or the food product, or containers thereof, subject to the provisions of this Act,"</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>"That any person, firm, or corporation, or any officer or agent of any such person, firm, or corporation, who shall violate any of the provisions of this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor."</p>\n<p>The district court construed the prohibition as relating alone to those engaged in the business of preparing meats for transportation, and the carrying or assisting in the carrying of such meats in interstate transportation.  We are unable to discern any sufficient reason for giving to the language of the statute so limited an application.  The plain object of the clause is to safeguard the food products in question against alteration or substitution, and thus enable the officials of the government to systematize </p><p><a class="page-number" name="287">Page 235 U. S. 287</a></p><p> and render effective the process of inspection, an object that is interfered with if the tags or other identification devices are destroyed, whether they be destroyed by those engaged in the business or by others.  Moreover, one of the other prohibitions of the act is in terms limited to those engaged in the interstate commerce of meat or meat food products.</p>\n<p>It seems to us clear that the prohibition upon which the present indictment is founded has an effect as broad as its language, and applies to any and every "person, firm, or corporation, or officer, agent, or employee thereof."  <em>See United States v.

passed\' all such products found to be sound, healthful, and wholesome, and which contain no dyes, chemicals, preservatives, or ingredients which render such meat or meat products unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or unfit for human food, and said inspectors shall label, mark, stamp, or tag as \'Inspected and condemned\' all such products found unsound, unhealthful, and unwholesome, or which contain dyes, chemicals preservatives, or ingredients which render such meat or meat food products unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or unfit for human food, and all such condemned meat food

maintained, the person, firm, or corporation preparing said product shall cause a label to be attached to said can, pot, tin, canvas, or other receptacle or covering, under the supervision of an inspector, which label shall state that the contents thereof have been \'inspected and passed\' under the provisions of this Act, and no inspection and examination of meat or meat food products deposited or enclosed in cans, tins, pots, canvas, or other receptacle or covering in any establishment where inspection under the provisions of this Act is maintained shall be deemed to be complete
