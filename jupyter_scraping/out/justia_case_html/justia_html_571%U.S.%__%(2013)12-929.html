The subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia.  When a dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of Texas.  Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71406(a) and \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).  In the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71404(a).  The District Court denied both motions.  It concluded that \xc2\xa71404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under \xc2\xa71404(a); and that the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors, only one of which was the forum-selection clause.  After weighing those factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marine\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under \xc2\xa71406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under \xc2\xa71404(a).

Title \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391, which governs venue generally, states that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in\xe2\x80\x9d federal district courts.  \xc2\xa71391(a)(1).  It then defines districts in which venue is proper.  See \xc2\xa71391(b).  If a case falls within one of \xc2\xa71391(b)\xe2\x80\x99s districts, venue is proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under \xc2\xa71406(a).  Whether the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract contains a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the specified districts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue provisions, which reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal ju- risdiction over the defendant.  See \xc2\xa71391(b)(3).  The conclusion also follows from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions construing the federal venue statutes.  See Van Dusen v.

Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the federal court system.  When a forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another federal court.  Sinochem Int\xe2\x80\x99l Co. v.

But when the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract contains a valid forum-selection clause, that clause \xe2\x80\x9crepresents [their] agreement as to the most proper forum,\xe2\x80\x9d Stewart, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 31, and should be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The presence of a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to adjust their usual \xc2\xa71404(a) analysis in three ways.  First, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s choice of forum merits no weight, and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted.  Second, the court should not consider the parties\xe2\x80\x99 private interests aside from those embodied in the forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests.  Because public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases.  Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a \xc2\xa71404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue\xe2\x80\x99s choice-of-law rules.

The court improperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contractually preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer.  It also erred in giving weight to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 private interests outside those expressed in the forum-selection clause.  And its holding that public interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Virginia rested in part on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken belief that the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas\xe2\x80\x99 choice-of-law rules instead of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s.

Instead, a forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under \xc2\xa71404(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\xe2\x80\x9d  When a defendant files such a motion, we conclude, a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.

Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimproper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether venue is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing about a forum-selection clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 1406(a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 12(b)(3) states that a party may move to dismiss a case for \xe2\x80\x9cimproper venue.\xe2\x80\x9d  These provisions therefore authorize dismissal only when venue is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d in the forum in which it was brought.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis question\xe2\x80\x94whether venue is \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is generally governed by \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391 (2006 ed., Supp. V).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That provision states that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71391(a)(1) (emphasis added).  It further provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] civil action may be brought in\xe2\x80\x94(1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71391(b).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  When venue is challenged, the court must determine whether the case falls within one of the three categories set out in \xc2\xa71391(b).  If it does, venue is proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under \xc2\xa71406(a).  Whether the parties entered into a contract containing a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the categories of cases listed in \xc2\xa71391(b).  As a result, a case filed in a district that falls within \xc2\xa71391 may not be dismissed under \xc2\xa71406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view improperly conflates the special statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cvenue\xe2\x80\x9d and the word \xe2\x80\x9cforum.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is certainly true that, in some contexts, the word \xe2\x80\x9cvenue\xe2\x80\x9d is used synonymously with the term \xe2\x80\x9cforum,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xc2\xa71391 makes clear that venue in \xe2\x80\x9call civil actions\xe2\x80\x9d must be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that section.  That language cannot reasonably be read to allow judicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations on the forum in which a case may be brought.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe structure of the federal venue provisions confirms that they alone define whether venue exists in a given forum.  In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  The first two paragraphs of \xc2\xa71391(b) define the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical case, but the third paragraph provides a fallback option: If no other venue is proper, then venue will lie in \xe2\x80\x9cany judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court\xe2\x80\x99s personal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  The statute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant, venue will always lie somewhere.  As we have previously noted, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress does not in general intend to create venue gaps, which take away with one hand what Congress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith v. United States, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 197, \n203 (1993)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s approach would mean that in some number of cases\xe2\x80\x94those in which the forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign court\xe2\x80\x94venue would not lie in any federal district.  That would not comport with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s design, which contemplates that venue will always exist in some federal court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe conclusion that venue is proper so long as the requirements of \xc2\xa71391(b) are met, irrespective of any forum-selection clause, also follows from our prior decisions construing the federal venue statutes.  In Van Dusen v. Barrack, \n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 612 (1964)\n, we considered the meaning of \xc2\xa71404(a), which authorizes a district court to \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  The question in Van Dusen was whether \xc2\xa71404(a) allows transfer to a district in which venue is proper under \xc2\xa71391 but in which the case could not have been pursued in light of substantive state-law limitations on the suit.  See id., at 614\xe2\x80\x93615.  In holding that transfer is permissible in that context, we construed the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwhere it might have been brought\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal laws delimiting the districts in which such an action \xe2\x80\x98may be brought,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 624, noting that  \xe2\x80\x9cthe phrase \xe2\x80\x98may be brought\xe2\x80\x99 recurs at least 10 times\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71391\xe2\x80\x931406, id., at 622.  We perceived \xe2\x80\x9cno valid reason for reading the words \xe2\x80\x98where it might have been brought\xe2\x80\x99 to narrow the range of permissible federal forums beyond those permitted by federal venue statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 623.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we noted in Van Dusen, \xc2\xa71406(a) \xe2\x80\x9cshares the same statutory context\xe2\x80\x9d as \xc2\xa71404(a) and \xe2\x80\x9ccontain[s] a similar phrase.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 621, n.\xc2\xa011.  It instructs a court to transfer a case from the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d district to a district \xe2\x80\x9cin which it could have been brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  The most reasonable interpretation of that provision is that a district cannot be \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d if it is one in which the case could have been brought under \xc2\xa71391.  Under the construction of the venue laws we adopted in Van Dusen, a \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d district is therefore a district other than \xe2\x80\x9cthose districts in which Congress has provided by its venue statutes that the action \xe2\x80\x98may be brought.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 618 (emphasis added).  If the federal venue statutes establish that suit may be brought in a particular district, a contractual bar cannot render venue in that district \xe2\x80\x9cwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur holding also finds support in Stewart, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 22\n.  As here, the parties in Stewart had included a forum-selection clause in the relevant contract, but the plaintiff filed suit in a different federal district.  The defendant had initially moved to transfer the case or, in the alternative, to dismiss for improper venue under \xc2\xa71406(a), but by the time the case reached this Court, the defendant had abandoned its \xc2\xa71406(a) argument and sought only transfer under \xc2\xa71404(a).  We rejected the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s argument that state law governs a motion to transfer venue pursuant to a forum-selection clause, concluding instead that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal law, specifically \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71404(a), governs the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to give effect to the parties\xe2\x80\x99  forum-selection clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 32.  We went on to explain that a \xe2\x80\x9cmotion to transfer under \xc2\xa71404(a)\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. calls on the district court to weigh in the balance a number of case-specific factors\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cpresence of a forum-selection clause\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will be a significant factor that figures centrally in the district court\xe2\x80\x99s calculus.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 29.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe question whether venue in the original court was \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71406(a) was not before the Court, but we wrote in a footnote that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he parties do not dispute that the District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71406(a) because respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama.  See \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71391(c) (venue proper in judicial district in which corporation is doing business).\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 28, n.\xc2\xa08.  In other words, because \xc2\xa71391 made venue proper, venue could not be \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71406(a).  Though dictum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s observation supports the holding we reach today.  A contrary view would all but drain Stewart of any significance.  If a forum-selection clause rendered venue in all other federal courts \xe2\x80\x9cwrong,\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant could always obtain automatic dismissal or transfer under \xc2\xa71406(a) and would not have any reason to resort to \xc2\xa71404(a).  Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s holding would be limited to the presumably rare case in which the defendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under \xc2\xa71406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimproper\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa71406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under \xc2\xa71404(a).  That provision states that \xe2\x80\x9c[f\xc2\xa0]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike \xc2\xa71406(a), \xc2\xa71404(a) does not condition transfer on the ini- tial forum\xe2\x80\x99s being \xe2\x80\x9cwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it permits transfer to any district where venue is also proper (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cwhere [the case] might have been brought\xe2\x80\x9d) or to any other district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for enforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a particular federal district.  And for the reasons we address in Part III, infra, a proper application of \xc2\xa71404(a) requires that a forum-selection clause be \xe2\x80\x9cgiven controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stewart, supra, at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAtlantic Marine argues that \xc2\xa71404(a) is not a suitable mechanism to enforce forum-selection clauses because that provision cannot provide for transfer when a forum-selection clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal, see Brief for Petitioner 18\xe2\x80\x9319, and we agree with Atlantic Marine that the Court of Appeals failed to provide a sound answer to this problem.  The Court of Appeals opined that a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum should be enforced through Rule 12(b)(3), which permits a party to move for dismissal of a case based on \xe2\x80\x9cimproper venue.\xe2\x80\x9d  701 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 740.  As Atlantic Marine persua- sively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be reconciled with our construction of the term \xe2\x80\x9cimproper venue\xe2\x80\x9d in  \xc2\xa71406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal venue laws.  If venue is proper under federal venue rules, it does not matter for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(3) whether the forum-selection clause points to a federal or a nonfederal forum.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInstead, the appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  Section 1404(a) is merely a codification of the doctrine of forum non conveniens for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is within the federal court system; in such cases, Congress has replaced the traditional remedy of outright dismissal with transfer.  See Sinochem Int\xe2\x80\x99l Co. v. Malaysia Int\xe2\x80\x99l Shipping Corp., \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 422, \n430 (2007)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cFor the federal court system, Congress has codified the doctrine\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also notes following \xc2\xa71404 (Historical and Revision Notes) (Section 1404(a) \xe2\x80\x9cwas drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the venue is proper\xe2\x80\x9d).  For the remaining set of cases calling for a nonfederal forum, \xc2\xa71404(a) has no application, but the residual doctrine of forum non conveniens \xe2\x80\x9chas continuing application in federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sinochem, 549 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also ibid. (noting that federal courts invoke forum non conveniens \xe2\x80\x9cin cases where the alternative forum is abroad, and perhaps in rare instances where a state or territorial court serves litigational convenience best\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  And because both \xc2\xa71404(a) and the forum non conveniens doctrine from which it derives entail the same balancing-of-interests standard, courts should evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the same way that they evaluate a forum-selection clause pointing to a federal forum.

See Brief for Stephen E. Sachs as Amicus Curiae.  Petitioner, however, did not file a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), and the parties did not brief the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s application to this case at any stage of this litigation.  We therefore will not consider it.  Even if a defendant could use Rule 12(b)(6) to enforce a forum-selection clause, that would not change our conclusions that \xc2\xa71406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) are not proper mechanisms to enforce a forum-selection clause and that \xc2\xa71404(a) and the forum non conveniens doctrine provide appropriate enforcement mechanisms.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the Court of Appeals correctly identified \xc2\xa71404(a) as the appropriate provision to enforce the forum-selection clause in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in failing to make the adjustments required in a \xc2\xa71404(a) analysis when the transfer motion is premised on a forum-selection clause.  When the parties have agreed to a valid forum-selection clause, a district court should ordinarily transfer the case to the forum specified in that clause.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Only under extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties should a \xc2\xa71404(a) motion be denied.

The \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement of valid forum-selection clauses, bargained for by the parties, protects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital interests of the justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  For that reason, and because the overarching consideration under \xc2\xa71404(a) is whether a transfer would promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca valid forum-selection clause [should be] given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 33 (same).  The presence of a valid forum-selection clause requires district courts to adjust their usual \xc2\xa71404(a) analysis in three ways.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s choice of forum merits no weight.  Rather, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted.  Because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select whatever forum they consider most advantageous (consistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations), we have termed their selection the \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s venue privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Van Dusen, 376 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 635.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But when a plaintiff agrees by contract to bring suit only in a specified forum\xe2\x80\x94presumably in exchange for other binding promises by the defendant\xe2\x80\x94the plaintiff has effectively exercised its \xe2\x80\x9cvenue privilege\xe2\x80\x9d before a dispute arises.  Only that initial choice deserves deference, and the plaintiff must bear the burden of showing why the court should not transfer the case to the forum to which the parties agreed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, a court evaluating a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71404(a) motion to transfer based on a forum-selection clause should not consider arguments about the parties\xe2\x80\x99 private interests.  When parties agree to a forum-selection clause, they waive the right to challenge the preselected forum as inconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their witnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation.  A court accordingly must deem the private-interest factors to weigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum.  As we have explained in a different but \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98instructive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d context, Stewart, supra, at 28, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hatever \xe2\x80\x98inconvenience\xe2\x80\x99 [the parties] would suffer by being forced to litigate in the contractual forum as [they] agreed to do was clearly foreseeable at the time of contracting.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., \n\n407 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x9318 (1972); see also Stewart, supra, at 33 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (stating that Bremen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creasoning applies with much force to federal courts sitting in diversity\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a consequence, a district court may consider arguments about public-interest factors only.  See n.\xc2\xa06, supra.  Because those factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases.  Although it is \xe2\x80\x9cconceiv- able in a particular case\xe2\x80\x9d that the district court \xe2\x80\x9cwould refuse to transfer a case notwithstanding the counterweight of a forum-selection clause,\xe2\x80\x9d Stewart, supra, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331, such cases will not be common.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a \xc2\xa71404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue\xe2\x80\x99s choice-of-law rules\xe2\x80\x94a factor that in some circumstances may affect public-interest considerations.  See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (1981) (listing a court\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with the \xe2\x80\x9claw that must govern the action\xe2\x80\x9d as a potential factor).  A federal court sitting in diversity ordinarily must follow the choice-of-law rules of the State in which it sits.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., \n\n313 U.\xc2\xa0S. 487\n\xe2\x80\x93496 (1941).  However, we previously identified an exception to that prin- ciple for \xc2\xa71404(a) transfers, requiring that the state law applicable in the original court also apply in the trans- feree court.  See Van Dusen, 376 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 639.  We deemed that exception necessary to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants, properly subjected to suit in the transferor State,\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cinvok[ing] \xc2\xa71404(a) to gain the benefits of the laws of another jurisdiction\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 638; see Ferens v. John Deere Co., \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 516, \n522 (1990)\n (extending the Van Dusen rule to \xc2\xa71404(a) motions by plaintiffs).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe policies motivating our exception to the Klaxon rule for \xc2\xa71404(a) transfers, however, do not support an extension to cases where a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s motion is premised on enforcement of a valid forum-selection clause.  See Ferens, supra, at 523.  To the contrary, those considerations lead us to reject the rule that the law of the court in which the plaintiff inappropriately filed suit should follow the case to the forum contractually selected by the parties.  In Van Dusen, we were concerned that, through a \xc2\xa71404(a) transfer, a defendant could \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat the state-law advantages that might accrue from the exercise of [the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s] venue privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  376 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 635.  But as discussed above, a plaintiff who files suit in violation of a forum-selection clause enjoys no such \xe2\x80\x9cprivilege\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to its choice of forum, and therefore it is entitled to no concomitant \xe2\x80\x9cstate-law advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not only would it be inequitable to allow the plaintiff to fasten its choice of substantive law to the venue transfer, but it would also encourage gamesmanship.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71404(a) should not create or multiply opportunities for forum shopping,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferens, supra, at 523, we will not apply the Van Dusen rule when a transfer stems from enforcement of a forum-selection clause: The court in the contractually selected venue should not apply the law of the transferor venue to which the parties waived their right.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen parties have contracted in advance to litigate disputes in a particular forum, courts should not unnecessarily disrupt the parties\xe2\x80\x99 settled expectations.  A forum-selection clause, after all, may have figured centrally in the parties\xe2\x80\x99 negotiations and may have affected how they set monetary and other contractual terms; it may, in fact, have been a critical factor in their agreement to do business together in the first place.  In all but the most un-usual cases, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cthe interest of justice\xe2\x80\x9d is served by holding parties to their bargain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of \xc2\xa71404(a) in this case did not comport with these principles.  The District Court improperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contractually preselected forum was appropriate.  As the party acting in violation of the forum-selection clause, J-Crew must bear the burden of showing that public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavor a transfer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court also erred in giving weight to arguments about the parties\xe2\x80\x99 private interests, given that all private interests, as expressed in the forum-selection clause, weigh in favor of the transfer.  The District Court stated that the private-interest factors \xe2\x80\x9cmilitat[e] against a transfer to Virginia\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory process will not be available for the majority of J-Crew\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d and there will be \xe2\x80\x9csignificant expense for those willing witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  2012 WL 8499879, *6\xe2\x80\x93*7; see 701 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 743 (noting District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconcer[n] with J-Crew\xe2\x80\x99s ability to secure witnesses for trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  But when J-Crew entered into a contract to litigate all disputes in Virginia, it knew that a distant forum might hinder its ability to call certain witnesses and might impose other burdens on its litigation efforts.  It nevertheless promised to resolve its disputes in Virginia, and the District Court should not have given any weight to J-Crew\xe2\x80\x99s current claims of inconvenience.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court also held that the public-interest factors weighed in favor of keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to their federal colleagues in Vir- ginia.  That ruling, however, rested in part on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s belief that the federal court sitting in Virginia would have been required to apply Texas\xe2\x80\x99 choice-of-law rules, which in this case pointed to Texas contract law.  See 2012 WL 8499879, *8 (citing Van Dusen, supra, at 639).  But for the reasons we have explained, the trans- feree court would apply Virginia choice-of-law rules.  It is true that even these Virginia rules may point to the contract law of Texas, as the State in which the contract was formed.  But at minimum, the fact that the Virginia court will not be required to apply Texas choice-of-law rules reduces whatever weight the District Court might have given to the public-interest factor that looks to the familiarity of the transferee court with the applicable law.  And, in any event, federal judges routinely apply the law of a State other than the State in which they sit.  We are not aware of any exceptionally arcane features of Texas contract law that are likely to defy comprehension by a fed- eral judge sitting in Virginia.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
