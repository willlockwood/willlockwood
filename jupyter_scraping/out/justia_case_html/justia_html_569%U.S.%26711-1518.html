The trust\xe2\x80\x99s sole asset was the father\xe2\x80\x99s life insurance policy.  Petitioner borrowed funds from the trust three times; all borrowed funds were repaid with interest.  His siblings obtained a judgment against him in state court for breach of fiduciary duty, though the court found no apparent malicious motive.  The court imposed constructive trusts on certain of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interests\xe2\x80\x94including his interest in the original trust\xe2\x80\x94in order to secure petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s payment of the judgment, with respondent serving as trustee for all of the trusts.  Petitioner filed for bankruptcy.  Respondent opposed discharge of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s state-court-imposed debts to the trust, and the Bankruptcy Court granted respondent summary judgment, holding that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s debts were not dischargeable pursuant to \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(4), which provides that an individual cannot obtain a bankruptcy discharge from a debt \xe2\x80\x9cfor fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federal District Court and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.

Broad definitions of the term in modern and older dictionaries are unhelpful, and courts of appeals have disagreed about what mental state must accompany defalcation\xe2\x80\x99s definition.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x88\x925.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0In Neal v. Clark, \n\n95 U.\xc2\xa0S. 704\n, this Court interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d in the Bankruptcy Code\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions to discharge to mean \xe2\x80\x9cpositive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, as does embezzlement; and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 709.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d should be treated similarly.  Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad faith, moral turpitude, or other immoral conduct, \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d requires an intentional wrong.  An intentional wrong includes not only conduct that the fiduciary knows is improper but also reckless conduct of the kind that the criminal law often treats as the equivalent.  Where actual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, conduct is considered as equivalent if, as set forth in the Model Penal Code, the fiduciary \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously disregards,\xe2\x80\x9d or is willfully blind to, \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial and unjustifiable risk\xe2\x80\x9d that his conduct will violate a fiduciary duty.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x88\x927.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0Several considerations support this interpretation.  First, statutory context strongly favors it.  The canon noscitur a sociis argues for interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d as similar to its linguistic neighbors \xe2\x80\x9cembezzlement,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clarceny,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d which all require a showing of wrongful or felonious intent.  See, e.g., Neal, supra, at 709.  Second, the interpretation does not make the word identical to its statutory neighbors.  \xe2\x80\x9cEmbezzlement\xe2\x80\x9d requires conversion, \xe2\x80\x9clarceny\xe2\x80\x9d requires taking and carrying away another\xe2\x80\x99s property, and \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d typically requires a false statement or omission; while \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d can encompass a breach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conversion, nor taking and carrying away another\xe2\x80\x99s property, nor falsity.  Third, the interpretation is consistent with the longstanding principle that \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions to discharge \xe2\x80\x98should be confined to those plainly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Kawaauhau v. Geiger, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57\n.  It is also consistent with statutory exceptions to discharge that Congress normally confines to circumstances where strong, special policy considerations, such as the presence of fault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby benefiting, for example, a typically more honest creditor.  See, e.g., \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A).  Fourth, some Circuits have interpreted the statute similarly for many years without administrative or other difficulties.  Finally, it is important to have a uniform interpretation of federal law, the choices are limited, and neither the parties nor the Government has presented strong considerations favoring a different interpretation.

In 1984, petitioner again borrowed funds from the trust, this time using the funds to pay for certificates of deposit, which he and his mother used to buy a mill.

On the one hand, a law dictionary in use in 1867 defines the word \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of a defaulter,\xe2\x80\x9d which, in turn, it defines broadly as one \xe2\x80\x9cwho is deficient in his accounts, or fails in making his accounts correct.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 J.

Justice Harlan wrote for the Court:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[D]ebts created by \xe2\x80\x98fraud\xe2\x80\x99 are associated directly with debts created by \xe2\x80\x98embezzlement.\xe2\x80\x99  Such association justifies, if it does not imperatively require, the conclusion that the \xe2\x80\x98fraud\xe2\x80\x99 referred to in that section means positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong, as does embezzlement; and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Neal v. Clark, \n\n95 U.\xc2\xa0S. 704, \n709 (1878)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tWe believe that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d should be treated similarly.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad faith, moral turpitude, or other immoral conduct, the term requires an intentional wrong.  We include as intentional not only conduct that the fiduciary knows is improper but also reckless conduct of the kind that the criminal law often treats as the equivalent.  Thus, we include reckless conduct of the kind set forth in the Model Penal Code.  Where actual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, we consider conduct as equivalent if the fiduciary \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously disregards\xe2\x80\x9d (or is willfully blind to) \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial and unjustifiable risk\xe2\x80\x9d that his conduct will turn out to violate a fiduciary duty.  ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02(2)(c), p. 226 (1985).  See id., \xc2\xa72.02 Comment 9, at 248 (explaining that the Model Penal Code\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge\xe2\x80\x9d was designed to include \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wilful blindness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  That risk \xe2\x80\x9cmust be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and the cir- cumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor\xe2\x80\x99s situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., \xc2\xa72.02(2)(c), at 226 (emphasis added).  Cf. Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, \n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185\n, n.\xc2\xa012 (1976) (defining scienter for securities law purposes as \xe2\x80\x9ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSeveral considerations lead us to interpret the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d in this way.  First, as Justice Harlan pointed out in Neal, statutory context strongly favors this interpretation.  Applying the canon of interpretation noscitur a sociis, the Court there looked to fraud\xe2\x80\x99s linguistic neighbor, \xe2\x80\x9cembezzlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  It found that both terms refer to different forms of generally similar conduct.  It wrote that both are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ejusdem generis,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the same kind, and that both are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98referable to the same subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  95 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 709.  Moreover, embezzlement requires a showing of wrongful intent.  Ibid. (noting that embezzlement \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[es] moral turpitude or intentional wrong\xe2\x80\x9d).  See Moore v. United States, \n\n160 U.\xc2\xa0S. 268\n\xe2\x80\x93270 (1895) (describing embezzlement and larceny as requiring \xe2\x80\x9cfelonious intent\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also, e.g., W. LaFave, Criminal Law \xc2\xa719.6(a), p. 995 (5th ed. 2010) (\xe2\x80\x9cintent to deprive\xe2\x80\x9d is part of embezzlement).  Hence, the Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d must require an equivalent showing.  Neal, supra, at 709.  Neal has been the law for more than a century.  And here, the additional neighbors (\xe2\x80\x9clarceny\xe2\x80\x9d and, as defined in Neal, \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d) mean that the canon noscitur a sociis argues even more strongly for similarly interpreting the similar statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, this interpretation does not make the word identical to its statutory neighbors.  See Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 687, \n698 (1995)\n (noting \xe2\x80\x9c[a] reluctance to treat statutory terms as surplusage\xe2\x80\x9d).  As commonly used, \xe2\x80\x9cembezzlement\xe2\x80\x9d requires conversion, and \xe2\x80\x9clarceny\xe2\x80\x9d requires taking and carrying away another\xe2\x80\x99s property.  See LaFave, Criminal Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa719.2, 19.5 (larceny); id., \xc2\xa719.6 (embezzlement).  \xe2\x80\x9cFraud\xe2\x80\x9d typically requires a false statement or omission.  See id., \xc2\xa719.7 (discussing fraud in the context of false pretenses).  \xe2\x80\x9cDefalcation,\xe2\x80\x9d as commonly used (hence as Congress might have understood it), can encompass a breach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conversion, nor taking and carrying away another\xe2\x80\x99s property, nor falsity.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 479.  See, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Frankel, 77 B.\xc2\xa0R. 401 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WDNY 1987) (finding a breach of fiduciary duty and defalcation based on an unreasonable sale of assets).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor are embezzlement, larceny, and fiduciary fraud simply special cases of defalcation as so defined.  The statutory provision makes clear that the first two terms apply outside of the fiduciary context; and \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation,\xe2\x80\x9d unlike \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d may be used to refer to nonfraudulent breaches of fiduciary duty.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 479.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the interpretation is consistent with the long-standing principle that \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions to discharge \xe2\x80\x98should be confined to those plainly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Kawaauhau v. Geiger, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 57, \n62 (1998)\n (quoting Gleason v. Thaw, \n\n236 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558, \n562 (1915)\n).  See Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n\n292 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234, \n244 (1934)\n; Neal, supra, at 709.  It is also consistent with a set of statutory exceptions that Congress normally confines to circumstances where strong, special policy considerations, such as the presence of fault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby benefiting, for example, a typically more honest creditor.  See, e.g., 11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), (a)(6), (a)(9) (fault).  See also, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7523(a)(1), (a)(7), (a)(14), (a)(14A) (taxes); \xc2\xa7523(a)(8) (educational loans); \xc2\xa7523(a)(15) (spousal and child support).  In the absence of fault, it is difficult to find strong policy reasons favoring a broader exception here, at least in respect to those whom a scienter requirement will most likely help, namely nonprofessional trustees, perhaps administering small family trusts potentially immersed in intrafamily arguments that are difficult to evaluate in terms of comparative fault.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, as far as the briefs before us reveal, at least some Circuits have interpreted the statute similarly for many years without administrative, or other practical, difficulties.  Baylis, 313 F.\xc2\xa03d 9.  See also In re Hyman, 502 F.\xc2\xa03d 61, 69 (CA2 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThis [scienter] standard .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. also has the virtue of ease of application since the courts and litigants have reference to a robust body of securities law examining what these terms mean\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, it is important to have a uniform interpreta- tion of federal law, the choices are limited, and neither the parties nor the Government has presented us with strong considerations favoring a different interpretation.  In addition to those we have already discussed, the Government has pointed to the fact that in 1970 Congress rewrote the statute, eliminating the word \xe2\x80\x9cmisappropriation\xe2\x80\x9d and placing the term \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d (previously in a different exemption provision) alongside its present three neighbors.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  The Government believes that these changes support reading \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation\xe2\x80\x9d without a scienter requirement.  But one might argue, with equal plausibility, that the changes reflect a decision to make certain that courts would read in similar ways \xe2\x80\x9cdefalcation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cembezzlement,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clarceny.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, we believe the 1970 changes are inconclusive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case the Court of Appeals applied a standard of \xe2\x80\x9cobjectiv[e] reckless[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d to facts presented at summary judgment.  670 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1166.  We consequently remand the case to permit the court to determine whether further proceedings are needed and, if so, to apply the heightened standard that we have set forth.  For these reasons we vacate the judgment of  the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
