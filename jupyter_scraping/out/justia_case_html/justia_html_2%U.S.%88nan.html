Words of mere heat and passion will not constitute the crime alledged; they are often uttered when the heart is properly disposed; and they must be construed according to their natural and common import, independent of the paraphrase of inuendos. It is true that the words, in the present instance, are exceptionable; but they manifest in themselves no intention, nor is there any proof of an intention, to persuade others to resist the Government; they merely express a matter of opinion; and cannot fairly be converted into matter of treason. Comb. 460. 4 Bl. C. 79. </p><p> Bradford, in reply. It is admitted, that the 4th section of the act of Assembly is inaccurately, and ungrammatically, composed; but the clause which has been the subject of comment, on the other side, has always been deemed a substantive and independent one. Let that clause, however, be rejected on account of its imperfections, there still remains abundant matter to support the indictment; for, the words being proved, are evidence on another clause, that the defendant \'maliciously and advisedly endeavoured to excite the people to resist the Government of this Commonwealth, and to persuade them to return to a dependence upon the Crown of Great Britain.\' </p><p> Again; it is agreed, that the words should be spoken maliciously and advisedly; but by malice the law only intends, that the speech be made in an evil and wicked temper of mind; and deliberation is so far essential, that the mere ebullition of a transient passion shall not be rigidly construed into design and criminality. </p><p> The Court delivered a charge to the following effect: </p><p></p><p> M\'Kean, Chief Justice: </p><p> This indictment charges all the various acts which constitute misprision of treason; and it is the duty of the Jury to enquire, whether the evidence supports any one of the charges. It is said, indeed, that the law on which the indictment is founded, is so inaccurately penned, that it cannot be understood without supplying certain material words; and it is, undoubtedly, true, that although, in a common case, on a mere question of property (as in the case of a Will) the rule of construction is according to the sense of the instrument; yet, a law constituting a crime, must be strictly and literally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 2 U.S. 88, 91</a></p><p> interpreted and pursued. The obscure passage in the Act of Assembly would be rendered perspicuous and intelligible, without the addition of any words, by expunging the femicolon, and the monosyllable \'or\': But even that is unnecessary to support the prosecution; since the words spoken tended to excite resistance to the Government of this Commonwealth, to persuade the audience to return to a dependence upon the Crown of Great Britain, and to favor the enemy; which are distinct and substantive charges of misprision of treason. </p><p> It is proper to add, that the words must be spoken with a malicious and mischievous intention, in order to render them criminal: A mere loofe and idle conversation, without any wickedness of heart, may be indiscreet and reprehensible, but ought not to be construed into misprision of treason. On the other hand, drunkenness is no justification, or excuse, for committing the offence; to allow it as such, would open a door for the practice of the greatest enormities with impunity. </p><p> Verdict, Guilty: </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] This cause was tried at a Session of Oyer &amp; Terminer, held at Lancaster, in November 1781.
