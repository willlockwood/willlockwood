S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1).  The authority to designate an entity a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x9d rests with the Secretary of State, and is subject to judicial review.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he term \xe2\x80\x98material support or resources\xe2\x80\x99 means any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1).  Over the years, \xc2\xa72339B and the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support or resources\xe2\x80\x9d have been amended, <em>inter alia,</em> to clarify that a violation requires knowledge of the foreign group\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a terrorist organization or its commission of terrorist acts, \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1); and to define the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339A(b)(2), \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339A(b)(3), and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339B(h).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the entities the Secretary of State has designated \xe2\x80\x9cforeign terrorist organization[s]\xe2\x80\x9d are the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan (PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which aim to establish independent states for, respectively, Kurds in Turkey and Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Although both groups engage in political and humanitarian activities, each has also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.  Claiming they wish to support those groups\xe2\x80\x99 lawful, nonviolent activities, two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations (hereinafter plaintiffs) initiated this constitutional challenge to the material-support statute.  The litigation has had a complicated 12-year history.  Ultimately, the District Court partially enjoined the enforcement of the material-support statute against plaintiffs.  After the Ninth Circuit affirmed, plaintiffs and the Government cross-petitioned for certiorari.  The Court granted both petitions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the litigation now stands, plaintiffs challenge \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on providing four types of material support\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94asserting violations of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause on the ground that the statutory terms are impermissibly vague, and violations of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They claim that \xc2\xa72339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in certain specified activities, including training PKK members to use international law to resolve disputes peacefully; teaching PKK members to petition the United Nations and other representative bodies for relief; and engaging in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.     </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The material-support statute, \xc2\xa72339B, is constitutional as applied to the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist organizations.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This preenforcement challenge to \xc2\xa72339B is a justiciable Article III case or controversy.  Plaintiffs face \xe2\x80\x9ca credible threat of prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Farm Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/289/index.html">442 U. S. 289</a>, 298.  P. 10. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation by accepting plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the material-support statute, when applied to speech, should be interpreted to require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s illegal activities.  That reading is inconsistent with \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s text, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d providing material support and demonstrates that Congress chose knowledge about the organization\xe2\x80\x99s connection to terrorism, not specific intent to further its terrorist activities, as the necessary mental state for a violation.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 reading is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding \xc2\xa72339B, which\xe2\x80\x94unlike \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x94do refer to intent to further terrorist activity.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72339A(a), 2339C(a)(1).  Finally, there is no textual basis for plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the same language in \xc2\xa72339B should be read to require specific intent with regard to speech, but not with regard to other forms of material support.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  The Ninth Circuit improperly merged plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding that \xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and a portion of \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d were impermissibly vague because they applied to protected speech\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether those applications were clear.  The Court of Appeals also contravened the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman Estates</em> v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/index.html">455 U. S. 489</a>, 495.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The material-support statute, in its application to plaintiffs, \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U. S. 285</a>, 304.  The statutory terms at issue here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are quite different from the sorts of terms, like \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98annoying\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98indecent,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court has struck down for requiring \xe2\x80\x9cwholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 306.  Congress has increased the clarity of \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s terms by adding narrowing definitions, and \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge requirement further reduces any potential for vagueness, see <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Colorado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/703/index.html">530 U. S. 703</a>, 732.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the statute may not be clear in every application, the dispositive point is that its terms are clear in their application to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed conduct.  Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage readily fall within the scope of \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used those terms to describe their own proposed activities.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 resort to hypothetical situations testing the limits of \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d is beside the point because this litigation does not concern such situations.  See <em>Scales</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/203/index.html">367 U. S. 203</a>, 223.  <em>Gentile</em> v. <em>State Bar of Nev.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/1030/index.html">501 U. S. 1030</a>, 1049\xe2\x80\x931051, distinguished.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 further contention, that the statute is vague in its application to the political advocacy they wish to undertake, runs afoul of \xc2\xa72339B(h), which makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d does not cover advocacy by those acting entirely independently of a foreign terrorist organization, and the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d which refers to concerted activity, not independent advocacy.  Context confirms that meaning: Independently advocating for a cause is different from the prohibited act of providing a service \xe2\x80\x9cto a foreign terrorist organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage is not prohibited by \xc2\xa72339B.  On the other hand, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to cover advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.  Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the degree to which <em>they</em> seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE, however, they cannot prevail in their preenforcement challenge. See <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html">552 U. S. 442</a>, 454.  Pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9320. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0As applied to plaintiffs, the material-support statute does not violate the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Pp. 20\xe2\x80\x9334.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question.  Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their pure political speech.  That claim is unfounded because, under the material-support statute, they may say anything they wish on any topic.  Section 2339B does not prohibit independent advocacy or membership in the PKK and LTTE.  Rather, Congress has prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support,\xe2\x80\x9d which most often does not take the form of speech.  And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.  On the other hand, the Government errs in arguing that the only thing actually at issue here is conduct, not speech, and that the correct standard of review is intermediate scrutiny, as set out in <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U. S. 367</a>, 377.  That standard is not used to review a content-based regulation of speech, and \xc2\xa72339B regulates plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 speech to the PKK and the LTTE on the basis of its content.  Even if the material-support statute generally functions as a regulation of conduct, as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.    Thus, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cmust [apply] a more demanding standard\xe2\x80\x9d than the one described in <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>.  <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/397/index.html">491 U. S. 397</a>, 403.  Pp. 20\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The parties agree that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order, but plaintiffs argue that this objective does not justify prohibiting their speech, which they say will advance only the legitimate activities of the PKK and LTTE.  Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question.  Congress rejected plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 position on that question when it enacted \xc2\xa72339B, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cforeign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(a), 110 Stat. 1247, note following \xc2\xa72339B.  The record confirms that Congress was justified in rejecting plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 view.  The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.  It is not difficult to conclude, as Congress did, that the taint of their violent activities is so great that working in coordination with them or at their command legitimizes and furthers their terrorist means.  Moreover, material support meant to promote peaceable, lawful conduct can be diverted to advance terrorism in multiple ways.  The record shows that designated foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational firewalls between social, political, and terrorist operations, or financial firewalls between funds raised for humanitarian activities and those used to carry out terrorist attacks.  Providing material support in any form would also undermine cooperative international efforts to prevent terrorism and strain the United States\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with its allies, including those that are defending themselves against violent insurgencies waged by foreign terrorist groups.  Pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9328. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The Court does not rely exclusively on its own factual inferences drawn from the record evidence, but considers the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s stated view that the experience and analysis of Government agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly support Congress\xe2\x80\x99s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations\xe2\x80\x94even those for seemingly benign purposes\xe2\x80\x94further those groups\xe2\x80\x99 terrorist activities.  That evaluation of the facts, like Congress\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, is entitled to deference, given the sensitive national security and foreign relations interests at stake.  The Court does not defer to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the First Amendment.  But respect for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s factual conclusions is appropriate in light of the courts\xe2\x80\x99 lack of expertise with respect to national security and foreign affairs, and the reality that efforts to confront terrorist threats occur in an area where information can be difficult to obtain, the impact of certain conduct can be difficult to assess, and conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than concrete evidence.  The Court also finds it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.  Most importantly, Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.  Given the sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately substantiated their determination that prohibiting material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign terrorist groups serves the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing terrorism, even if those providing the support mean to promote only the groups\xe2\x80\x99 nonviolent ends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake, it is wholly foreseeable that directly training the PKK on how to use international law to resolve disputes would provide that group with information and techniques that it could use as part of a broader strategy to promote terrorism, and to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.  Teaching the PKK to petition international bodies for relief also could help the PKK obtain funding it would redirect to its violent activities.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposals to engage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds and Tamils, in turn, are phrased so generally that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.  The Court does not decide whether any future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny.  It simply holds that \xc2\xa72339B does not violate the freedom of speech as applied to the particular types of support these plaintiffs seek to provide.  Pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Nor does the material-support statute violate plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment freedom of association.  Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE, and thereby runs afoul of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected this claim because \xc2\xa72339B does not penalize mere association, but prohibits the act of giving foreign terrorist groups material support.  Any burden on plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of association caused by preventing them from supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations, but not other groups, is justified for the same reasons the Court rejects their free speech challenge.

Circuit within 30 days of that designation.  \xc2\xa71189(c)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, the Secretary of State designated 30 groups as foreign terrorist organizations.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 52650.  Two of those groups are the Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party (also known as the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan, or PKK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).  The PKK is an organization founded in 1974 with the aim of establishing an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.  <em>Humanitarian Law Project</em> v. <em>Reno</em>, 9 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1176, 1180\xe2\x80\x931181 (CD Cal. 1998); Brief for Petitioners in No. 08\xe2\x80\x931498, p.\xc2\xa06 (hereinafter Brief for Government).  The LTTE is an organization founded in 1976 for the purpose of creating an independent Tamil state in Sri Lanka.  9 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1182; Brief for Government 6.  The District Court in this action found that the PKK and the LTTE engage in political and humanitarian activities.  See 9 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1180\xe2\x80\x931182.  The Government has presented evidence that both groups have also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have harmed American citizens.  See App. 128\xe2\x80\x93133.  The LTTE sought judicial review of its designation as a foreign terrorist organization; the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit upheld that designation.  See <em>People\xe2\x80\x99s Mojahedin Organization of Iran</em> v. <em>Dept. of State</em>, 182 F.\xc2\xa03d 17, 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 25 (1999).  The PKK did not challenge its designation.  9 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1180.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs in this litigation are two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations: the Humanitarian Law Project (HLP) (a human rights organization with consultative status to the United Nations); Ralph Fertig (the HLP\xe2\x80\x99s president, and a retired administrative law judge); Nagalingam Jeyalingam (a Tamil physician, born in Sri Lanka and a naturalized U. S. citizen); and five nonprofit groups dedicated to the interests of persons of Tamil descent.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 09\xe2\x80\x9389, pp. ii, 10 (hereinafter Brief for Plaintiffs); App. 48.  In 1998, plaintiffs filed suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the material-support statute, \xc2\xa72339B.  Plaintiffs claimed that they wished to provide support for the humanitarian and political activities of the PKK and the LTTE in the form of monetary contributions, other tangible aid, legal training, and political advocacy, but that they could not do so for fear of prosecution under \xc2\xa72339B.  9 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1180\xe2\x80\x931184.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As relevant here, plaintiffs claimed that the material-support statute was unconstitutional on two grounds: First, it violated their freedom of speech and freedom of association under the First Amendment, because it criminalized their provision of material support to the PKK and the LTTE, without requiring the Government to prove that plaintiffs had a specific intent to further the unlawful ends of those organizations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1184.  Second, plaintiffs argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1184\xe2\x80\x931185.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which the District Court granted in part.  The District Court held that plaintiffs had not established a probability of success on their First Amendment speech and association claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1196\xe2\x80\x931197.  But the court held that plaintiffs had established a probability of success on their claim that, as applied to them, the statutory terms \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d were impermissibly vague.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1204.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  205 F.\xc2\xa03d 1130, 1138 (CA9 2000).  The court rejected plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 speech and association claims, including their claim that \xc2\xa72339B violated the First Amendment in barring them from contributing money to the PKK and the LTTE.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1133\xe2\x80\x931136.  But the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d were vague because it was \xe2\x80\x9ceasy to imagine protected expression that falls within the bounds\xe2\x80\x9d of those terms.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1138; see <em>id.</em>, at 1137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the preliminary injunction issue decided, the action returned to the District Court, and the parties moved for summary judgment on the merits.  The District Court entered a permanent injunction against applying to plaintiffs the bans on \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d support.  See No. CV\xe2\x80\x9398\xe2\x80\x931971 ABC (BQRx), 2001 WL 36105333 (CD Cal., Oct. 2, 2001).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  352 F.\xc2\xa03d 382 (CA9 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, in 2001, Congress amended the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support or resources\xe2\x80\x9d to add the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), \xc2\xa7805(a)(2)(B), 115 Stat. 377.  In 2003, plaintiffs filed a second action challenging the constitutionality of that term as applied to them.  309 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1185, 1192 (CD Cal. 2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In that action, the Government argued that plaintiffs lacked standing and that their preenforcement claims were not ripe.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1194.  The District Court held that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims were justiciable because plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated a \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine threat of imminent prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 1195 (internal quotation marks omitted), and because \xc2\xa72339B had the potential to chill plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 protected expression, see <em>id.</em>, at 1197\xe2\x80\x931198.  On the merits, the District Court held that the term \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d was impermissibly vague.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1201.  The District Court rejected, however, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment claims that the new term was substantially overbroad and criminalized associational speech.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1202, 1203.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties cross-appealed.  While the cross-appeals were pending, the Ninth Circuit granted en banc rehearing of the panel\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 decision in plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 first action (involving the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d).  See 382 F.\xc2\xa03d 1154, 1155 (2004).  The en banc court heard reargument on December 14, 2004.  See 380 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1134, 1138 (CD Cal. 2005).  Three days later, Congress again amended \xc2\xa72339B and the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support or resources.\xe2\x80\x9d  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), \xc2\xa76603, 118 Stat. 3762\xe2\x80\x933764.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary to violate \xc2\xa72339B, requiring knowledge of the foreign group\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a terrorist organization or the group\xe2\x80\x99s commission of terrorist acts.  \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1).  Congress also added the term \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support or resources,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1), and defined \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cinstruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339A(b)(2).  It also defined \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cadvice or assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339A(b)(3).  Finally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d by providing:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNo person may be prosecuted under [\xc2\xa72339B] in connection with the term \xe2\x80\x98personnel\xe2\x80\x99 unless that person has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or conspired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with 1 or more individuals (who may be or include himself) to work under that terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s direction or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the operation of that organization.  Individuals who act entirely independently of the foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or objectives shall not be considered to be working under the foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s direction and control.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(h).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after Congress enacted IRTPA, the en banc Court of Appeals issued an order in plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 first action.  393 F.\xc2\xa03d 902, 903 (CA9 2004).  The en banc court affirmed the rejection of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment claims for the reasons set out in the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s panel decision in 2000.  See <em>ibid.</em>  In light of IRTPA, however, the en banc court vacated the panel\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 judgment with respect to vagueness, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Ninth Circuit panel assigned to the cross-appeals in plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 second action (relating to \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d) also remanded in light of IRTPA.  See 380 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1139.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court consolidated the two actions on remand.  See <em>ibid.</em>  The court also allowed plaintiffs to challenge the new term \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.</em>, at 1151, n. 24.  The parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted partial relief to plaintiffs on vagueness grounds.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1156.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed once more.  552 F.\xc2\xa03d 916, 933 (CA9 2009).  The court first rejected plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the material-support statute would violate due process unless it were read to require a specific intent to further the illegal ends of a foreign terrorist organization.  See <em>id.</em>, at 926\xe2\x80\x93927.  The Ninth Circuit also held that the statute was not overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 931\xe2\x80\x93932.  As for vagueness, the Court of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had not raised a \xe2\x80\x9cfacial vagueness challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 929, n.\xc2\xa06.  The court held that, as applied to plaintiffs, the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d (when derived from \xe2\x80\x9cother specialized knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d), and \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d were vague because they \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue[d] to cover constitutionally protected advocacy,\xe2\x80\x9d but the term \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d was not vague because it \xe2\x80\x9cno longer criminalize[d] pure speech protected by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 929\xe2\x80\x93931.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs filed a conditional cross-petition.  We granted both petitions.  557 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation, we pause to clarify the questions before us.  Plaintiffs challenge \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on four types of material support\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  They raise three constitutional claims.  First, plaintiffs claim that \xc2\xa72339B violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these four statutory terms are impermissibly vague.  Second, plaintiffs claim that \xc2\xa72339B violates their freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  Third, plaintiffs claim that \xc2\xa72339B violates their First Amendment freedom of association.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in all their applications.  Rather, plaintiffs claim that \xc2\xa72339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them from engaging in certain specified activities.  See Brief for Plaintiffs 16\xe2\x80\x9317, n.\xc2\xa010.  With respect to the HLP and Judge Fertig, those activities are: (1) \xe2\x80\x9ctrain[ing] members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cengag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cteach[ing] PKK members how to petition various representative bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01; see 380 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1136.  With respect to the other plaintiffs, those activities are: (1) \xe2\x80\x9ctrain[ing] members of [the] LTTE to present claims for tsunami-related aid to mediators and international bodies\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9coffer[ing] their legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cengag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri Lanka.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01; see 380 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1137.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also state that \xe2\x80\x9cthe LTTE was recently defeated militarily in Sri Lanka,\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9c[m]uch of the support the Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam sought to provide is now moot.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Plaintiffs 11, n.\xc2\xa05.  Plaintiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE \xe2\x80\x9cas a political organization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of Tamils.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at oral argument that plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the LTTE how to present claims for tsunami-related aid, because the LTTE now \xe2\x80\x9chas no role in Sri Lanka.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 63.  For that reason, helping the LTTE negotiate a peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be moot as well.  Thus, we do not consider the application of \xc2\xa72339B to those activities here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One last point.  Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of a criminal statute.  Before addressing the merits, we must be sure that this is a justiciable case or controversy under Article III.  We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face \xe2\x80\x9ca credible threat of prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Farm Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/289/index.html">442 U. S. 289</a>, 298 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also <em>MedImmune, Inc.</em> v. <em>Genentech, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/118/index.html">549 U. S. 118</a>, 128\xe2\x80\x93129 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs claim that they provided support to the PKK and the LTTE before the enactment of \xc2\xa72339B and that they would provide similar support again if the statute\xe2\x80\x99s allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted.  See 309 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1197.  The Government tells us that it has charged about 150 persons with violating \xc2\xa72339B, and that several of those prosecutions involved the enforcement of the statutory terms at issue here.  See Brief for Government 5.  The Government has not argued to this Court that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what they say they wish to do.  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  See <em>Babbitt</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 302.  See also <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.\xc2\xa0A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4, 19) (considering an as-applied preenforcement challenge brought under the First Amendment).  Based on these considerations, we conclude that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims are suitable for judicial review (as one might hope after 12 years of litigation).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should affirm the Court of Appeals without reaching any issues of constitutional law.  They contend that we should interpret the material-support statute, when applied to speech, to require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s illegal activities.  That interpretation, they say, would end the litigation because plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs do not intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the LTTE.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa72339B because it is inconsistent with the text of the statute.  Section 2339B(a)(1) prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly\xe2\x80\x9d providing material support.  It then specifically describes the type of knowledge that is required: \xe2\x80\x9cTo violate this paragraph, a person must have knowledge that the organization is a designated terrorist organization . . ., that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity \xe2\x80\xa6, or that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Congress plainly spoke to the necessary mental state for a violation of \xc2\xa72339B, and it chose knowledge about the organization\xe2\x80\x99s connection to terrorism, not specific intent to further the organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation is also untenable in light of the sections immediately surrounding \xc2\xa72339B, both of which do refer to intent to further terrorist activity.  See \xc2\xa72339A(a) (establishing criminal penalties for one who \xe2\x80\x9cprovides material support or resources . . . knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, a violation of\xe2\x80\x9d statutes prohibiting violent terrorist acts); \xc2\xa72339C(a)(1) (setting criminal penalties for one who \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully and willfully provides or collects funds with the intention that such funds be used, or with the knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out\xe2\x80\x9d other unlawful acts).  Congress enacted \xc2\xa72339A in 1994 and \xc2\xa72339C in 2002.  See \xc2\xa7120005(a), 108 Stat. 2022 (\xc2\xa72339A); \xc2\xa7202(a), 116 Stat. 724 (\xc2\xa72339C).  Yet Congress did not import the intent language of those provisions into \xc2\xa72339B, either when it enacted \xc2\xa72339B in 1996, or when it clarified \xc2\xa72339B\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge requirement in 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue that a specific intent requirement should apply only when the material-support statute applies to speech.  There is no basis whatever in the text of \xc2\xa72339B to read the same provisions in that statute as requiring intent in some circumstances but not others.  It is therefore clear that plaintiffs are asking us not to interpret \xc2\xa72339B, but to revise it.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough this Court will often strain to construe legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting the purpose of a statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scales</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/203/index.html">367 U. S. 203</a>, 211 (1961).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Scales</em> is the case on which plaintiffs most heavily rely, but it is readily distinguishable.  That case involved the Smith Act, which prohibited membership in a group advocating the violent overthrow of the government.  The Court held that a person could not be convicted under the statute unless he had knowledge of the group\xe2\x80\x99s illegal advocacy and a specific intent to bring about violent overthrow.  <em>Id.</em>, at 220\xe2\x80\x93222, 229.  This action is different: Section 2339B does not criminalize mere membership in a designated foreign terrorist organization.  It instead prohibits providing \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d to such a group.  See <em>infra</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321, 35.  Nothing about <em>Scales</em> suggests the need for a specific intent requirement in such a case.  The Court in <em>Scales</em>, moreover, relied on both statutory text and precedent that had interpreted closely related provisions of the Smith Act to require specific intent.  367 U. S., at 209, 221\xe2\x80\x93222.  Plaintiffs point to nothing similar here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation through plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed interpretation of \xc2\xa72339B.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the question whether the material-support statute, as applied to plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  \xe2\x80\x9cA conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U.

We consider whether a statute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman Estates</em> v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/489/index.html">455 U. S. 489</a>, 495 (1982).  We have said that when a statute \xe2\x80\x9cinterferes with the right of free speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 499.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut \xe2\x80\x98perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 304 (quoting <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Rock Against Racism</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/781/index.html">491 U. S. 781</a>, 794 (1989)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles.  Instead, the lower court merged plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims, holding that portions of the material-support statute were unconstitutionally vague because they applied to protected speech\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether those applications were clear.  The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary intelligence understood the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d that term would \xe2\x80\x9cremai[n] impermissibly vague\xe2\x80\x9d because it could \xe2\x80\x9cbe read to encompass speech and advocacy protected by the First Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 929.  It also found \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d and a portion of \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d to be vague because those terms covered protected speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 929\xe2\x80\x93930.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, in spite of its own statement that it was not addressing a \xe2\x80\x9cfacial vagueness challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 929, n.\xc2\xa06, the Court of Appeals considered the statute\xe2\x80\x99s application to facts not before it.  Specifically, the Ninth Circuit relied on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xc2\xa72339B would bar filing an <em>amicus</em> brief in support of a foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x94which plaintiffs have not told us they wish to do, and which the Ninth Circuit did not say plaintiffs wished to do\xe2\x80\x94to conclude that the statute barred protected advocacy and was therefore vague.  See <em>id.</em>, at 930.  By deciding how the statute applied in hypothetical circumstances, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 discussion of vagueness seemed to incorporate elements of First Amendment overbreadth doctrine.  See <em>id.</em>, at 929\xe2\x80\x93930 (finding it \xe2\x80\x9ceasy to imagine\xe2\x80\x9d protected expression that would be barred by \xc2\xa72339B (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>id.</em>, at 930 (referring to both vagueness and overbreadth).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In both of these respects, the Court of Appeals contravened the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hoffman Estates</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 495.  That rule makes no exception for conduct in the form of speech.  See <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Levy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/733/index.html">417 U. S. 733</a>, 755\xe2\x80\x93757 (1974).  Thus, even to the extent a heightened vagueness standard applies, a plaintiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a successful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment for lack of notice.  And he certainly cannot do so based on the speech of others.  Such a plaintiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the First Amendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth Amendment vagueness challenge does not turn on whether a law applies to a substantial amount of protected expression.  See <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 304; <em>Hoffman Estates</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 494\xe2\x80\x93495, 497.  Otherwise the doctrines would be substantially redundant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims of vagueness lack merit.  Plaintiffs do not argue that the material-support statute grants too much enforcement discretion to the Government.  We therefore address only whether the statute \xe2\x80\x9cprovide[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 553 U. S., at 304.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a general matter, the statutory terms at issue here are quite different from the sorts of terms that we have previously declared to be vague.  We have in the past \xe2\x80\x9cstruck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was \xe2\x80\x98annoying\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98indecent\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context, or settled legal meanings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 306; see also <em>Papachristou</em> v. <em>Jacksonville</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/156/index.html">405 U. S. 156</a>, n.\xc2\xa01 (1972) (holding vague an ordinance that punished \xe2\x80\x9cvagrants,\xe2\x80\x9d defined to include \xe2\x80\x9crogues and vagabonds,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpersons who use juggling,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommon night walkers\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Applying the statutory terms in this action\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94does not require similarly untethered, subjective judgments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress also took care to add narrowing definitions to the material-support statute over time.  These definitions increased the clarity of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s terms.  See \xc2\xa72339A(b)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98training\xe2\x80\x99 means instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72339A(b)(3) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x99 means advice or assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72339B(h) (clarifying the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the knowledge requirement of the statute further reduces any potential for vagueness, as we have held with respect to other statutes containing a similar requirement.  See <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Colorado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/703/index.html">530 U. S. 703</a>, 732 (2000); <em>Posters \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 Things, Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/513/index.html">511 U. S. 513</a>, 523, 526 (1994); see also <em>Hoffman Estates</em>, 455 U. S., at 499.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the scope of the material-support statute may not be clear in every application.  But the dispositive point here is that the statutory terms are clear in their application to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed conduct, which means that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 vagueness challenge must fail.  Even assuming that a heightened standard applies because the material-support statute potentially implicates speech, the statutory terms are not vague as applied to plaintiffs.  See <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html">408 U. S. 104</a>, 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (1972) (rejecting a vagueness challenge to a criminal law that implicated First Amendment activities); <em>Scales</em>, 367 U. S., at 223 (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most of the activities in which plaintiffs seek to engage readily fall within the scope of the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Plaintiffs want to \xe2\x80\x9ctrain members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cteach PKK members how to petition various representative bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01.  A person of ordinary intelligence would understand that instruction on resolving disputes through international law falls within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d because it imparts a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific skill,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339A(b)(2).  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 activities also fall comfortably within the scope of \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance\xe2\x80\x9d: A reasonable person would recognize that teaching the PKK how to petition for humanitarian relief before the United Nations involves advice derived from, as the statute puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339A(b)(3).  In fact, plaintiffs themselves have repeatedly used the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice\xe2\x80\x9d throughout this litigation to describe their own proposed activities, demonstrating that these common terms readily and naturally cover plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Plaintiffs 10, 11; App. 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81, 98, 99, 106, 107, 117.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs respond by pointing to hypothetical situations designed to test the limits of \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  They argue that the statutory definitions of these terms use words of degree\xe2\x80\x94like \xe2\x80\x9cspecific,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that it is difficult to apply those definitions in particular cases.  See Brief for Plaintiffs 27 (debating whether teaching a course on geography would constitute training); <em>id.</em>, at 29.  And they cite <em>Gentile</em> v. <em>State Bar of Nev.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/1030/index.html">501 U. S. 1030</a> (1991), in which we found vague a state bar rule providing that a lawyer in a criminal case, when speaking to the press, \xe2\x80\x9cmay state without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1048 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever force these arguments might have in the abstract, they are beside the point here.  Plaintiffs do not propose to teach a course on geography, and cannot seek refuge in imaginary cases that straddle the boundary between \xe2\x80\x9cspecific skills\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Levy</em>, 417 U. S., at 756.  We emphasized this point in <em>Scales</em>, holding that even if there might be theoretical doubts regarding the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d membership in an organization\xe2\x80\x94also terms of degree\xe2\x80\x94the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness challenge failed because his \xe2\x80\x9ccase present[ed] no such problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  367 U. S., at 223.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gentile</em> was different.  There the asserted vagueness in a state bar rule was directly implicated by the facts before the Court: Counsel had reason to suppose that his particular statements to the press would not violate the rule, yet he was disciplined nonetheless.  See 501 U. S., at 1049\xe2\x80\x931051.  We did not suggest that counsel could escape discipline on vagueness grounds if his own speech were plainly prohibited.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also contend that they want to engage in \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d on behalf of Kurds living in Turkey and Tamils living in Sri Lanka.  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01.  They are concerned that such advocacy might be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of providing \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cservice[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and assert that the statute is unconstitutionally vague because they cannot tell.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress enacted a limiting definition in IRTPA that answers plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 vagueness concerns.  Providing material support that constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as knowingly providing a person \xe2\x80\x9cto work under that terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s direction or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the operation of that organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(h).  The statute makes clear that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d does not cover <em>independent</em> advocacy: \xe2\x80\x9cIndividuals who act entirely independently of the foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or objectives shall not be considered to be working under the foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s direction and control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ervice\xe2\x80\x9d similarly refers to concerted activity, not independent advocacy.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2075 (1993) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe performance of work commanded or paid for by another: a servant\xe2\x80\x99s duty: attendance on a superior\xe2\x80\x9d; or \xe2\x80\x9can act done for the benefit or at the command of another\xe2\x80\x9d).  Context confirms that ordinary meaning here.  The statute prohibits providing a service \xe2\x80\x9c<em>to</em> a foreign terrorist organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d indicates a connection between the service and the foreign group.  We think a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that independently advocating for a cause is different from providing a service to a group that is advocating for that cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, if independent activity in support of a terrorist group could be characterized as a \xe2\x80\x9cservice,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute\xe2\x80\x99s specific exclusion of independent activity in the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel\xe2\x80\x9d would not make sense.  Congress would not have prohibited under \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d what it specifically exempted from prohibition under \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel.\xe2\x80\x9d  The other types of material support listed in the statute, including \xe2\x80\x9clodging,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cweapons,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexplosives,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1), are not forms of support that could be provided independently of a foreign terrorist organization.  We interpret \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d along the same lines.  Thus, any independent advocacy in which plaintiffs wish to engage is not prohibited by \xc2\xa72339B.  On the other hand, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term \xe2\x80\x9cservice\xe2\x80\x9d to cover advocacy performed in coordination with, or at the direction of, a foreign terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs argue that this construction of the statute poses difficult questions of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to constitute a \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 09\xe2\x80\x9389, p.\xc2\xa014 (hereinafter Reply Brief for Plaintiffs) (\xe2\x80\x9cWould any communication with any member be sufficient?  With a leader?  Must the \xe2\x80\x98relationship\xe2\x80\x99 have any formal elements, such as an employment or contractual relationship?  What about a relationship through an intermediary?\xe2\x80\x9d).  The problem with these questions is that they are entirely hypothetical.  Plaintiffs have not provided any specific articulation of the degree to which <em>they</em> seek to coordinate their advocacy with the PKK and the LTTE.  They have instead described the form of their intended advocacy only in the most general terms.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Brief for Plaintiffs 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cwould like, among other things, to offer their services to advocate on behalf of the rights of the Kurdish people and the PKK before the United Nations and the United States Congress\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); App. 59 (plaintiffs would like to \xe2\x80\x9cwrite and distribute publications supportive of the PKK and the cause of Kurdish liberation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadvocate for the freedom of political prisoners in Turkey\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deciding whether activities described at such a level of generality would constitute prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cservice[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute would require \xe2\x80\x9csheer speculation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which means that plaintiffs cannot prevail in their preenforcement challenge.  See <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/442/index.html">552 U. S. 442</a>, 454 (2008).  It is apparent with respect to these claims that \xe2\x80\x9cgradations of fact or charge would make a difference as to criminal liability,\xe2\x80\x9d and so \xe2\x80\x9cadjudication of the reach and constitutionality of [the statute] must await a concrete fact situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zemel</em> v. <em>Rusk</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/1/index.html">381 U.

Both plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question.  Plaintiffs claim that Congress has banned their \xe2\x80\x9cpure political speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.,</em> Brief for Plaintiffs 2, 25, 43.  It has not.  Under the material-support statute, plaintiffs may say anything they wish on any topic.  They may speak and write freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of Turkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international law.  They may advocate before the United Nations.  As the Government states: \xe2\x80\x9cThe statute does not prohibit independent advocacy or expression of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Government 13.  Section 2339B also \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not prevent [plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE or impose any sanction on them for doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60.  Congress has not, therefore, sought to suppress ideas or opinions in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cpure political speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, Congress has prohibited \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support,\xe2\x80\x9d which most often does not take the form of speech at all.  And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far, claiming that the only thing truly at issue in this litigation is conduct, not speech.  Section 2339B is directed at the fact of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the Government contends, and only incidentally burdens their expression.  The Government argues that the proper standard of review is therefore the one set out in <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/367/index.html">391 U. S. 367</a> (1968).  In that case, the Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to a conviction under a generally applicable prohibition on destroying draft cards, even though O\xe2\x80\x99Brien had burned his card in protest against the draft.  See <em>id.</em>, at 370, 376, 382.  In so doing, we applied what we have since called \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d under which a \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-neutral regulation will be sustained under the First Amendment if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/180/index.html">520 U. S. 180</a>, 189 (1997) (citing <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 377).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation is conduct, and therefore wrong to argue that <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em> provides the correct standard of review.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em> does not provide the applicable standard for reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see <em>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</em> v. <em>St. Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/377/index.html">505 U.

S. 397</a>, 403, 406\xe2\x80\x93407 (1989), and \xc2\xa72339B regulates speech on the basis of its content.  Plaintiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether they may do so under \xc2\xa72339B depends on what they say.  If plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 speech to those groups imparts a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific skill\xe2\x80\x9d or communicates advice derived from \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the United Nations\xe2\x80\x94then it is barred.  See Brief for Government 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  On the other hand, plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized knowledge.  See <em>id.</em>, at 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that \xc2\xa72339B should nonetheless receive intermediate scrutiny because it <em>generally</em> functions as a regulation of conduct.  That argument runs headlong into a number of our precedents, most prominently <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/15/index.html">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971).  <em>Cohen </em>also involved a generally applicable regulation of conduct, barring breaches of the peace.  See <em>id.</em>, at 16.  But when Cohen was convicted for wearing a jacket bearing an epithet, we did not apply <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>.  See 403 U. S., at 16, 18.  Instead, we recognized that the generally applicable law was directed at Cohen because of what his speech communicated\xe2\x80\x94he violated the breach of the peace statute because of the offensive content of his particular message.  We accordingly applied more rigorous scrutiny and reversed his conviction.  See <em>id.</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, 26.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This suit falls into the same category.  The law here may be described as directed at conduct, as the law in <em>Cohen</em> was directed at breaches of the peace, but as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute consists of communicating a message.  As we explained in <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the [Government\xe2\x80\x99s] regulation is not related to expression, then the less stringent standard we announced in <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien </em>for regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls.  If it is, then we are outside of <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test, and we must [apply] a more demanding standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  491 U. S., at 403 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment issue before us is more refined than either plaintiffs or the Government would have it.  It is not whether the Government may prohibit pure political speech, or may prohibit material support in the form of conduct.  It is instead whether the Government may prohibit what plaintiffs want to do\xe2\x80\x94provide material support to the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Everyone agrees that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order.  See Brief for Plaintiffs 51.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint is that the ban on material support, applied to what they wish to do, is not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary to further that interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The objective of combating terrorism does not justify prohibiting their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their support will advance only the legitimate activities of the designated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.  <em>Id.</em>, at 51\xe2\x80\x9352.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question.  When it enacted \xc2\xa72339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings regarding the serious threat posed by international terrorism.  See AEDPA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7301(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72339B (Findings and Purpose).  One of those findings explicitly rejects plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 contention that their support would not further the terrorist activities of the PKK and LTTE: \xe2\x80\x9c[F]oreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that <em>any contribution to such an organization</em> facilitates that conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(a)(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs argue that the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cany contribution\xe2\x80\x9d in this finding meant only monetary support.  There is no reason to read the finding to be so limited, particularly because Congress expressly prohibited so much more than monetary support in \xc2\xa72339B.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution\xe2\x80\x9d is best read to reflect a determination that any form of material support furnished \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign terrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely what the material-support statute does.  Indeed, when Congress enacted \xc2\xa72339B, Congress simultaneously removed an exception that had existed in \xc2\xa72339A(a) (1994 ed.) for the provision of material support in the form of \xe2\x80\x9chumanitarian assistance to persons not directly involved in\xe2\x80\x9d terrorist activity.  AEDPA \xc2\xa7323, 110 Stat. 1255; 205 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1136.  That repeal demonstrates that Congress considered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful aid would have no harmful effects.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are convinced that Congress was justified in rejecting that view.  The PKK and the LTTE are deadly groups.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe PKK\xe2\x80\x99s insurgency has claimed more than 22,000 lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 128, \xc2\xb65.  The LTTE has engaged in extensive suicide bombings and political assassinations, including killings of the Sri Lankan President, Security Minister, and Deputy Defense Minister.  <em>Id.</em>, at 130\xe2\x80\x93132; Brief for Government 6\xe2\x80\x937.  \xe2\x80\x9cOn January 31, 1996, the LTTE exploded a truck bomb filled with an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at the Central Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring more than 1,400.  This bombing was the most deadly terrorist incident in the world in 1996.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 131, \xc2\xb66.h.  It is not difficult to conclude as Congress did that the \xe2\x80\x9ctain[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of such violent activities is so great that working in coordination with or at the command of the PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and further their terrorist means.  AEDPA \xc2\xa7301(a)(7), 110 Stat. 1247.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Material support meant to \xe2\x80\x9cpromot[e] peaceable, lawful conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Plaintiffs 51, can further terrorism by foreign groups in multiple ways.  \xe2\x80\x9cMaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d is a valuable resource by definition.  Such support frees up other resources within the organization that may be put to violent ends.  It also importantly helps lend legitimacy to foreign terrorist groups\xe2\x80\x94legitimacy that makes it easier for those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds\xe2\x80\x94all of which facilitate more terrorist attacks.  \xe2\x80\x9cTerrorist organizations do not maintain <em>organizational</em> \xe2\x80\x98firewalls\xe2\x80\x99 that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and commingling of support and benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 135, \xc2\xb611.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]nvestigators have revealed how terrorist groups systematically conceal their activities behind charitable, social, and political fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Levitt, Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad 2\xe2\x80\x933 (2006).  \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, some designated foreign terrorist organizations use social and political components to recruit personnel to carry out terrorist operations, and to provide support to criminal terrorists and their families in aid of such operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 135, \xc2\xb611; Levitt, <em>supra</em>, at 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cMuddying the waters between its political activism, good works, and terrorist attacks, Hamas is able to use its overt political and charitable organizations as a financial and logistical support network for its terrorist operations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Money is fungible, and \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen foreign terrorist organizations that have a dual structure raise funds, they highlight the civilian and humanitarian ends to which such moneys could be put.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 134, \xc2\xb69.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthere is reason to believe that foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain legitimate <em>financial</em> firewalls between those funds raised for civil, nonviolent activities, and those ultimately used to support violent, terrorist operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 135, \xc2\xb612.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[f]unds raised ostensibly for charitable purposes have in the past been redirected by some terrorist groups to fund the purchase of arms and explosives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 134, \xc2\xb610.  See also Brief for Anti-Defamation League as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 19\xe2\x80\x9329 (describing fundraising activities by the PKK, LTTE, and Hamas); <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Wald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/222/index.html">468 U.

There is evidence that the PKK and the LTTE, in particular, have not \xe2\x80\x9crespected the line between humanitarian and violent activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 135, \xc2\xb613 (discussing PKK); see <em>id.</em>, at 134 (LTTE).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno natural stopping place\xe2\x80\x9d for the proposition that aiding a foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s lawful activity promotes the terrorist organization as a whole.  <em>Post</em>, at 10.  But Congress has settled on just such a natural stopping place: The statute reaches only material support coordinated with or under the direction of a designated foreign terrorist organization.  Independent advocacy that might be viewed as promoting the group\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy is not covered.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9321.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Providing foreign terrorist groups with material support in any form also furthers terrorism by straining the United States\xe2\x80\x99 relationships with its allies and undermining cooperative efforts between nations to prevent terrorist attacks.  We see no reason to question Congress\xe2\x80\x99s finding that \xe2\x80\x9cinternational cooperation is required for an effective response to terrorism, as demonstrated by the numerous multilateral conventions in force providing universal prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in a variety of terrorist acts, including hostage taking, murder of an internationally protected person, and aircraft piracy and sabotage.\xe2\x80\x9d  AEDPA \xc2\xa7301(a)(5), 110 Stat. 1247, note following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72339B (Findings and Purpose).  The material-support statute furthers this international effort by prohibiting aid for foreign terrorist groups that harm the United States\xe2\x80\x99 partners abroad: \xe2\x80\x9cA number of designated foreign terrorist organizations have attacked moderate governments with which the United States has vigorously endeavored to maintain close and friendly relations,\xe2\x80\x9d and those attacks \xe2\x80\x9cthreaten [the] social, economic and political stability\xe2\x80\x9d of such governments.  McKune Affidavit, App. 137, \xc2\xb616.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ther foreign terrorist organizations attack our NATO allies, thereby implicating important and sensitive multilateral security arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the Republic of Turkey\xe2\x80\x94a fellow member of NATO\xe2\x80\x94is defending itself against a violent insurgency waged by the PKK.  Brief for Government 6; App. 128.  That nation and our other allies would react sharply to Americans furnishing material support to foreign groups like the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the explanation that the support was meant only to further those groups\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d activities.  From Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, there likely are no such activities.  See 352 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 389 (observing that Turkey prohibits membership in the PKK and prosecutes those who provide support to that group, regardless of whether the support is directed to lawful activities).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distinguish material support for a foreign terrorist group\xe2\x80\x99s violent activities and its nonviolent activities, we do not rely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the record evidence.  We have before us an affidavit stating the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion on that question.  The State Department informs us that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he experience and analysis of the U. S. government agencies charged with combating terrorism strongly suppor[t]\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99s finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist organizations further their terrorism.  McKune Affidavit, App. 133, \xc2\xb68.  See <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315) (looking to similar affidavits to support according weight to national security claims).  In the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s view: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the purposes, organizational structure, and clandestine nature of foreign terrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any material support to these organizations will ultimately inure to the benefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether such support was ostensibly intended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 133, \xc2\xb68.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Congress\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, is entitled to deference.  This litigation implicates sensitive and weighty interests of national security and foreign affairs.  The PKK and the LTTE have committed terrorist acts against American citizens abroad, and the material-support statute addresses acute foreign policy concerns involving relationships with our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s allies.  See <em>id.</em>, at 128\xe2\x80\x93133, 137.  We have noted that \xe2\x80\x9cneither the Members of this Court nor most federal judges begin the day with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation and its people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boumediene</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/723/index.html">553 U. S. 723</a>, 797 (2008).  It is vital in this context \xe2\x80\x9cnot to substitute . . . our own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rostker</em> v. <em>Goldberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/57/index.html">453 U. S. 57</a>, 68 (1981).  See <em>Wald</em>, 468 U. S., at 242; <em>Haig</em> v. <em>Agee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/280/index.html">453 U. S. 280</a>, 292 (1981).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns of national security and foreign relations do not warrant abdication of the judicial role.  We do not defer to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the First Amendment, even when such interests are at stake.  We are one with the dissent that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority and expertise in these matters do not automatically trump the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 23.  But when it comes to collecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this area, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rostker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 65, and respect for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions is appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One reason for that respect is that national security and foreign policy concerns arise in connection with efforts to confront evolving threats in an area where information can be difficult to obtain and the impact of certain conduct difficult to assess.  The dissent slights these real constraints in demanding hard proof\xe2\x80\x94with \xe2\x80\x9cdetail,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cspecific facts,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecific evidence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed activities will support terrorist attacks.  See <em>post</em>, at 9, 16, 23.  That would be a dangerous requirement.  In this context, conclusions must often be based on informed judgment rather than concrete evidence, and that reality affects what we may reasonably insist on from the Government.  The material-support statute is, on its face, a preventive measure\xe2\x80\x94it criminalizes not terrorist attacks themselves, but aid that makes the attacks more likely to occur.  The Government, when seeking to prevent imminent harms in the context of international affairs and national security, is not required to conclusively link all the pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its empirical conclusions.  See <em>Zemel</em> v. <em>Rusk</em>, 381 U. S., at 17 (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]ecause of the changeable and explosive nature of contemporary international relations, . . . Congress . . . must of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it customarily wields in domestic areas\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This context is different from that in decisions like <em>Cohen</em>.  In that case, the application of the statute turned on the offensiveness of the speech at issue.  Observing that \xe2\x80\x9cone man\xe2\x80\x99s vulgarity is another\xe2\x80\x99s lyric,\xe2\x80\x9d we invalidated Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s conviction in part because we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmental officials cannot make principled distinctions in this area.\xe2\x80\x9d  403 U. S., at 25.  In this litigation, by contrast, Congress and the Executive are uniquely positioned to make principled distinctions between activities that will further terrorist conduct and undermine United States foreign policy, and those that will not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also find it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.  First, \xc2\xa72339B only applies to designated foreign terrorist organizations.  There is, and always has been, a limited number of those organizations designated by the Executive Branch, see, <em>e.g.,</em> 74 Fed. Reg. 29742 (2009); 62 Fed. Reg. 52650 (1997), and any groups so designated may seek judicial review of the designation.  Second, in response to the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 holdings in this litigation, Congress added clarity to the statute by providing narrowing definitions of the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as an explanation of the knowledge required to violate \xc2\xa72339B.  Third, in effectuating its stated intent not to abridge First Amendment rights, see \xc2\xa72339B(i), Congress has also displayed a careful balancing of interests in creating limited exceptions to the ban on material support.  The definition of material support, for example, excludes medicine and religious materials.  See \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1).  In this area perhaps more than any other, the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s superior capacity for weighing competing interests means that \xe2\x80\x9cwe must be particularly careful not to substitute our judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rostker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 68.  Finally, and most importantly, Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the considered judgment of Congress and the Executive that providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x94even seemingly benign support\xe2\x80\x94bolsters the terrorist activities of that organization.  That judgment, however, is entitled to significant weight, and we have persuasive evidence before us to sustain it.  Given the sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political branches have adequately substantiated their determination that, to serve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing terrorism, it was necessary to prohibit providing material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and services to foreign terrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote only the groups\xe2\x80\x99 nonviolent ends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake.  First, plaintiffs propose to \xe2\x80\x9ctrain members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01.  Congress can, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit this direct training.  It is wholly foreseeable that the PKK could use the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific skill[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that plaintiffs propose to impart, \xc2\xa72339A(b)(2), as part of a broader strategy to promote terrorism.  The PKK could, for example, pursue peaceful negotiation as a means of buying time to recover from short-term setbacks, lulling opponents into complacency, and ultimately preparing for renewed attacks.  See generally A. Marcus, Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence 286\xe2\x80\x93295 (2007) (describing the PKK\xe2\x80\x99s suspension of armed struggle and subsequent return to violence).  A foreign terrorist organization introduced to the structures of the international legal system might use the information to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.  This possibility is real, not remote.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, plaintiffs propose to \xe2\x80\x9cteach PKK members how to petition various representative bodies such as the United Nations for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01.  The Government acts within First Amendment strictures in banning this proposed speech because it teaches the organization how to acquire \xe2\x80\x9crelief,\xe2\x80\x9d which plaintiffs never define with any specificity, and which could readily include monetary aid.  See Brief for Plaintiffs 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 16\xe2\x80\x9317, n. 10; App. 58\xe2\x80\x9359, 80\xe2\x80\x9381.  Indeed, earlier in this litigation, plaintiffs sought to teach the LTTE \xe2\x80\x9cto present claims for tsunami-related aid to mediators and international bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d 552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01, which naturally included monetary relief.  Money is fungible, <em>supra</em>, at 26, and Congress logically concluded that money a terrorist group such as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs propose to teach could be redirected to funding the group\xe2\x80\x99s violent activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, plaintiffs propose to \xe2\x80\x9cengage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cengage in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who live in Sri Lanka.\xe2\x80\x9d  552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01.  As explained above, <em>supra</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320, plaintiffs do not specify their expected level of coordination with the PKK or LTTE or suggest what exactly their \xe2\x80\x9cadvocacy\xe2\x80\x9d would consist of.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposals are phrased at such a high level of generality that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.  See <em>supra</em>, at 20; <em>Grange</em>, 552 U. S., at<em> </em>454; <em>Zemel</em>, 381 U. S., at 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to address the real dangers at stake.  It instead considers only the possible benefits of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed activities in the abstract.  See <em>post</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  The dissent seems unwilling to entertain the prospect that training and advising a designated foreign terrorist organization on how to take advantage of international entities might benefit that organization in a way that facilitates its terrorist activities.  In the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s world, such training is all to the good.  Congress and the Executive, however, have concluded that we live in a different world: one in which the designated foreign terrorist organizations \xe2\x80\x9care so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  AEDPA \xc2\xa7301(a)(7).  One in which, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to close a Kurdish refugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come under the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to respect its \xe2\x80\x98neutral and humanitarian nature.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  McKune Affidavit, App. 135\xe2\x80\x93136, \xc2\xb613.  Training and advice on how to work with the United Nations could readily have helped the PKK in its efforts to use the United Nations camp as a base for terrorist activities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If only good can come from training our adversaries in international dispute resolution, presumably it would have been unconstitutional to prevent American citizens from training the Japanese Government on using international organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes during World War II.  It would, under the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, have been contrary to our commitment to resolving disputes through \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deliberative forces,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 13 (quoting <em>Whitney</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/index.html">274 U. S. 357</a>, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to conclude that assisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort more generally.  That view is not one the First Amendment requires us to embrace.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All this is not to say that any future applications of the material-support statute to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny.  It is also not to say that any other statute relating to speech and terrorism would satisfy the First Amendment.  In particular, we in no way suggest that a regulation of independent speech would pass constitutional muster, even if the Government were to show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organizations.  We also do not suggest that Congress could extend the same prohibition on material support at issue here to domestic organizations.  We simply hold that, in prohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist groups, \xc2\xa72339B does not violate the freedom of speech.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 final claim is that the material-support statute violates their freedom of association under the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs argue that the statute criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE, thereby running afoul of decisions like <em>De Jonge</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/353/index.html">299 U. S. 353</a> (1937), and cases in which we have overturned sanctions for joining the Communist Party, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Keyishian</em> v. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/589/index.html">385 U. S. 589</a> (1967); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Robel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/258/index.html">389 U. S. 258</a> (1967).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim because the statute does not penalize mere association with a foreign terrorist organization.  As the Ninth Circuit put it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe statute does not prohibit being a member of one of the designated groups or vigorously promoting and supporting the political goals of the group. . . . What [\xc2\xa72339B] prohibits is the act of giving material support . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  205 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1133.  Plaintiffs want to do the latter.  Our decisions scrutinizing penalties on simple association or assembly are therefore inapposite.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Robel</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 262 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is precisely because th[e] statute sweeps indiscriminately across all types of association with Communist-action groups, without regard to the quality and degree of membership, that it runs afoul of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>De Jonge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 362.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute burdens their freedom of association because it prevents them from providing support to designated foreign terrorist organizations, but not to other groups.  See Brief for Plaintiffs 56; Reply Brief for Plaintiffs 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  Any burden on plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of association in this regard is justified for the same reasons that we have denied plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 free speech challenge.  It would be strange if the Constitution permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of speech that constitute material support, but did not permit Congress to prohibit that support only to particularly dangerous and lawless foreign organizations.  Congress is not required to ban material support to every group or none at all.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the people of the United States ordained and established that charter of government in part to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for the common defence.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Madison explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ecurity against foreign danger is . . . an avowed and essential object of the American Union.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 41, p. 269 (J.

Being fungible, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 support could, for example, free up other resources, which the organization might put to terrorist ends.  Brief for Respondents in No. 09\xe2\x80\x9389, pp. 54\xe2\x80\x9356 (hereinafter Government Brief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proposition that the two very different kinds of \xe2\x80\x9csupport\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9cfungible,\xe2\x80\x9d however, is not <em>obviously</em> true.  There is no <em>obvious</em> way in which undertaking advocacy for political change through peaceful means or teaching the PKK and LTTE, say, how to petition the United Nations for political change is fungible with other resources that might be put to more sinister ends in the way that donations of money, food, or computer training are fungible.  It is far from obvious that these advocacy activities can themselves be redirected, or will free other resources that can be directed, towards terrorist ends.  Thus, we must determine whether the Government has come forward with evidence to support its claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has provided us with no empirical information that might convincingly support this claim.  Instead, the Government cites only to evidence that Congress was concerned about the \xe2\x80\x9cfungible\xe2\x80\x9d nature in general of resources, predominately money and material goods.  It points to a congressional finding that \xe2\x80\x9cforeign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any <em>contribution</em> to such an organization facilitates that conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(a)(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note following 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72339B (emphasis added).  It also points to a House Report\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9csupply[ing] <em>funds</em>, <em>goods</em>, or <em>services</em>\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9chel[p] defray the cost to the terrorist organization of running the ostensibly legitimate activities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin turn fre[e] an equal sum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93383, p.\xc2\xa081 (1995) (emphasis added).  Finally, the Government refers to a State Department official\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit describing how ostensibly charitable contributions have either been \xe2\x80\x9credirected\xe2\x80\x9d to terrorist ends or, even if spent charitably, have \xe2\x80\x9cunencumber[ed] <em>funds</em> raised from other sources for use in facilitating violent, terrorist activities and gaining political support for these activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134, 136 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most one can say in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor about these statements is that they <em>might </em>be read as offering highly general support for its argument.  The statements do not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 political-advocacy-related activities might actually be \xe2\x80\x9cfungible\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore capable of being diverted to terrorist use.  Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was concerned with \xe2\x80\x9csupport\xe2\x80\x9d of this kind.  The affidavit refers to \xe2\x80\x9cfunds,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfinancing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgoods\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94none of which encompasses the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 activities.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The statutory statement and the House Report use broad terms like \xe2\x80\x9ccontributions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cservices\xe2\x80\x9d that <em>might </em>be construed as encompassing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 activities.  But in context, those terms are more naturally understood as referring to contributions of goods, money, or training and other services (say, computer programming) that could be diverted to, or free funding for, terrorist ends.  See <em>infra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.<em> </em>Peaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into these categories.  And the statute itself suggests that Congress did not intend to curtail freedom of speech or association.  See \xc2\xa72339B(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this section shall be construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>infra</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, the Government says that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposed activities will \xe2\x80\x9cbolste[r] a terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy and strength in a community\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cundermin[e] this nation\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to <em>delegitimize and weaken</em> those groups.\xe2\x80\x9d  Government Brief 56 (emphasis added).  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, too, the Constitution permits application of the statute to activities of the kind at issue in part because those activities could provide a group that engages in terrorism with \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 25.  The Court suggests that, armed with this greater \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy,\xe2\x80\x9d these organizations will more readily be able to obtain material support of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban\xe2\x80\x94money, arms, lodging, and the like.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet the Government does not claim that the statute forbids <em>any </em>speech \xe2\x80\x9clegitimating\xe2\x80\x9d a terrorist group.  Rather, it reads the statute as permitting (1) membership in terrorist organizations, (2) \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceably assembling with members of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d or (3)<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9cindependent advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d on behalf of these organizations.  Government Brief 66, 61, 13.  The Court, too, emphasizes that activities not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>coordinated with</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the terrorist groups are not banned.  See <em>ante</em>, at 21, 26, 31 (emphasis added).  And it argues that speaking, writing, and teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful political ends could \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] it easier for those groups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy\xe2\x80\x9d justification cannot by itself warrant suppression of political speech, advocacy, and association.  Speech, association, and related activities on behalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to legitimate that group.  Thus, were the law to accept a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimating\xe2\x80\x9d effect, in and of itself and without qualification, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a ban, the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold instances where it should be won.  Once one accepts this argument, there is no natural stopping place.  The argument applies as strongly to \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d as to \xe2\x80\x9ccoordinated\xe2\x80\x9d advocacy.  But see <em>ante, </em>at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  That fact is reflected in part in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the ban here, so supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a designated group from filing on behalf of that group an <em>amicus </em>brief before the United Nations or even before this Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9349, 53.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a line designed to accept the legitimacy argument in some instances but not in others.  It is inordinately difficult to distinguish when speech activity will and when it will not initiate the chain of causation the Court suggests\xe2\x80\x94a chain that leads from peaceful advocacy to \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy\xe2\x80\x9d to increased support for the group to an increased supply of material goods that support its terrorist activities.  Even were we to find some such line of distinction, its application would seem so inherently uncertain that it would often, perhaps always, \xe2\x80\x9cchill\xe2\x80\x9d protected speech beyond its boundary.  In short, the justification, put forward simply in abstract terms and without limitation, must <em>always</em>, or it will <em>never</em>, be sufficient. Given the nature of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 activities, \xe2\x80\x9calways\xe2\x80\x9d cannot possibly be the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s answer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy\xe2\x80\x9d justification itself is inconsistent with critically important First Amendment case law.  Consider the cases involving the protection the First Amendment offered those who joined the Communist Party intending only to further its peaceful activities.  In those cases, this Court took account of congressional findings that the Communist Party not only advocated theoretically but also sought to put into practice the overthrow of our Government through force and violence.  The Court had previously accepted Congress\xe2\x80\x99 determinations that the American Communist Party was a \xe2\x80\x9cCommunist action organization\xe2\x80\x9d which (1) acted under the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol, direction, and discipline\xe2\x80\x9d of the world Communist movement, a movement that sought to employ \xe2\x80\x9cespionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cendeavor[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to bring about \xe2\x80\x9cthe overthrow of existing governments by . . . force if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Communist Party of United States</em> v. <em>Subversive Activities Control Bd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/1/index.html">367 U. S. 1</a>, 5\xe2\x80\x936 (1961) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the Court held that the First Amendment protected an American\xe2\x80\x99s right to belong to that party\xe2\x80\x94despite whatever \xe2\x80\x9clegitimating\xe2\x80\x9d effect membership might have had\xe2\x80\x94as long as the person did not share the party\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful purposes.  See, <em>e.g., De Jonge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/353/index.html"></a><a href="/us/299/353/index.html">299 U. S. 353</a>; <em>Scales</em>, 367 U.

S. 258</a> (holding that national security interests did not justify overbroad criminal prohibition on members of Communist-affiliated organizations working in any defense-related facility).  As I have pointed out, those cases draw further support from other cases permitting pure advocacy of even the most unlawful activity\xe2\x80\x94as long as that advocacy is not \xe2\x80\x9cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and \xe2\x80\xa6 likely to incite or produce such action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brandenburg</em>, 395 U. S., at 447.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clegitimating\xe2\x80\x9d theory would seem to apply to these cases with equal justifying force; and, if recognized, it would have led this Court to conclusions other than those it reached.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can the Government overcome these considerations simply by narrowing the covered activities to those that involve <em>coordinated</em>, rather than <em>independent, </em>advocacy. Conversations, discussions, or logistical arrangements might well prove necessary to carry out the speech-related activities here at issue (just as conversations and discussions are a necessary part of <em>membership</em> in any organization).  The Government does not distinguish this kind of \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d from any other.  I am not aware of any form of words that might be used to describe \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d that would not, at a minimum, seriously chill not only the kind of activities the plaintiffs raise before us, but also the \xe2\x80\x9cindependent advocacy\xe2\x80\x9d the Government purports to permit.  And, as for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to distinguish <em>independent </em>advocacy from <em>coordinated </em>advocacy, the former is <em>more </em>likely, not <em>less</em> likely, to confer legitimacy than the latter.  Thus, other things being equal, the distinction \xe2\x80\x9ccoordination\xe2\x80\x9d makes is arbitrary in respect to furthering the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.  And a rule of law that finds the \xe2\x80\x9clegitimacy\xe2\x80\x9d argument adequate in respect to the latter would have a hard time distinguishing a statute that sought to attack the former.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the majority\xe2\x80\x99s development of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s themes.  First, the majority discusses the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98train members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (quoting 552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01).  The majority justifies the criminalization of this activity in significant part on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful negotiation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d might just \xe2\x80\x9cbu[y] time \xe2\x80\xa6 , lulling opponents into complacency.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 32.  And the PKK might use its new information about \xe2\x80\x9cthe structures of the international legal system \xe2\x80\xa6 to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is one to say about these arguments\xe2\x80\x94arguments that would deny First Amendment protection to the peaceful teaching of international human rights law on the ground that a little knowledge about \xe2\x80\x9cthe international legal system\xe2\x80\x9d is too dangerous a thing; that an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent willingness to negotiate might be faked, so let\xe2\x80\x99s not teach him how to try?  What might be said of these claims by those who live, as we do, in a Nation committed to the resolution of disputes through \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberative forces\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Whitney</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/274/357/index.html">274 U. S. 357</a>, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my own view, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s arguments stretch the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cfungibility\xe2\x80\x9d beyond constitutional limits.  Neither Congress nor the Government advanced these particular hypothetical claims.  I am not aware of any case in this Court\xe2\x80\x94not <em>Gitlow</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/268/652/index.html">268 U.

S. 616</a><em>,</em> not the later Communist Party cases decided during the heat of the Cold War\xe2\x80\x94in which the Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or teaching might be criminalized lest it, <em>e.g.</em>, buy negotiating time for an opponent who would put that time to bad use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put otherwise innocent speech or knowledge to bad use is omnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little more than (even informed) speculation.  Hence to accept this kind of argument without more and to apply it to the teaching of a subject such as international human rights law is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text and First Amendment precedent, would automatically forbid the teaching of any subject in a case where national security interests conflict with the First Amendment.  The Constitution does not allow all such conflicts to be decided in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, as I have said, cannot limit the scope of its arguments through its claim that the plaintiffs remain free to engage in the protected activity <em>as long as it is not \xe2\x80\x9ccoordinated.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>That is because there is no practical way to organize classes for a group (say, wishing to learn about human rights law) without \xe2\x80\x9c<em>coordination</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor can the majority limit the scope of its argument by pointing to some special limiting circumstance present here.  That is because the only evidence the majority offers to support its general claim consists of a single reference to a book about terrorism, which the Government did not mention, and which apparently says no more than that at one time the PKK suspended its armed struggle and then returned to it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the majority discusses the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98teach PKK members how to petition various representative bodies such as the United Nations <em>for relief</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 32 (quoting 552 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 921, n.\xc2\xa01; emphasis added).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s only argument with respect to this proposal is that the relief obtained \xe2\x80\x9ccould readily include monetary aid,\xe2\x80\x9d which the PKK might use to buy guns.  <em>Ante</em>, at 32.  The majority misunderstands the word \xe2\x80\x9crelief.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <em>this</em> context, as the record makes clear, the word \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to \xe2\x80\x9cmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d  It refers to recognition under the Geneva Conventions.  See App. 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (2003 Complaint); <em>id., </em>at 79\xe2\x80\x9380 (1998 Complaint); <em>id., </em>at 113 (Fertig Declaration); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 63 (plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 counsel denying that plaintiffs seek to teach about obtaining relief in the form of money).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Throughout, the majority emphasizes that it would defer strongly to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinformed judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante</em>, at 30.  But here, there is no evidence that Congress has made such a judgment regarding the specific activities at issue in these cases.  See <em>infra</em>,<em> </em>at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  In any event, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever the fundamental rights of free speech and assembly are alleged to have been invaded, it must remain open [for judicial determination] whether there actually did exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger, if any, was imminent; and whether the evil apprehended was one so substantial as to justify the stringent restriction interposed by the legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitney</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 378\xe2\x80\x93379 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  In such circumstances, the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial function commands analysis of whether the specific conduct charged falls within the reach of the statute and if so whether the legislation is consonant with the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Landmark Communications, Inc.</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/829/index.html">435 U. S. 829</a>, 844 (1978).  Hence, a legislative declaration \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not preclude enquiry into the question whether, at the time and under the circumstances, the conditions existed which are essential to validity under the Federal Constitution<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whitney</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 378; see also <em>Landmark, supra</em>, at 843 (\xe2\x80\x9cDeference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First Amendment rights are at stake\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concede that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s expertise in foreign affairs may warrant deference in respect to many matters, <em>e.g.</em>, our relations with Turkey.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But it remains for this Court to decide whether the Government has shown that such an interest justifies criminalizing speech activity otherwise protected by the First Amendment.  And the fact that other nations may like us less for granting that protection cannot in and of itself carry the day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I would reemphasize that neither the Government nor the majority points to any specific facts that show that the speech-related activities before us are fungible in some <em>special way </em>or confer some <em>special </em>legitimacy upon the PKK.  Rather, their arguments in this respect are general and speculative.  Those arguments would apply to virtually all speech-related support for a dual-purpose group\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful activities (irrespective of whether the speech-related activity is coordinated).  Both First Amendment logic and First Amendment case law prevent us from \xe2\x80\x9csacrific[ing] First Amendment protections for so speculative a gain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>Democratic National Committee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/index.html">412 U.

Thus, there is \xe2\x80\x9ca serious doubt\xe2\x80\x9d as to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  <em>Crowell</em>,<em> </em>285 U. S., at 62.  And where that is so, we must \xe2\x80\x9cascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>Ashwander</em>, 297 U.

Under this reading, the Government would have to show, at a minimum, that such defendants provided support that they knew was significantly likely to help the organization pursue its unlawful terrorist aims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A person acts with the requisite knowledge if he is aware of (or willfully blinds himself to) a significant likelihood that his or her conduct will materially support the organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist ends.  See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/164/492/index.html">164 U. S. 492</a>, 496 (1896); cf. ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02(2)(b)(ii) (1962).  See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santos</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/507/index.html">553 U. S. 507</a>, 521 (2008) (plurality opinion); cf. Model Penal Code \xc2\xa72.02(7) (willful blindness); S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93605, pt.\xc2\xa01, pp.\xc2\xa059\xe2\x80\x9360 (1977).  A person also acts with the requisite intent if it is his \xe2\x80\x9cconscious objective\xe2\x80\x9d (or purpose) to further those same terrorist ends.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bailey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/394/index.html">444 U. S. 394</a>, 408 (1980); Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72.02(2)(a) and 2.02(5) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely\xe2\x80\x9d).  On the other hand, for the reasons I have set out, see <em>supra, </em>at 9\xe2\x80\x9312, knowledge or intent that this assistance (aimed at lawful activities) could or would help further terrorism simply by helping to legitimate the organization is not sufficient.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading of the statute protects those who engage in pure speech and association ordinarily protected by the First Amendment.  But it does not protect that activity where a defendant purposefully intends it to help terrorism or where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds himself to the fact) that the activity is significantly likely to assist terrorism.  Where the activity fits into these categories of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist ends, the act of providing material support to a known terrorist organization bears a close enough relation to terrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited notwithstanding any First Amendment interest.  Cf. <em>Brandenburg, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/444/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/444/index.html">395 U. S. 444</a><em>.  </em>At the same time, this reading does not require the Government to undertake the difficult task of proving which, as between peaceful and nonpeaceful purposes, a defendant specifically preferred; knowledge is enough.  See <em>Bailey</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 405 (defining specific intent).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text. The statute prohibits \xe2\x80\x9c<em>knowingly </em>provid[ing] <em>material </em>support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Normally we read a criminal statute as applying a <em>mens rea </em>requirement to all of the subsequently listed elements of the crime.  See <em>Flores</em>-<em>Figueroa</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  So read, the defendant would have to know or intend (1) that he is <em>providing </em>support or resources, (2) that he is providing that support <em>to a foreign terrorist organization</em>, and (3) that he is providing support that is <em>material, </em>meaning (4) that his support bears a significant likelihood of furthering the organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist ends.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d  That word can mean being of a physical or worldly nature, but it also can mean \xe2\x80\x9cbeing of real importance or great consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1392 (1961).  Here, it must mean the latter, for otherwise the statute, applying only to physical aid, would not apply to speech at all.  See also \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1) (defining \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98material support or resources\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany property, <em>tangible or intangible</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And if the statute applies only to support that would likely be of real importance or great consequence, it must have importance or consequence in respect to the organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist activities.  That is because support that is not significantly likely to help terrorist activities, for purposes of this statute, neither has \xe2\x80\x9cimportance\xe2\x80\x9d nor is of \xe2\x80\x9cgreat consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d poses no problem.  The statute defines \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d through reference to a list of terms, including those at issue here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctraining,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpert advice or assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpersonnel,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cservice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72339B(g)(4); \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1).  Since these latter terms all fall under the definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9c<em>material </em>support,\xe2\x80\x9d these activities fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope only when they too are \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Stevens</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (citing <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 11 (2004) (definitional phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that the defendant <em>knew </em>the support was material can be read to require the Government to show that the defendant knew that the consequences of his acts had a significant likelihood of furthering the organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist, not just its lawful, aims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I need not decide whether this is the only possible reading of the statute in cases where \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial support\xe2\x80\x9d takes the form of \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmonetary instruments,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial securities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clodging,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csafehouses,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfalse documentation or identification,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cweapons,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clethal substances,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexplosives,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.  \xc2\xa72339A(b)(1).  Those kinds of aid are inherently more likely to help an organization\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist activities, either directly or because they are fungible in nature.  Thus, to show that an individual has provided support of those kinds will normally prove sufficient for conviction (assuming the statute\xe2\x80\x99s other requirements are met).  But where support consists of pure speech or association, I would indulge in no such presumption.  Rather, the Government would have to prove that the defendant knew he was providing support significantly likely to help the organization pursue its unlawful terrorist aims (or, alternatively, that the defendant intended the support to be so used).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s history strongly supports this reading. That history makes clear that Congress primarily sought to end assistance that takes the form of fungible donations of money or goods.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93383, at 38, 43\xe2\x80\x9345, 81; <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  It shows that Congress, when referring to \xe2\x80\x9cexpert services and assistance\xe2\x80\x9d for example, had in mind training that was sufficiently fungible to further terrorism directly, such as an aviation expert\xe2\x80\x99s giving \xe2\x80\x9cadvice\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitat[es] an aircraft hijacking\xe2\x80\x9d or an accountant\xe2\x80\x99s giving \xe2\x80\x9cadvice\xe2\x80\x9d that will \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate the concealment of funds used to support terrorist activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hearing on Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Draft Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, when reporting the relevant bill from Committee, told the Senate:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThis bill also includes provisions making it a crime to knowingly provide material support <em>to the terrorist functions of </em>foreign groups<em> </em>designated by a Presidential<em> </em>finding to be engaged in terrorist activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  142 Cong.

As Part II makes clear, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d doubt\xe2\x80\x94indeed, a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave\xe2\x80\x9d doubt\xe2\x80\x94about the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to criminalize the activities before us.  <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.

We therefore must \xe2\x80\x9cread the statute to eliminate\xe2\x80\x9d that constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cdoub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  X-Citement Video, Inc.</em>, 513 U.

Our consequent reading is consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text; it is consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 basic intent; it interprets but does not significantly add to what the statute otherwise contains.  Cf. <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-seven Photographs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/363/index.html">402 U.

We should adopt it.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having interpreted the statute to impose the <em>mens rea</em> requirement just described, I would remand the cases so that the lower courts could consider more specifically the precise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to engage and determine whether and to what extent a grant of declaratory and injunctive relief were warranted.  I do not see why the majority does not also remand the cases for consideration of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 activities relating to \xe2\x80\x9cadvocating\xe2\x80\x9d for the organizations\xe2\x80\x99 peaceful causes.

It adds that the plaintiffs did not \xe2\x80\x9csuggest what exactly their \xe2\x80\x98advocacy\xe2\x80\x99 would consist of.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 33.  But the majority is wrong about the lack of specificity.  The record contains complaints and affidavits, which describe in detail the forms of advocacy these groups have previously engaged in and in which they would like to continue to engage.  See App. 56\xe2\x80\x9363, 78\xe2\x80\x9387, 95\xe2\x80\x9399, 110\xe2\x80\x93123.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the majority properly rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 speech-related activities amount to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct\xe2\x80\x9d and should be reviewed as such.  Government Brief 44\xe2\x80\x9357.  Hence, I should think the majority would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect of the cases, applying a proper standard of review.

When deciding such cases, courts are aware and must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to the Executive and Legislative Branches the power to provide for the national defense, and that it grants particular authority to the President in matters of foreign affairs.  Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that authority and expertise in these matters do not automatically trump the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals.  Cf. <em>Hamdi </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/542/507/index.html">542 U.

In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I believe the Court has failed to examine the Government\xe2\x80\x99s justifications with sufficient care.  It has failed to insist upon specific evidence, rather than general assertion.  It has failed to require tailoring of means to fit compelling ends.
