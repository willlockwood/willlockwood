That Stevenson was also the owner of several other vessels for which the libellant, from time to time, furnished articles for their equipment for foreign voyages, and that payments were made by Stevenson to the libellant at different times on their general account without application to any particular part of the account.

Where, however, the proceeding is <em>in rem</em> to enforce a specific lien, it is incumbent upon those who seek the aid of the court to establish the existence of such lien in the particular case.  Where repairs have been made or necessaries have been furnished to a foreign ship or to a ship in a port of the state to which she does not belong, the general maritime law, following the civil law, gives the party a lien on the ship itself for his security, and he may well maintain a suit <em>in rem</em> in the admiralty to enforce his right.  But in respect to repairs and necessaries in the port or state to which the ship belongs, the case is governed altogether by the municipal law of that state, and no lien is implied unless it is recognized by that law.  Now it has been long settled, whether originally upon the soundest principles it is now too late to inquire, that by the common law, which is the law of Maryland, materialmen and mechanics furnishing repairs to a domestic ship, have no particular lien upon the ship itself for the recovery of their demands.  A shipwright, indeed, who has taken a ship into his own possession to repair it is not bound to part with the possession until he is paid for the repairs, any more than any other artificer.  But if he has once parted with the possession, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 17 U. S. 444</a></p><p> or has worked upon it, without taking possession, he is not deemed a privileged creditor, having any claim upon the ship itself.</p>\n<p>Without, therefore, entering into a discussion of the particular circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that here there was not, by the principles of law, any lien upon the ship, and, consequently, the decree of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>\n<p><em>Decree reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
