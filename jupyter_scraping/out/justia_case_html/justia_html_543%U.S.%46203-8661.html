At the conclusion of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case, petitioner moved for a not-guilty finding on the firearm count because \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence [was] insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a).  The trial judge granted the motion, finding no evidence to support the requirement of the unlawful possession count that the firearm have a barrel shorter than 16 inches.  The prosecution rested, and the trial proceeded on the other counts.  Before closing argument, the prosecution argued that under Massachusetts precedent, the victim\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the defendant shot him with a \xe2\x80\x9cpistol\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crevolver\xe2\x80\x9d sufficed to establish barrel length.  The judge \xe2\x80\x9creversed\xe2\x80\x9d her previous ruling, allowing the firearm count to go to the jury.  The jury convicted petitioner on all counts.  In affirming, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated because the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s correction of her ruling had not subjected petitioner to a second prosecution or proceeding, and held that Rule 25 did not prohibit the judge from reconsidering her decision.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Submitting the firearm count to the jury plainly subjected petitioner to further \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d which are prohibited following a midtrial acquittal by the court, Smalis</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/140/index.html">476 U.

In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/564/index.html">430 U. S. 564</a>, this Court rejected reasoning identical to the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s claim that jeopardy did not terminate midtrial because the judge\xe2\x80\x99s determination was legal rather than factual.  How Massachusetts characterizes the ruling is not binding on this Court.  <em>Smalis, supra, </em>at 144, n.\xc2\xa05.  What matters is that, as the Massachusetts Rules authorize, the judge \xe2\x80\x9cevaluated the [Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin Linen, supra, </em>at 572.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the judge to reconsider the acquittal later in the trial.  While the Clause may permit States to create a procedure for reconsidering a midtrial determination of insufficiency of proof, Massachusetts had no such procedure at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Its Rules allowed only clerical errors, or those \xe2\x80\x9carising from oversight or omission,\xe2\x80\x9d to be corrected at any time.  Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42.  A few Commonwealth cases have provided that interlocutory rulings are subject to reconsideration, but these cases, without more, do not extend that principle to a not-guilty finding under Rule 25, which purports not to be interlocutory but to end the case.  A seeming dismissal may induce a defendant to present a defense to the undismissed charges when he would be better advised to stand silent.  The Double Jeopardy Clause cannot be allowed to become a potential snare for those who reasonably rely on it.  If, after a facially unqualified midtrial acquittal on one count, the trial has proceeded to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of evidence on the remaining counts, the acquittal must be treated as final, unless the availability of reconsideration has been plainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the evidence.

The question presented in this case is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the judge to reconsider that acquittal later in the trial.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Melvin Smith was tried before a jury in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, on charges relating to the shooting of his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s cousin.  The indictments charged three counts: armed assault with intent to murder; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; and unlawful possession of a firearm.  The \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm\xe2\x80\x9d element of the last offense requires proof that the weapon had a barrel \xe2\x80\x9cless than 16 inches\xe2\x80\x9d in length.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 140, \xc2\xa7121 (West 2002) (definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm\xe2\x80\x9d); ch. 269, \xc2\xa710(a) (West 2000).  The indictment in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case so charged.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend was tried before the same jury as an accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The victim testified at trial that petitioner had shot him with \xe2\x80\x9ca pistol,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically \xe2\x80\x9ca revolver\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cappeared to be a .32 or a .38.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 12, 14.  The prosecution introduced no other evidence about the firearm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case, petitioner moved for a required finding of not guilty on the firearm count, see Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a) (2002), in part because the Commonwealth had not proved that the gun barrel was less than 16 inches.  At sidebar, after hearing argument from the prosecutor, the trial judge granted the motion, reasoning that there was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a scintilla of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner had possessed a weapon with a barrel length of less than 16 inches.  App. 21.  The trial court marked petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion with the handwritten endorsement \xe2\x80\x9cFiled and after hearing, Allowed,\xe2\x80\x9d and the allowance of the motion was entered on the docket.  Consolidated Brief and Record Appendix for Defendant in No. 00\xe2\x80\x93P\xe2\x80\x931215 (Mass. App. Ct.), p. A.21; App. 3.  The sidebar conference then concluded, and the prosecution rested.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The judge did not notify the jury of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal on the firearm count.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defense case then proceeded.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s codefendant presented one witness, and both defendants then rested.  During the short recess before closing arguments, the prosecutor brought to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention a Massachusetts precedent under which (he contended) the victim\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about the kind of gun sufficed to establish that the barrel was shorter than 16 inches.  He requested that the court defer ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence until after the jury verdict.  The judge agreed, announcing orally that she was \xe2\x80\x9creversing\xe2\x80\x9d her previous ruling and allowing the firearm-possession count to go to the jury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 75.  Corresponding notations were made on the original of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion and on the docket.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury convicted petitioner on all three counts, though it acquitted his codefendant of the accessory charge.  Petitioner then submitted to a bench trial on an additional repeat-offender element of the firearm-possession charge; the judge found him guilty.  Petitioner received a sentence of ten to twelve years\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration on the firearm-possession charge, concurrent with his sentence on the other counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner sought review in the Appeals Court of Massachusetts.  That court affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated because the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s correction of her ruling had not subjected petitioner to a second prosecution or proceeding.  It also rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial ruling was final because Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) required the judge to decide petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion when it was made, without reserving decision;[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the court reasoned that the Rule does not preclude the judge from reconsidering.  58 Mass.

Hale, Pleas of the Crown *246, we have long held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits reexamination of a court-decreed acquittal to the same extent it prohibits reexamination of an acquittal by jury verdict.  See <em>Richardson</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/317/index.html">468 U. S. 317</a>, 325, n. 5 (1984); <em>Sanabria</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/index.html"></a><a href="/us/437/54/index.html">437 U.

This is so whether the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling of acquittal comes in a bench trial or, as here, in a trial by jury.  See <em>Fong Foo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/141/index.html">369 U. S. 141</a>, 143 (1962) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Sanabria,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 77\xe2\x80\x9378; <em>Martin Linen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 565\xe2\x80\x93566, 574\xe2\x80\x93575.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases have made a single exception to the principle that acquittal by judge precludes reexamination of guilt no less than acquittal by jury: When a jury returns a verdict of guilty and a trial judge (or an appellate court) sets aside that verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution appeal to reinstate the jury verdict of guilty.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/332/index.html">420 U. S. 332</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (1975).  But if the prosecution has not yet obtained a conviction, further proceedings to secure one are impermissible: \xe2\x80\x9c[S]ubjecting the defendant to postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smalis</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/140/index.html"></a><a href="/us/476/140/index.html">476 U. S. 140</a>, 145 (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the judge in this case first granted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, there had been no jury verdict.  Submission of the firearm count to the jury plainly subjected petitioner to further \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d prohibited by <em>Smalis</em> following an acquittal.  The first question, then, is whether the judge\xe2\x80\x99s initial ruling on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion was, in fact, a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It certainly appeared to be.  Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) directs the trial judge to enter a finding of not guilty \xe2\x80\x9cif the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  An order entering such a finding thus meets the definition of acquittal that our double-jeopardy cases have consistently used: it \xe2\x80\x9cactually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin Linen, supra,</em> at 571; accord, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Price</em> v. <em>Vincent,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/634/index.html"></a><a href="/us/538/634/index.html">538 U. S. 634</a>, 640 (2003); <em>Burks</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/437/1/index.html">437 U. S. 1</a>, 10 (1978).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commonwealth contends that the grant of a motion for a required finding of not guilty in a jury trial is a purely legal determination, the factfinding function being reserved to the jury.  Brief for Respondent 14 (citing <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Lowder,</em> 432 Mass. 92, 96\xe2\x80\x9397, 731 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 510, 515 (2000)).  Thus, the Commonwealth reasons, jeopardy did not terminate midtrial on any of the three counts, since neither judge nor jury had rendered a factual determination that would bring jeopardy to an end.  We rejected identical reasoning in <em>Martin Linen, supra,</em> holding that jeopardy ends when, following discharge of a hung jury, a judge grants a motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.  Rule 29 created the judge-ordered \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment of acquittal\xe2\x80\x9d in place of the directed verdict, which was at least fictionally returned by the jury at the judge\xe2\x80\x99s direction, rather than coming from the judge alone.  But, we said in <em>Martin Linen</em>, change in nomenclature and removal of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s theoretical role make no difference; the Rule 29 judgment of acquittal is a substantive determination that the prosecution has failed to carry its burden.  Thus, even when the jury is the <em>primary</em> factfinder, the trial judge still resolves elements of the offense in granting a Rule 29 motion in the absence of a jury verdict.  See <em>Martin Linen, supra,</em> at 571\xe2\x80\x93575.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same is true here.  (Indeed, Massachusetts patterned its Rule 25 on Federal Rule 29 and adopted prior directed-verdict practice without change.  See <em>Lowder</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 95, 731 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 514.)  Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 characterization of the required finding of not guilty as a legal rather than factual determination is, \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of double jeopardy law, \xe2\x80\xa6 not binding on us,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Smalis,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 144, n.\xc2\xa05; what matters is that, as the Massachusetts rules authorize, the judge \xe2\x80\x9cevaluated the [Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin Linen,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 572.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that the judge acquitted petitioner of the firearm-possession charge,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] we must turn to the more difficult question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause permitted her to reconsider that acquittal once petitioner and his codefendant had rested their cases.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to note, at the outset, that the facts of this case gave petitioner no reason to doubt the finality of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.  The prosecutor did not make or reserve a motion for reconsideration, or seek a continuance that would allow him to provide the court with favorable authority.  Rather, the sidebar conference concluded, the court asked the prosecutor if he had \xe2\x80\x9cany further evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.  At this point, the Commonwealth rests their case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 22.  Nor did the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling appear on its face to be tentative.  The trial court was not permitted by Massachusetts procedure to defer ruling on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a), or to require the defendants to go forward with their cases while the prosecution reserved the right to present more evidence, <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Cote,</em> 15 Mass. App. 229, 242, 444 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1282, 1290\xe2\x80\x931291 (1983).  And when the prosecutor suggested that he be given a chance to reopen his case before the defendants proceeded, the court rejected the suggestion because it was time to rule on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  App. 22; n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Was this apparently final ruling in fact final?  We think, and petitioner does not dispute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, that as a general matter state law may prescribe that a judge\xe2\x80\x99s midtrial determination of the sufficiency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proof can be reconsidered.  Cf. <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Goldhammer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/28/index.html">474 U. S. 28</a>, 30 (1985) <em>(per curiam)</em> (state law regarding appealability may affect defendant\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that a sentence is final for double-jeopardy purposes).  We can find no instance in which a State has done this by statute or rule, but some state courts have held, as a matter of common law or in the exercise of their supervisory power, that a court-directed judgment of acquittal is not effective until it is signed and entered in the docket, <em>Harden</em> v. <em>State,</em> 160 Ga. App. 514, 515, 287 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 329, 331 (1981), until a formal order is issued, <em>State</em> v. <em>Collins,</em> 112 Wash. 2d 303, 308\xe2\x80\x93309, 771 P.\xc2\xa02d 350, 353 (1989), or until the motion hearing is concluded, <em>Watson</em> v. <em>State,</em> 410 So.\xc2\xa02d 207, 209 (Fla. App. 1982).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial, however, Massachusetts had not adopted any such rule of nonfinality.  Its Rules of Criminal Procedure provided that only <em>clerical</em> errors in a judgment or order, or errors \xe2\x80\x9carising from oversight or omission,\xe2\x80\x9d were subject to correction at any time.  Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42 (2002).  Massachusetts cites a few Commonwealth cases supporting the general proposition that interlocutory rulings (rulings on pretrial motions, evidentiary rulings, and the like) are subject to reconsideration.  But it is far from obvious that this principle extends to entry of a required finding of not guilty under Rule 25 (or to its common-law predecessor, the directed verdict)\xe2\x80\x94which on its face, at least, purports not to be interlocutory but to end the case.  We think much more was required here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It may suffice for an appellate court to announce the state-law rule that midtrial acquittals are tentative in a case where reconsideration of the acquittal occurred at a stage in the trial where the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s justifiable ignorance of the rule could not possibly have caused him prejudice.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  But when, as here, the trial has proceeded to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of his case, the possibility of prejudice arises.  The seeming dismissal may induce a defendant to present a defense to the undismissed charges when he would be better advised to stand silent.  Many jurisdictions still follow the traditional rule that after trial or on appeal, sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges are reviewed on the basis of the <em>entire</em> trial record, even if the defendant moved for acquittal when the prosecution rested and the court erroneously denied that motion.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Smith</em> v. <em>State,</em> 509 P.\xc2\xa02d 1391, 1397 (Okla. Crim. App. 1973); <em>Deal</em> v. <em>State,</em> 657 P.\xc2\xa02d 404, 405 (Alaska App. 1983) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  See generally Comment, The Motion for Acquittal: A Neglected Safeguard, 70 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1151, 1152\xe2\x80\x931158 (1961).  In these jurisdictions, the defendant who puts on a case runs \xe2\x80\x9cthe risk that \xe2\x80\xa6 he will bolster the Government case enough for it to support a verdict of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McGautha</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/183/index.html">402 U. S. 183</a>, 215 (1971).  The defendant\xe2\x80\x99s evidence \xe2\x80\x9cmay lay the foundation for otherwise inadmissible evidence in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s initial presentation or provide corroboration for essential elements of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Calderon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/160/index.html">348 U. S. 160</a>, 164, n. 1 (1954) (citation omitted).  In all jurisdictions, moreover, false assurance of acquittal on one count may induce the defendant to present defenses to the remaining counts that are inadvisable\xe2\x80\x94for example, a defense that entails admission of guilt on the acquitted count.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Double Jeopardy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee cannot be allowed to become a potential snare for those who reasonably rely upon it.  If, after a facially unqualified midtrial dismissal of one count, the trial has proceeded to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s introduction of evidence, the acquittal must be treated as final, unless the availability of reconsideration has been plainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the evidence.  That requirement was not met here.  The Commonwealth has failed to show that under state procedure as it existed at the time of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on the motion for a required finding of not guilty was automatically, or even presumptively, nonfinal.  At most it has shown that the ruling was wrong because the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s evidence was, as a matter of law, sufficient\xe2\x80\x94a point that the dissent emphasizes, echoing the opinion below.  See <em>post</em>, at 2, 4, 5.  But any contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself (even absent provision by the State) leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the well established rule that the bar will attach to a pre-verdict acquittal that is patently wrong in law.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Smalis,</em> 476 U. S., at 144, n.\xc2\xa07; <em>Sanabria,</em> 437 U. S., at 68\xe2\x80\x9369, 75, 78; <em>Martin Linen,</em> 430 U. S., at 571; <em>Fong Foo</em>, 369 U. S., at 143.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Massachusetts argues that if the Double Jeopardy Clause does not allow for reconsideration, every erroneous grant of a directed-verdict motion will be unremediable, even one attributable to mistaken expression that is promptly corrected.  We think not.  Double-jeopardy principles have never been thought to bar the immediate repair of a genuine error in the announcement of an acquittal, even one rendered by a jury.  See M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy 61 (1969); <em>King</em> v. <em>Parkin</em>, 1 Mood. 45, 46\xe2\x80\x9347, 168 Eng. Rep. 1179, 1180 (1824).  And of course States can protect themselves still further against the \xe2\x80\x9coccasional errors\xe2\x80\x9d of law that the dissent thinks \xe2\x80\x9cinevitabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in the course of trial, <em>post</em>, at 4, by rendering midtrial acquittals nonfinal.  (Massachusetts, as we have observed, has specifically provided for the correction of mistaken utterances or scrivener\xe2\x80\x99s errors, but not for the reconsideration of legal conclusions.  See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42 (2002).)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prosecutors are not without protection against ill-considered acquittal rulings.  States can and do craft procedural rules that allow trial judges \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum opportunity to consider with care a pending acquittal motion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Martin Linen,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 574, including the option of deferring consideration until after the verdict.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, D.\xc2\xa0C. Super. Ct. Crim. Proc. Rule 29(b) (2003); N.\xc2\xa0Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7290.10(1)(b) (West 2002); W. Va. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b) (2004).  (At least one State has altogether precluded midtrial acquittals by the court.  See Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7175.381(1) (2001).)  Moreover, a prosecutor can seek to persuade the court to correct its legal error before it rules, or at least before the proceedings move forward.  See <em>Price</em> v. <em>Vincent,</em> 538 U. S., at 637\xe2\x80\x93638, 642\xe2\x80\x93643, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Indeed, the prosecutor in this case convinced the judge to reconsider her acquittal ruling on the basis of legal authority he had obtained during a 15-minute recess before closing arguments.  See App. 71\xe2\x80\x9372, 74.

This was not a \xe2\x80\x9crecogni[tion of] the distinction between appeals and continuing proceedings before the initial tribunal,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 4, but rather a recognition that the initial jeopardy does not end until there is a <em>final </em>decision.

See <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 5\xe2\x80\x936.  But the Double Jeopardy Clause has never required prejudice beyond the very exposure to a second jeopardy.  To put it differently: requiring someone to defend against a charge of which he has already been acquitted is prejudice <em>per se</em> for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause\xe2\x80\x94even when the acquittal was erroneous because the evidence was sufficient.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sanabria</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/index.html"></a><a href="/us/437/54/index.html">437 U. S. 54</a>, 77\xe2\x80\x9378 (1978).  Of course it is not even clear that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s due-process analysis would acknowledge prejudice when a midtrial acquittal was correct when rendered, so long as evidence sufficient to sustain the charge was eventually introduced (after the acquittal and during the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case, see <em>supra</em>, at 9).  Our double-jeopardy cases make clear that an acquittal bars the prosecution from seeking \xe2\x80\x9canother opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster\xe2\x80\x9d before jeopardy terminated.  <em>Burks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/437/1/index.html">437 U.

The Court unanimously answers \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a general matter state law may prescribe that a judge\xe2\x80\x99s midtrial determination of the sufficiency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s proof can be reconsidered.\xe2\x80\x9d).  A State may provide for such reconsideration, the Court also recognizes, by legislation or by judicial rule, common-law decision, or exercise of supervisory power.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8.  According to the Appeals Court of Massachusetts, the State has so provided through its decisional law.  58 Mass. App. 166, 171, 788 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 977, 983 (2003); see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskell</em>, 438 Mass. 790, 792, 784 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 625, 628 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cA judge\xe2\x80\x99s power to reconsider his own decisions during the pendency of a case is firmly rooted in the common law \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The view held by the Massachusetts court on this issue is hardly novel.

Otherwise, according to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee [would] become a potential snare for those who reasonably rely upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree that, as a trial unfolds, a defendant must be accorded a timely, fully informed opportunity to meet the State\xe2\x80\x99s charges.  I would so hold as a matter not of double jeopardy, but of due process.  See <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Netherland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/152/index.html">518 U. S. 152</a>, 171 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cBasic to due process in criminal proceedings is the right to a full, fair, potentially effective opportunity to defend against the State\xe2\x80\x99s charges.\xe2\x80\x9d).  On the facts presented here, however, as the Massachusetts Appeals Court observed, see 58 Mass. App., at 171, 788 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 983, defendant-petitioner Smith suffered no prejudice fairly attributable to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case acted impatiently and made a mistake at the close of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Cutting short the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s objections, see App. 20\xe2\x80\x9322, she granted Smith\xe2\x80\x99s motion for a \xe2\x80\x9crequired finding of not guilty\xe2\x80\x9d on one of the three charges contained in the indictment, unlawful possession of a firearm, <em>id.</em>, at 20.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  She did so on the ground that the State had failed to prove an essential element of the crime, <em>i.e.</em>, that the barrel of the gun Smith was charged with possessing was less than 16 inches.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 269, \xc2\xa710(a) (West 2000) (rendering possession of a \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm,\xe2\x80\x9d unless exempted, unlawful); ch. 140, \xc2\xa7121 (West 2002) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cfirearm\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cpistol\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crevolver\xe2\x80\x9d with a barrel length \xe2\x80\x9cless than 16 inches\xe2\x80\x9d).  The ruling for Smith was endorsed on the motion and recorded on the docket, but it was not communicated to the jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge corrected her error the same day it was made.  She did so in advance of closing arguments and her charge to the jury.  See App. 71\xe2\x80\x9374.  The trial judge retracted her initial ruling and denied the motion for a required finding of not guilty because the prosecutor had called to her attention a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts directly on point, <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Sperrazza</em>, 372 Mass. 667, 363 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 673 (1977).  In that case, Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 highest court held that a jury may infer a barrel length of less than 16 inches from testimony that the weapon in question was a revolver or handgun.  <em>Id.</em>, at 670, 363 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 675.  Here, there was such testimony.  The victim in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case had testified that the gun he saw in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s hand was a \xe2\x80\x9c.32 or .38\xe2\x80\x9d caliber \xe2\x80\x9cpistol.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 12.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s new ruling based on <em>Sperrazza</em> was entered on the docket, Smith did not move to reopen the case, and the jury convicted him on all charges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Smith urges that our decision in <em>Smalis</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/140/index.html">476 U. S. 140</a> (1986), controls this case.  I disagree.  In <em>Smalis</em>, the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars appellate review of a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of a motion to acquit, because reversal would lead to a remand for further trial proceedings.  <em>Id.</em>, at 146.  An appeal, including an interlocutory appeal, moves a case from a court of first instance to an appellate forum, and necessarily signals that the trial court has ruled with finality on the appealed issue or issues.  A trial court\xe2\x80\x99s reconsideration of its initial decision to grant a motion, on the other hand, occurs before the court of first instance has disassociated itself from the case or any issue in it.  Trial courts have historically revisited midtrial rulings, as earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, for the practical exigencies of trial mean that judges inevitably will commit occasional errors.  In contrast, the government traditionally could pursue no appeal at any stage of a criminal case, however mistaken the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s pro-defense ruling.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Scott,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/82/index.html">437 U. S. 82</a>, 84\xe2\x80\x9386 (1978) (discussing the evolution of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to appeal).  This Court has long recognized the distinction between appeals and continuing proceedings before the initial tribunal prior to the rendition of a final adjudication.  Compare Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b), quoted <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and <em>Swisher</em> v. <em>Brady,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/204/index.html">438 U.
