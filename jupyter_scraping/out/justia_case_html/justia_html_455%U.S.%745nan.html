N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 384-b.4.(d), 384-b.7.(a) (McKinney Supp.1981-1982) (Soc.Serv.Law).  The New York Family Court Act \xc2\xa7 622 (McKinney 1975 and Supp.1981-1982) (Fam.Ct.Act) requires that only a "fair preponderance of the evidence" support that finding.  Thus, in New York, the factual certainty required to extinguish the parent-child relationship is no greater than that necessary to award money damages in an ordinary civil action.</p>\n<p>Today we hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands more than this.  Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 455 U. S. 748</a></p><p> their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>New York authorizes its officials to remove a child temporarily from his or her home if the child appears "neglected," within the meaning of Art. 10 of the Family Court Act.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1012(f), 1021-1029.  Once removed, a child under the age of 18 customarily is placed "in the care of an authorized agency," Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7 384-b.7.(a), usually a state institution or a foster home.  At that point, "the state\'s first obligation is to help the family with services to . . . reunite it. . . ."  \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(a)(iii).  But if convinced that "positive, nurturing parent-child relationships no longer exist," \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(b), the State may initiate "permanent neglect" proceedings to free the child for adoption.</p>\n<p>The State bifurcates its permanent neglect proceeding into "factfinding" and "dispositional" hearings.  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 622, 623.  At the factfinding stage, the State must prove that the child has been "permanently neglected," as defined by Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 614.1.(a)-(d) and Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7 384-b.7.(a).  <em>See</em> Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 622.  The Family Court judge then determines at a subsequent dispositional hearing what placement would serve the child\'s best interests.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 623, 631.</p>\n<p>At the factfinding hearing, the State must establish, among other things, that, for more than a year after the child entered state custody, the agency "made diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship."  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 614.1.(c), 611.  The State must further prove that, during that same period, the child\'s natural parents failed</p>\n<p>"substantially and continuously or repeatedly to maintain contact with or plan for the future of the child although physically and financially able to do so."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 614.1.(d).  Should the State support its allegations by "a fair preponderance of the evidence," \xc2\xa7 622, the child may be declared permanently neglected.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="749">Page 455 U. S. 749</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 611.  That declaration empowers the Family Court judge to terminate permanently the natural parents\' rights in the child.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 631(c), 634.  Termination denies the natural parents physical custody, as well as the rights ever to visit, communicate with, or regain custody of, the child. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>New York\'s permanent neglect statute provides natural parents with certain procedural protections. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But New York permits its officials to establish "permanent neglect" with less proof than most States require.  Thirty-five States, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands currently specify a higher standard of proof, in parental rights termination proceedings, than a "fair preponderance of the evidence." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The only analogous federal statute of which we are aware </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 455 U. S. 750</a></p><p> permits termination of parental rights solely upon "evidence beyond a reasonable doubt."  Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-608, \xc2\xa7 102(f), 92 Stat. 3072, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1912(f) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  The question here is whether </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 455 U. S. 751</a></p><p> New York\'s "fair preponderance of the evidence" standard is constitutionally sufficient.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners John Santosky II and Annie Santosky are the natural parents of Tina and John III.  In November, 1973, after incidents reflecting parental neglect, respondent Kramer, Commissioner of the Ulster County Department of Social Services, initiated a neglect proceeding under Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 1022 and removed Tina from her natural home.  About 10 months later, he removed John III and placed him with foster parents.  On the day John was taken, Annie Santosky gave birth to a third child, Jed.  When Jed was only three days old, respondent transferred him to a foster home on the ground that immediate removal was necessary to avoid imminent danger to his life or health.</p>\n<p>In October, 1978, respondent petitioned the Ulster County Family Court to terminate petitioners\' parental rights in the three children. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the "fair preponderance of the evidence" standard specified in Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 622.  The Family Court Judge rejected this constitutional challenge, App. 29 30, and weighed the evidence under the statutory standard.  While acknowledging that the Santoskys had maintained contact with their children, the judge found those visits, "at best, superficial and devoid of any real emotional content."  <em>Id.</em> at 21.  After </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 455 U. S. 752</a></p><p> deciding that the agency had made "<em>diligent efforts\' to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship," <em>id.</em> at 30, he concluded that the Santoskys were incapable, even with public assistance, of planning for the future of their children.  <em>Id.</em> at 33-37.  The judge later held a dispositional hearing and ruled that the best interests of the three children required permanent termination of the Santoskys\' custody. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 39.\n</em></p>\n<p>Petitioners appealed, again contesting the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 622\'s standard of proof. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed, holding application of the preponderance of the evidence standard "proper and constitutional."  <em>In re John AA,</em> 75 App.Div.2d 910, 427 N.Y.S.2d 319, 320 (1980).  That standard, the court reasoned, "recognizes and seeks to balance rights possessed by the child . . . with those of the natural parents. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The New York Court of Appeals then dismissed petitioners\' appeal to that court "upon the ground that no substantial constitutional question is directly involved."  App. 55.  We granted certiorari to consider petitioners\' constitutional claim.  450 U.S. 993 (1981).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Last Term, in <em>Lassiter v.

Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.  If anything, persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs.  When the State moves to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 455 U. S. 754</a></p><p> destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.

Texas, supra;</em> deportation, <em>Woodby v. INS, supra;</em> and denaturalization, <em>Chaunt v. United States, supra,</em> and <em>Schneiderman v. United States, supra,</em> this Court has identified losses of individual liberty sufficiently serious to warrant imposition of an elevated burden of proof.  Yet juvenile delinquency adjudications, civil commitment, deportation, and denaturalization, at least to a degree, are all reversible official actions.  Once affirmed on appeal, a New York decision terminating parental rights is <em>final</em> and irrevocable.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra.</em>  Few forms of state action are both so severe and so irreversible.</p>\n<p>Thus, the first <em>Eldridge</em> factor -- the private interest affected -- weighs heavily against use of the preponderance standard at a state-initiated permanent neglect proceeding.  We do not deny that the child and his foster parents are also deeply interested in the outcome of that contest.  But at the factfinding stage of the New York proceeding, the focus emphatically is not on them.</p>\n<p>The factfinding does not purport -- and is not intended -- to balance the child\'s interest in a normal family home against the parents\' interest in raising the child.  Nor does it purport to determine whether the natural parents or the foster parents would provide the better home.  Rather, the factfinding hearing pits the State directly against the parents.  The State alleges that the natural parents are at fault.  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 614.1.(d).  The questions disputed and decided are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 455 U. S. 760</a></p><p> what the State did -- "made diligent efforts," \xc2\xa7 614.1.(c) -- and what the natural parents did not do -- "maintain contact with or plan for the future of the child."  \xc2\xa7 614.1.(d).  The State marshals an array of public resources to prove its case and disprove the parents\' case.  Victory by the State not only makes termination of parental rights possible; it entails a judicial determination that the parents are unfit to raise their own children. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>At the factfinding, the State cannot presume that a child and his parents are adversaries.  After the State has established parental unfitness at that initial proceeding, the court may assume at the <em>dispositional</em> stage that the interests of the child and the natural parents do diverge.  <em>See</em> Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 631 (judge shall make his order "solely on the basis of the best interests of the child," and thus has no obligation to consider the natural parents\' rights in selecting dispositional alternatives).  But until the State proves parental unfitness, the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 455 U. S. 761</a></p><p> at the factfinding, the interests of the child and his natural parents coincide to favor use of error-reducing procedures.</p>\n<p>However substantial the foster parents\' interests may be, <em>cf. Smith v. Organization of Foster Families,</em> 431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/816/case.html#845">431 U. S. 845</a></span>-847, they are not implicated directly in the factfinding stage of a state-initiated permanent neglect proceeding against the natural parents.  If authorized, the foster parents may pit their interests directly against those of the natural parents by initiating their own permanent neglect proceeding.  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 1055(d); Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3846.3(b), 392.7.(c).  Alternatively, the foster parents can make their case for custody at the dispositional stage of a state-initiated proceeding, where the judge already has decided the issue of permanent neglect and is focusing on the placement that would serve the child\'s best interests.  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 623, 631.  For the foster parents, the State\'s failure to prove permanent neglect may prolong the delay and uncertainty until their foster child is freed for adoption.  But for the natural parents, a finding of permanent neglect can cut off forever their rights in their child.  Given this disparity of consequence, we have no difficulty finding that the balance of private interests strongly favors heightened procedural protections.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Under <em>Mathews v. Eldridge,</em> we next must consider both the risk of erroneous deprivation of private interests resulting from use of a "fair preponderance" standard and the likelihood that a higher evidentiary standard would reduce that risk.  <em>See</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#335">424 U. S. 335</a></span>.  Since the factfinding phase of a permanent neglect proceeding is an adversary contest between the State and the natural parents, the relevant question is whether a preponderance standard fairly allocates the risk of an erroneous factfinding between these two parties. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="762">Page 455 U. S. 762</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In New York, the factfinding stage of a state-initiated permanent neglect proceeding bears many of the indicia of a criminal trial.  <em>Cf. Lassiter v. Department of Social Services,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html#42">452 U. S. 42</a></span>-44 (first dissenting opinion); <em>Meltzer v. C. Buck LeCraw &amp; Co.,</em> 402 U.S. 954, 959 (1971) (Black, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  <em>See also</em> dissenting opinion, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#777">455 U. S. 777</a></span>-779 (describing procedures employed at factfinding proceeding).  The Commissioner of Social Services charges the parents with permanent neglect.  They are served by summons.  Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 614, 616, 617.  The factfinding hearing is conducted pursuant to formal rules of evidence.  \xc2\xa7 624.  The State, the parents, and the child are all represented by counsel.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 249, 262.  The State seeks to establish a series of historical facts about the intensity of its agency\'s efforts to reunite the family, the infrequency and insubstantiality of the parents\' contacts with their child, and the parents\' inability or unwillingness to formulate a plan for the child\'s future.  The attorneys submit documentary evidence, and call witnesses who are subject to cross-examination.  Based on all the evidence, the judge then determines whether the State has proved the statutory elements of permanent neglect by a fair preponderance of the evidence.  \xc2\xa7 622.</p>\n<p>At such a proceeding, numerous factors combine to magnify the risk of erroneous factfinding.  Permanent neglect proceedings employ imprecise substantive standards that leave determinations unusually open to the subjective values of the judge.  <em>See Smith v. Organization of Foster Families,</em> 431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/816/case.html#835">431 U. S. 835</a></span>, n. 36.  In appraising the nature and quality of a complex series of encounters among the agency, the parents, and the child, the court possesses unusual discretion to underweigh probative facts that might favor the parent. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 455 U. S. 763</a></p><p> Because parents subject to termination proceedings are often poor, uneducated, or members of minority groups, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/816/case.html#833">431 U. S. 833</a></span>-835, such proceedings are often vulnerable to judgments based on cultural or class bias.</p>\n<p>The State\'s ability to assemble its case almost inevitably dwarfs the parents\' ability to mount a defense.  No predetermined limits restrict the sums an agency may spend in prosecuting a given termination proceeding.  The State\'s attorney usually will be expert on the issues contested and the procedures employed at the factfinding hearing, and enjoys full access to all public records concerning the family.  The State may call on experts in family relations, psychology, and medicine to bolster its case.  Furthermore, the primary witnesses at the hearing will be the agency\'s own professional caseworkers, whom the State has empowered both to investigate the family situation and to testify against the parents.  Indeed, because the child is already in agency custody, the State even has the power to shape the historical events that form the basis for termination. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 455 U. S. 764</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The disparity between the adversaries\' litigation resources is matched by a striking asymmetry in their litigation options.  Unlike criminal defendants, natural parents have no "double jeopardy" defense against repeated state termination efforts.  If the State initially fails to win termination, as New York did here, <em>see</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra,</em> it always can try once again to cut off the parents\' rights after gathering more or better evidence.  Yet even when the parents have attained the level of fitness required by the State, they have no similar means by which they can forestall future termination efforts.</p>\n<p>Coupled with a "fair preponderance of the evidence" standard, these factors create a significant prospect of erroneous termination.  A standard of proof that, by its very terms, demands consideration of the quantity, rather than the quality, of the evidence may misdirect the factfinder in the marginal case.  <em>See In re Winship,</em> 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#371">397 U.

By so saying, the court suggested that a preponderance standard properly allocates the risk of error between the parents and the child.

Even accepting the court\'s assumption, we cannot agree with its conclusion that a preponderance standard fairly distributes the risk of error between parent and child.

For the child, the likely consequence of an erroneous failure to terminate is preservation of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="766">Page 455 U. S. 766</a></p><p> an uneasy <em>status quo.</em> [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  For the natural parents, however, the consequence of an erroneous termination is the unnecessary destruction of their natural family.  A standard that allocates the risk of error nearly equally between those two outcomes does not reflect properly their relative severity.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Two state interests are at stake in parental rights termination proceedings -- a <em>parens patriae</em> interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child and a fiscal and administrative interest in reducing the cost and burden of such proceedings.  A standard of proof more strict than preponderance of the evidence is consistent with both interests.</p>\n<p>"Since the State has an urgent interest in the welfare of the child, it shares the parent\'s interest in an accurate and just decision" at the <em>factfinding</em> proceeding.  <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html#27">452 U. S. 27</a></span>.  As <em>parens patriae,</em> the State\'s goal is to provide the child with a permanent home.  <em>See</em> Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(a)(i) (statement of legislative findings and intent).  Yet while there is still reason to believe that positive, nurturing parent-child relationships exist, the <em>parens patriae</em> interest favors preservation, not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="767">Page 455 U. S. 767</a></p><p> severance, of natural familial bonds. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(a)(ii).  "[T]he State registers no gain towards its declared goals when it separates children from the custody of fit parents."  <em>Stanley v. Illinois,</em> 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/645/case.html#652">405 U. S. 652</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The State\'s interest in finding the child an alternative permanent home arises only "when it is <em>clear</em> that the natural parent cannot or will not provide a normal family home for the child."  Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(a)(iv) (emphasis added).  At the factfinding, that goal is served by procedures that promote an accurate determination of whether the natural parents can and will provide a normal home.</p>\n<p>Unlike a constitutional requirement of hearings, <em>see, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#347">424 U. S. 347</a></span>, or court-appointed counsel, a stricter standard of proof would reduce factual error without imposing substantial fiscal burdens upon the State.  As we have observed, 35 States already have adopted a higher standard by statute or court decision without apparent effect on the speed, form, or cost of their factfinding proceedings.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Nor would an elevated standard of proof create any real administrative burdens for the State\'s factfinders.  New York Family Court judges already are familiar with a higher evidentiary standard in other parental rights termination proceedings not involving permanent neglect.  <em>See</em> Soc.Serv.Law \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 384-b.3.(g), 384-b.4.(c), and 384-b.4.(e) (requiring "clear and convincing proof" before parental rights may be terminated for reasons of mental illness and mental retardation or severe and repeated child abuse).  New York also demands at least clear and convincing evidence in proceedings of far less moment than parental rights termination proceedings.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> N.Y.Veh. &amp; Traf.Law \xc2\xa7 227.1 (McKinney Supp.1981) (requiring the State to prove traffic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="768">Page 455 U. S. 768</a></p><p> infractions by "clear and convincing evidence") and <em>In re Rosenthal v. Hartnett,</em> 36 N.Y.2d 269 326 N.E.2d 811 (1975); <em>see also Ross v. Food Specialties, Inc.,</em> 6 N.Y.2d 336, 341, 160 N.E.2d 618, 620 (1959) (requiring "clear, positive and convincing evidence" for contract reformation).  We cannot believe that it would burden the State unduly to require that its factfinders have the same factual certainty when terminating the parent-child relationship as they must have to suspend a driver\'s license.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The logical conclusion of this balancing process is that the "fair preponderance of the evidence" standard prescribed by Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 622 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The Court noted in <em>Addington:</em></p>\n<p>"The individual should not be asked to share equally with society the risk of error when the possible injury to the individual is significantly greater than any possible harm to the state."</p>\n<p>441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#427">441 U. S. 427</a></span>.  Thus, at a parental rights termination proceeding, a near-equal allocation of risk between the parents and the State is constitutionally intolerable.  The next question, then, is whether a "beyond a reasonable doubt" or a "clear and convincing" standard is constitutionally mandated.</p>\n<p>In <em>Addington,</em> the Court concluded that application of a reasonable doubt standard is inappropriate in civil commitment proceedings for two reasons -- because of our hesitation to apply that unique standard "too broadly or casually in noncriminal cases," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#428">441 U. S. 428</a></span>, and because the psychiatric evidence ordinarily adduced at commitment proceedings is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 455 U. S. 769</a></p><p> rarely susceptible to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#429">441 U. S. 429</a></span>-430,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/424/case.html#432">449 U. S. 432</a></span>-433.  To be sure, as has been noted above, in the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, Pub.L. 9508, \xc2\xa7 102(f), 92 Stat. 3072, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1912(f) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), Congress requires "evidence beyond a reasonable doubt" for termination of Indian parental rights, reasoning that "the removal of a child from the parents is a penalty as great [as], if not greater, than a criminal penalty. . . ."  H.R.Rep. No. 95-1386, p. 22 (1978).  Congress did not consider, however, the evidentiary problems that would arise if proof beyond a reasonable doubt were required in all state-initiated parental rights termination hearings.</p>\n<p>Like civil commitment hearings, termination proceedings often require the factfinder to evaluate medical and psychiatric testimony, and to decide issues difficult to prove to a level of absolute certainty, such as lack of parental motive, absence of affection between parent and child, and failure of parental foresight and progress.  <em>Cf. Lassiter v. Department of Social Services,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html#30">452 U. S. 30</a></span>; <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/case.html#44">452 U. S. 44</a></span>-46 (first dissenting opinion) (describing issues raised in state termination proceedings).  The substantive standards applied vary from State to State.  Although Congress found a "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard proper in one type of parental rights termination case, another legislative body might well conclude that a reasonable doubt standard would erect an unreasonable barrier to state efforts to free permanently neglected children for adoption.</p>\n<p>A majority of the States have concluded that a "clear and convincing evidence" standard of proof strikes a fair balance between the rights of the natural parents and the State\'s legitimate concerns.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em>  We hold that such a standard adequately conveys to the factfinder the level of subjective certainty about his factual conclusions necessary to satisfy due process.  We further hold that determination of the precise burden equal to or greater than that standard </p><p><a class="page-number" name="770">Page 455 U.

After a factfinding hearing, the Family Court Judge dismissed respondent\'s petition for failure to prove an essential element of Fam.Ct.Act \xc2\xa7 614.1.(d).  <em>See In re Santosky,</em> 89 Misc.2d 730, 393 N.Y.S.2d 486 (1977).  The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed, finding that "the record as a whole" revealed that petitioners had "substantially planned for the future of the children."  <em>In re John W.,</em> 63 App.Div.2d 750, 751, 404 N.Y.S.2d 717, 719 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Since respondent Kramer took custody of Tina, John III, and Jed, the Santoskys have had two other children, James and Jeremy.

But today\'s decision certainly moves us in that direction.  By parsing the New York scheme and holding one narrow provision unconstitutional, the majority invites further federal court intrusion into every facet of state family law.  If ever there were an area in which federal courts should heed the admonition of Justice Holmes that "a page of history is worth a volume of logic," [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] it is in the area of domestic relations.  This area has been left to the States from time immemorial, and not without good reason.</p>\n<p>Equally as troubling is the majority\'s due process analysis.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that a State will treat individuals with "fundamental fairness" whenever its actions infringe their protected liberty or property interests.  By adoption of the procedures relevant to this case, New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 455 U.

For all of our experience in this area, we have found no fully satisfactory solutions to the painful problem of child abuse and neglect.  We have found, however, that leaving the States free to experiment with various remedies has produced novel approaches and promising progress.</p>\n<p>Throughout this experience, the Court has scrupulously refrained from interfering with state answers to domestic relations questions.</p>\n<p>"Both theory and the precedents of this Court teach us solicitude for state interests, particularly in the field of family and family property arrangements."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

As will be seen more fully in the next part, New York has enacted a comprehensive plan to <em>aid</em> marginal parents in regaining the custody of their child.  The central purpose of the New York plan is to reunite divided families.  Adoption of the preponderance of the evidence standard represents New York\'s good faith effort to balance the interest of parents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="772">Page 455 U.

[<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority may believe that it is adopting a relatively unobtrusive means of ensuring that termination proceedings provide "due process of law."  In fact, however, fixing the standard of proof as a matter of federal constitutional law will only lead to further federal court intervention in state schemes.  By holding that due process requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, the majority surely cannot mean that any state scheme passes constitutional muster so long as it applies that standard of proof.  A state law permitting termination of parental rights upon a showing of neglect by clear and convincing evidence certainly would not be acceptable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="773">Page 455 U. S. 773</a></p><p> to the majority if it provided no procedures other than one 30-minute hearing.  Similarly, the majority probably would balk at a state scheme that permitted termination of parental rights on a clear and convincing showing merely that such action would be in the best interests of the child.  <em>See Smith v . Organization of Foster Families,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/816/case.html">431 U.

Having in this case abandoned evaluation of the overall effect of a scheme, and with it the possibility of finding that strict substantive standards or special procedures compensate for a lower burden of proof, the majority\'s approach will inevitably lead to the federalization of family law.  Such a trend will only thwart state searches for better solutions in an area where this Court should encourage state experimentation.</p>\n<p>"It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.

During the next four and one-half years, those three children were in the custody of the State and in the care of foster homes or institutions, and the State was diligently engaged in efforts to prepare petitioners for the children\'s return.  Those efforts were unsuccessful, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 455 U. S. 774</a></p><p> however, and, on April 10, 1979, the New York Family Court for Ulster County terminated petitioners\' parental rights as to the three children removed in 1974 or earlier.  This termination was preceded by a judicial finding that petitioners had failed to plan for the return and future of their children, a statutory category of permanent neglect.  Petitioners now contend, and the Court today holds, that they were denied due process of law not because of a general inadequacy of procedural protections, but simply because the finding of permanent neglect was made on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence adduced at the termination hearing.</p>\n<p>It is well settled that</p>\n<p>"[t]he requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment\'s protection of liberty and property."</p>\n<p><em>Board of Regents v.

The adequacy of a scheme of procedural protections cannot, therefore, be determined merely by the application of general principles unrelated to the peculiarities of the case at hand.</p>\n<p>Given this flexibility, it is obvious that a proper due process inquiry cannot be made by focusing upon one narrow provision of the challenged statutory scheme.  Such a focus threatens to overlook factors which may introduce constitutionally adequate protections into a particular government action.  Courts must examine <em>all</em> procedural protections offered by the State, and must assess the <em>cumulative</em> effect of such safeguards.  As we have stated before, courts must consider "the fairness and reliability of the existing . . . procedures" before holding that the Constitution requires more.  <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/case.html#343">424 U. S. 343</a></span>.  Only through such a broad inquiry may courts determine whether a challenged governmental action satisfies the due process requirement of "fundamental fairness." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  In some instances, the Court has even looked to nonprocedural restraints on official action in determining whether the deprivation of a protected interest was effected without due process of law.  <em>E.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/651/case.html">430 U.

[<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The termination of parental rights on the basis of permanent neglect can occur under New York law only by order of the Family Court.  N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law (SSL) \xc2\xa7 384-b.3.(d) (McKinney Supp.1981-1982).  Before a petition for permanent termination can be filed in that court, however, several other events must first occur.</p>\n<p>The Family Court has jurisdiction only over those children who are in the care of an authorized agency.  N.Y. Family Court Act (FCA) \xc2\xa7 614.1.(b) (McKinney 1975 and Supp.1981-1982).  Therefore, the children who are the subject of a termination petition must previously have been removed from their parents\' home on a temporary basis.  Temporary removal of a child can occur in one of two ways.  The parents may consent to the removal, FCA \xc2\xa7 1021, or, as occurred in this case, the Family Court can order the removal pursuant to a finding that the child is abused or neglected.

Unless the court finds that exigent circumstances require removal of the child before a petition may be filed and a hearing held, <em>see</em> FCA \xc2\xa7 1022, the order of temporary removal results from a "dispositional hearing" conducted to determine the appropriate form of alternative care.  FCA \xc2\xa7 1045.  <em>See also</em> FCA \xc2\xa7 1055.

Thereafter, review may be sought in the New York Court of Appeals and, ultimately, in this Court if a federal question is properly presented.</p>\n<p>As this description of New York\'s termination procedures demonstrates, the State seeks not only to protect the interests of parents in rearing their own children, but also to assist and encourage parents who have lost custody of their children to reassume their rightful role.  Fully understood, the New York system is a comprehensive program to aid parents such as petitioners.  Only as a last resort, when "diligent efforts" to reunite the family have failed, does New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 455 U.

The procedures for termination of those relationships which cannot be aided and which threaten permanent injury to the child, administered by a judge who has supervised the case from the first temporary removal through the final termination, cannot be viewed as fundamentally unfair.  The facts of this case demonstrate the fairness of the system.</p>\n<p>The three children to which this case relates were removed from petitioners\' custody in 1973 and 1974, before petitioners\' other two children were born.  The removals were made pursuant to the procedures detailed above, and in response to what can only be described as shockingly abusive treatment. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  At the temporary removal hearing held before the Family Court on September 30, 1974, petitioners were represented by counsel, and allowed the Ulster County Department of Social Services (Department) to take custody of the three children.</p>\n<p>Temporary removal of the children was continued at an evidentiary hearing held before the Family Court in December, 1975, after which the court issued a written opinion concluding that petitioners were unable to resume their parental responsibilities due to personality disorders.  Unsatisfied with the progress petitioners were making, the court also directed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 455 U. S. 782</a></p><p> the Department to reduce to writing the plan which it had designed to solve the problems at petitioners\' home and reunite the family.</p>\n<p>A plan for providing petitioners with extensive counseling and training services was submitted to the court and approved in February, 1976.  Under the plan, petitioners received training by a mother\'s aide, a nutritional aide, and a public health nurse, and counseling at a family planning clinic.  In addition, the plan provided psychiatric treatment and vocational training for the father, and counseling at a family service center for the mother.  Brief for Respondent Kramer 1-7.  Between early 1976 and the final termination decision in April, 1979, the State spent more than $15,000 in these efforts to rehabilitate petitioners as parents.  App. 34.</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' response to the State\'s effort was marginal, at best.  They wholly disregarded some of the available services, and participated only sporadically in the others.  As a result, and out of growing concern over the length of the children\'s stay in foster care, the Department petitioned, in September, 1976, for permanent termination of petitioners\' parental rights so that the children could be adopted by other families.  Although the Family Court recognized that petitioners\' reaction to the State\'s efforts was generally "nonresponsive, even hostile," the fact that they were "at least superficially cooperative" led it to conclude that there was yet hope of further improvement and an eventual reuniting of the family.  Exhibit to Brief for Respondent Kramer 618.  Accordingly, the petition for permanent termination was dismissed.</p>\n<p>Whatever progress petitioners were making prior to the 1976 termination hearing, they made little or no progress thereafter.  In October, 1978, the Department again filed a termination petition alleging that petitioners had completely failed to plan for the children\'s future despite the considerable efforts rendered in their behalf.  This time, the Family Court agreed.  The court found that petitioners had</p>\n<p>"failed in any meaningful way to take advantage of the many social </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 455 U. S. 783</a></p><p> and rehabilitative services that have not only been made available to them but have been diligently urged upon them."</p>\n<p>App. 35.  In addition, the court found that the "infrequent" visits "between the parents and their children were, at best, superficial, and devoid of any real emotional content."  <em>Id.</em> at 21.  The court thus found</p>\n<p>"nothing in the situation which holds out any hope that [petitioners] may ever become financially self sufficient or emotionally mature enough to be independent of the services of social agencies.  More than a reasonable amount of time has passed, and still, in the words of the case workers, there has been no discernible forward movement.  At some point in time, it must be said, \'enough is enough.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 36.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the statutory requirements set forth above, the court found that petitioners\' failure to plan for the future of their children, who were then seven, five, and four years old and had been out of petitioners\' custody for at least four years, rose to the level of permanent neglect.  At a subsequent dispositional hearing, the court terminated petitioners\' parental rights, thereby freeing the three children for adoption.</p>\n<p>As this account demonstrates, the State\'s extraordinary 4-year effort to reunite petitioners\' family was not just unsuccessful, it was altogether rebuffed by parents unwilling to improve their circumstances sufficiently to permit a return of their children.  At every step of this protracted process, petitioners were accorded those procedures and protections which traditionally have been required by due process of law.  Moreover, from the beginning to the end of this sad story, all judicial determinations were made by one Family Court Judge.  After four and one-half years of involvement with petitioners, more than seven complete hearings, and additional periodic supervision of the State\'s rehabilitative efforts, the judge no doubt was intimately familiar with this case and the prospects for petitioners\' rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>It is inconceivable to me that these procedures were "fundamentally unfair" to petitioners.  Only by its obsessive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 455 U. S. 784</a></p><p> focus on the standard of proof and its almost complete disregard of the facts of this case does the majority find otherwise. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  As the discussion above indicates, however, such a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 455 U.

The standard of proof</p>\n<p>"represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication."</p>\n<p><em>In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U.

S. 344</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In determining the propriety of a particular standard of proof in a given case, however, it is not enough simply to say that we are trying to minimize the risk of error.  Because errors in factfinding affect more than one interest, we try to minimize error as to those interests which we consider to be most important.  As Justice Harlan explained in his well known concurrence to <em>In re Winship:</em></p>\n<p>"In a lawsuit between two parties, a factual error can make a difference in one of two ways.  First, it can result in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff when the true facts warrant a judgment for the defendant.  The analogue in a criminal case would be the conviction of an innocent man.  On the other hand, an erroneous factual determination can result in a judgment for the defendant when the true facts justify a judgment in plaintiff\'s favor.  The criminal analogue would be the acquittal of a guilty man."</p>\n<p>The standard of proof influences the relative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes.  If, for example, the standard of proof for a criminal trial were a preponderance of the evidence, rather than proof </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 455 U. S. 787</a></p><p> beyond a reasonable doubt, there would be a smaller risk of factual errors that result in freeing guilty persons, but a far greater risk of factual errors that result in convicting the innocent.  Because the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes, the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should, in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each.</p>\n<p>397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#370">397 U. S. 370</a></span>-371.</p>\n<p>When the standard of proof is understood as reflecting such an assessment, an examination of the interests at stake in a particular case becomes essential to determining the propriety of the specified standard of proof.  Because proof by a preponderance of the evidence requires that "[t]he litigants . . . share the risk of error in a roughly equal fashion," <em>Addington v. Texas, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/case.html#423">441 U. S. 423</a></span>, it rationally should be applied only when the interests at stake are of roughly equal societal importance.  The interests at stake in this case demonstrate that New York has selected a constitutionally permissible standard of proof.</p>\n<p>On one side is the interest of parents in a continuation of the family unit and the raising of their own children.  The importance of this interest cannot easily be overstated.  Few consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.  Even the convict committed to prison and thereby deprived of his physical liberty often retains the love and support of family members.</p>\n<p>"This Court\'s decisions have by now made plain beyond the need for multiple citation that a parent\'s desire for and right to \'the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children\' is an important interest that \'undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\'  <em>Stanley v.

In creating the scheme at issue in this case, the New York Legislature </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 455 U.

[<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  A stable, loving </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 455 U. S. 789</a></p><p> home life is essential to a child\'s physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing.  It requires no citation of authority to assert that children who are abused in their youth generally face extraordinary problems developing into responsible, productive citizens.  The same can be said of children who, though not physically or emotionally abused, are passed from one foster home to another with no constancy of love, trust, or discipline.  If the Family Court makes an incorrect factual determination resulting in a failure to terminate a parent-child relationship which rightfully should be ended, the child involved must return either to an abusive home [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] or to the often unstable world of foster care. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  The reality of these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 455 U. S. 790</a></p><p> risks is magnified by the fact that the only families faced with termination actions are those which have voluntarily surrendered custody of their child to the State, or, as in this case, those from which the child has been removed by judicial action because of threatened irreparable injury through abuse or neglect.  Permanent neglect findings also occur only in families where the child has been in foster care for at least one year.</p>\n<p>In addition to the child\'s interest in a normal home life, "the State has an urgent interest in the welfare of the child."  <em>Lassiter v.

S. 791</a></p><p> nurturing home life are balanced against the interests of the parents in the rearing of their child, it cannot be said that either set of interests is so clearly paramount as to require that the risk of error be allocated to one side or the other.  Accordingly, a State constitutionally may conclude that the risk of error should be borne in roughly equal fashion by use of the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.  <em>See Addington v.

This is precisely the balance which has been struck by the New York Legislature:</p>\n<p>"It is the intent of the legislature in enacting this section to provide procedures not only assuring that the rights of the natural parent are protected, but also, where positive, nurturing parent-child relationships no longer exist, furthering the best interests, needs, and rights of the child by terminating the parental rights and freeing the child for adoption."</p>\n<p>SSL \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(b).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>For the reasons heretofore stated, I believe that the Court today errs in concluding that the New York standard of proof in parental rights termination proceedings violates due process of law.  The decision disregards New York\'s earnest efforts to aid parents in regaining the custody of their children and a host of procedural protections placed around parental rights and interests.  The Court finds a constitutional violation only by a tunnel vision application of due process principles that altogether loses sight of the unmistakable fairness of the New York procedure.</p>\n<p>Even more worrisome, today\'s decision cavalierly rejects the considered judgment of the New York Legislature in an area traditionally entrusted to state care.  The Court thereby begins, I fear, a trend of federal intervention in state family law matters which surely will stifle creative responses to vexing problems.

To the extent that the majority seeks, by this statement, to place upon the federal judiciary the primary responsibility for deciding the appropriate standard of proof in state matters, it arrogates to itself a responsibility wholly at odds with the allocation of authority in our federalist system, and wholly unsupported by the prior decisions of this Court.  In <em>Woodby v. INS,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/276/case.html">385 U.

Beyond an examination for the constitutional minimum of "fundamental fairness" -- which clearly is satisfied by the New York procedures at issue in this case -- this Court simply has no role in establishing the standards of proof that States must follow in the various judicial proceedings they afford to their citizens.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Although, as the majority states, we have held that the minimum requirements of procedural due process are a question of federal law, such a holding does not mean that the procedural protections afforded by a State will be inadequate under the Fourteenth Amendment.

I differ, therefore, not with the majority\'s statement that the requirements of due process present a federal question, but with its apparent assumption that the presence of "fundamental fairness" can be ascertained by an examination which completely disregards the plethora of protective procedures accorded parents by New York law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority refuses to consider New York\'s procedure as a whole, stating that</p>\n<p>"[t]he statutory provision of right to counsel and multiple hearings before termination cannot suffice to protect a natural parent\'s fundamental liberty interests if the State is willing to tolerate undue uncertainty in the determination of the dispositive facts."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#758">455 U.

Implicit in this statement is the conclusion that the risk of error may be reduced to constitutionally tolerable levels only by raising the standard of proof -- that other procedures can never eliminate "undue uncertainty" so long as the standard of proof remains too low.

The "unusual" discretion of the Family Court judge to consider the "<em>affectio[n] and concer[n]\'" displayed by parents during visits with their children, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#763">455 U. S. 763</a></span>, n. 12, is nothing more than discretion to consider reality; there is not one shred of evidence in this case suggesting that the determination of the Family Court was "based on cultural or class bias"; if parents lack the "ability to mount a defense," the State provides them with the full services of an attorney, FCA \xc2\xa7 262, and they, like the State, have "full access to all <em>public</em> records concerning the family" (emphasis added); and the absence of "double jeopardy" protection simply recognizes the fact that family problems are often ongoing, and may in the future warrant action that currently is unnecessary.  In this case, the Family Court dismissed the first termination petition because it desired to give petitioners "the benefit of the doubt," Exhibit to Brief for Respondent Kramer 620, and a second opportunity to raise themselves to "an acceptable minimal level of competency as parents."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/624/case.html">455 U. S. 624</a></span>.  It was their complete failure to do so that prompted the second, successful termination petition.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#781">455 U.

In the usual adjudicatory setting, the factfinder has had little or no prior exposure to the facts of the case.  His only knowledge of those facts comes from the evidence adduced at trial, and he renders his findings solely upon the basis of that evidence.  Thus, normally, the standard of proof is a crucial factor in the final outcome of the case, for it is the scale upon which the factfinder weighs his knowledge and makes his decision.</p>\n<p>Although the standard serves the same function in New York parental termination proceedings, additional assurances of accuracy are present in its application.  As was adduced at oral argument, the practice in New York is to assign one judge to supervise a case from the initial temporary removal of the child to the final termination of parental rights.  Therefore, as discussed above, the factfinder is intimately familiar with the case before the termination proceedings ever begin.  Indeed, as in this case, he often will have been closely involved in protracted efforts to rehabilitate the parents.  Even if a change in judges occurs, the Family Court retains jurisdiction of the case, and the newly assigned judge may take judicial notice of all prior proceedings.  Given this familiarity with the case, and the necessarily lengthy efforts which must precede a termination action in New York, decisions in termination cases are made by judges steeped in the background of the case and peculiarly able to judge the accuracy of evidence placed before them.  This does not mean that the standard of proof in these cases can escape due process scrutiny, only that additional assurances of accuracy attend the application of the standard in New York termination proceedings.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/13" name="F2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority dismisses the child\'s interest in the accuracy of determinations made at the factfinding hearing because "[t]he factfinding does not purport . . . to balance the child\'s interest in a normal family home against the parents\' interest in raising the child," but instead "pits the State directly against the parents."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#759">455 U. S. 759</a></span>.  Only "[a]fter the State has established parental unfitness," the majority reasons, may the court "assume . . . that the interests of the child and the natural parents do diverge."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/745/case.html#760">455 U. S. 760</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This reasoning misses the mark.  The child has an interest in the outcome of the factfinding hearing independent of that of the parent.  To be sure, "the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing <em>erroneous</em> termination of their natural relationship."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  But the child\'s interest in a continuation of the family unit exists only to the extent that such a continuation would not be harmful to him.  An error in the factfinding hearing that results in a failure to terminate a parent-child relationship which rightfully should be terminated may well detrimentally affect the child.  <em>See</em> nn. <l=|455 14|="" 745fn2="" u.s.="">14, <l=|455 15|="" 745fn2="" u.s.="">15, <em>infra.</em></l=|455></l=|455></p>\n<p>The preponderance of the evidence standard, which allocates the risk of error more or less evenly, is employed when the social disutility of error <em>in either direction</em> is roughly equal -- that is, when an incorrect finding of fault would produce consequences as undesirable as the consequences that would be produced by an incorrect finding of no fault.  Only when the disutility of error in one direction discernibly outweighs the disutility of error in the other direction do we choose, by means of the standard of proof, to reduce the likelihood of the more onerous outcome.  <em>See In re Winship,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">397 U. S. 358</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html#370">397 U. S. 370</a></span>-372 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>New York\'s adoption of the preponderance of the evidence standard reflects its conclusion that the undesirable consequence of an erroneous finding of parental unfitness -- the unwarranted termination of the family relationship -- is roughly equal to the undesirable consequence of an erroneous finding of parental fitness -- the risk of permanent injury to the child either by return of the child to an abusive home or by the child\'s continued lack of a permanent home.  <em>See</em> nn. <l=|455 14|="" 745fn2="" u.s.="">14, <l=|455 15|="" 745fn2="" u.s.="">15, <em>infra.</em>  Such a conclusion is well within the province of state legislatures.  It cannot be said that the New York procedures are unconstitutional simply because a majority of the Members of this Court disagree with the New York Legislature\'s weighing of the interests of the parents and the child in an error-free factfinding hearing.</l=|455></l=|455></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/14" name="F2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]</p>\n<p>The record in this case illustrates the problems that may arise when a child is returned to an abusive home.  Eighteen months after Tina, petitioners\' oldest child, was first removed from petitioners\' home, she was returned to the home on a trial basis.  Katherine Weiss, a supervisor in the Child Protective Unit of the Ulster County Child Welfare Department, later testified in Family Court that "[t]he attempt to return Tina to her home just totally blew up."  Exhibit to Brief for Respondent Kramer 135.  When asked to explain what happened, Mrs. Weiss testified that</p>\n<p>"there were instances on the record in this court of Mr. Santosky\'s abuse of his wife, alleged abuse of the children, and proven neglect of the children."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Tina again was removed from the home, this time along with John and Jed.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/15" name="F2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>The New York Legislature recognized the potential harm to children of extended, nonpermanent foster care.  It found</p>\n<p>"that many children who have been placed in foster care experience unnecessarily protracted stays in such care without being adopted or returned to their parents or other custodians.  Such unnecessary stays may deprive these children of positive, nurturing family relationships and have deleterious effects on their development into responsible, productive citizens."</p>\n<p>SSL \xc2\xa7 384-b.1.(b).  Subsequent studies have proved this finding correct.  One commentator recently wrote of "the lamentable conditions of many foster care placements" under the New York system even today.  He noted:</p>\n<p>"Over fifty percent of the children in foster care have been in this "</p>\n<p>"temporary" status for more than two years; over thirty percent for more than five years.  During this time, many children are placed in a sequence of ill-suited foster homes, denying them the consistent support and nurturing that they so desperately need.</p>\n<p>Besharov, State Intervention To Protect Children:  New York\'s Definition of "Child Abuse" and "Child Neglect," 26 N.Y.L.S.L.Rev. 723, 770-771 (1981) (footnotes omitted).  In this case, petitioners\' three children have been in foster care for more than four years, one child since he was only three days old.  Failure to terminate petitioners\' parental rights will only mean a continuation of this unsatisfactory situation.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/16" name="F2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority\'s conclusion that a state interest in the child\'s wellbeing arises only after a determination of parental unfitness suffers from the same error as its assertion that the child has no interest, separate from that of its parents, in the accuracy of the factfinding hearing.  <em>See</em> <l=|455 13|="" 745fn2="" u.s.="">n. 13, <em>supra.</em></l=|455></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
