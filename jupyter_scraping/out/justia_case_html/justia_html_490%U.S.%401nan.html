[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  These generally permit an inmate to subscribe to, or to receive, a publication without prior approval, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] but authorize the warden to reject a publication in certain circumstances.  The warden may reject it "only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 490 U. S. 405</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 540.71(b).  The warden, however, may not reject a publication "solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The regulations contain a nonexhaustive list of criteria which may support rejection of a publication. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The warden is prohibited from establishing an excluded list of publications:  each issue of a subscription publication is to be reviewed separately.  \xc2\xa7 540.71(c).  The regulatory criteria for rejecting publications have been supplemented by Program Statement No. 5266.5, which provides further guidance on the subject of sexually explicit material.

The warden may designate staff to screen and, where appropriate, to approve incoming publications, but only the warden may reject a publication.  \xc2\xa7 540.70(b).  The warden must advise the inmate promptly in writing of the reasons for the rejection, \xc2\xa7 540.71(d), and must provide the publisher or sender with a copy of the rejection letter, \xc2\xa7 540.71(e).  The notice must refer to "the specific article(s) or material(s) considered objectionable."  \xc2\xa7 540.71(d).  The publisher or sender may obtain an independent review of the warden\'s rejection decision by a timely writing to the Regional Director of the Bureau.  \xc2\xa7 540.71(e).

It is equally certain that "[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution," <em>Turner v. Safley,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#84">482 U. S. 84</a></span>, nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the "inside," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#94">482 U. S. 94</a></span>-99; <em>Bell v. Wolfish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html">441 U. S. 520</a></span> (1979); <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\' Labor Union, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/119/case.html">433 U. S. 119</a></span> (1977); <em>Pell v. Procunier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/817/case.html">417 U. S. 817</a></span> (1974).  We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the "inordinately difficult undertaking" that is modern prison administration.  @Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#85">482 U. S. 85</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In particular, we have been sensitive to the delicate balance that prison administrators must strike between the order and security of the internal prison environment and the legitimate demands of those on the "outside" who seek to enter that environment, in person or through the written word.  Many categories of noninmates seek access to prisons.  Access is essential to lawyers and legal assistants representing prisoner clients, <em>see Procunier v. Martinez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html">416 U. S. 396</a></span> (1974), to journalists seeking information about prison conditions, <em>see Pell v. Procunier, supra,</em> and to families and friends of prisoners who seek to sustain relationships with them, <em>see Procunier v. Martinez, supra.</em>  All these claims to prison access undoubtedly are legitimate; yet prison officials may well conclude that certain proposed interactions, though seemingly innocuous to laymen, have potentially significant implications for the order and security of the prison.  Acknowledging the expertise of these officials and that the judiciary is "ill equipped" to deal with the difficult </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 490 U. S. 408</a></p><p> and delicate problems of prison management, this Court has afforded considerable deference to the determinations of prison administrators who, in the interest of security, regulate the relations between prisoners and the outside world.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#404">416 U. S. 404</a></span>-405.</p>\n<p>In this case, there is no question that publishers who wish to communicate with those who, through subscription, willingly seek their point of view have a legitimate First Amendment interest in access to prisoners.  The question here, as it has been in our previous First Amendment cases in this area, is what standard of review this Court should apply to prison regulations limiting that access.</p>\n<p><em>Martinez</em> was our first significant decision regarding First Amendment rights in the prison context.  There, the Court struck down California regulations concerning personal correspondence between inmates and noninmates, regulations that provided for censorship of letters that "unduly complain," "magnify grievances," or "expres[s] inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views or beliefs."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#399">416 U. S. 399</a></span>.  We reviewed these regulations under the following standard:</p>\n<p>"First, the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.  Prison officials . . . must show that a regulation authorizing mail censorship furthers one or more of the substantial governmental interests of security, order, and rehabilitation.  Second, the limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.  Thus, a restriction on inmate correspondence that furthers an important or substantial interest of penal administration will nevertheless be invalid if its sweep is unnecessarily broad."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#413">416 U. S. 413</a></span>-414. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 490 U. S. 409</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is clear from this language, however, that we did not deprive prison officials of the degree of discretion necessary to vindicate "the particular governmental interest involved."  Accordingly, we said:</p>\n<p>"Some latitude in anticipating the probable consequences of allowing certain speech in a prison environment is essential to the proper discharge of an administrator\'s duty.  But any regulation or practice that restricts inmate correspondence must be generally necessary to protect one or more . . . legitimate governmental interests."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#414">416 U. S. 414</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s subsequent decisions regarding First Amendment rights in the prison context, however, laid down a different standard of review from that articulated in <em>Martinez.</em>  As recently explained in <em>Turner,</em> these later decisions, which we characterized as involving "prisoners\' rights," adopted a standard of review that focuses on the reasonableness of prison regulations:  the relevant inquiry is whether the actions of prison officials were "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests."  482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U. S. 89</a></span>.  The Court ruled that</p>\n<p>"such a standard is necessary if \'prison administrators . . . and not the courts, [are] to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.,</em> quoting <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\' Labor Union,</em> Inc., 433 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/119/case.html#128">433 U. S. 128</a></span>.  The Court set forth in <em>Turner</em> the development of this reasonableness standard in the respective decisions in <em>Pell</em> and <em>Jones</em> and in <em>Block v. Rutherford,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/576/case.html">468 U. S. 576</a></span> (1984), and we need not repeat that discussion here.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases, rather than <em>Martinez</em>\' less deferential approach, stemmed from its concern that language in <em>Martinez</em> might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of "strict" or "heightened" scrutiny, and that such a strict </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 490 U. S. 410</a></p><p> standard simply was not appropriate for consideration of regulations that are centrally concerned with the maintenance of order and security within prisons. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>See Turner v. Safley,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#81">482 U. S. 81</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#87">482 U. S. 87</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U. S. 89</a></span>.  Specifically, the Court declined to apply the <em>Martinez</em> standard in "prisoners\' rights" cases because, as was noted in <em>Turner,</em> <em>Martinez</em> could be (and had been) read to require a strict "least restrictive alternative" analysis, without sufficient sensitivity to the need for discretion in meeting legitimate prison needs.  482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U. S. 89</a></span>-90.  The Court expressed concern that</p>\n<p>"every administrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 490 U. S. 411</a></p><p> of solving the problem at hand,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U. S. 89</a></span>, and rejected the costs of a "least restrictive alternative" rule as too high.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>.  <em>See also O\'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/case.html">482 U. S. 342</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/case.html#350">482 U. S. 350</a></span> (1987) (refusing to apply a least restrictive alternative standard for regulation of prisoner work rules having an impact on religious observance).</p>\n<p>We do not believe that <em>Martinez</em> should, or need, be read as subjecting the decisions of prison officials to a strict "least restrictive means" test.  As noted, <em>Martinez</em> required no more than that a challenged regulation be "generally necessary" to a legitimate governmental interest.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#414">416 U. S. 414</a></span>.  Certainly, <em>Martinez</em> required a close fit between the challenged regulation and the interest it purported to serve.  But a careful reading of <em>Martinez</em> suggests that our rejection of the regulation at issue resulted not from a least restrictive means requirement, but from our recognition that the regulated activity centrally at issue in that case -- outgoing personal correspondence from prisoners -- did not, by its very nature, pose a serious threat to prison order and security. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We pointed out in <em>Martinez</em> that outgoing correspondence that magnifies grievances or contains inflammatory racial views cannot reasonably be expected to present a danger to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="412">Page 490 U.

In addition, the implications for security are far more predictable.  Dangerous outgoing correspondence is more likely to fall within readily identifiable categories:  examples noted in <em>Martinez</em> include escape plans, plans relating to ongoing criminal activity, and threats of blackmail or extortion.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#412">416 U.

Although we were careful in <em>Martinez</em> not to limit unduly the discretion of prison officials to reject even outgoing letters, we concluded that the regulations at issue were broader than "generally necessary" to protect the interests at stake.  416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#414">416 U. S. 414</a></span>. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of these considerations, it is understandable that the Court in <em>Martinez</em> concluded that the regulations there at issue swept too broadly.  Where, as in <em>Martinez,</em> the nature of the asserted governmental interest is such as to require a lesser degree of case-by-case discretion, a closer fit between the regulation and the purpose it serves may safely be required.  Categorically different considerations -- considerations far more typical of the problems of prison administration -- apply to the case presently before this Court.</p>\n<p>We deal here with incoming publications, material requested by an individual inmate but targeted to a general audience.  Once in the prison, material of this kind reasonably may be expected to circulate among prisoners, with the concomitant potential for coordinated disruptive conduct.  Furthermore, prisoners may observe particular material in the possession of a fellow prisoner, draw inferences about their fellow\'s beliefs, sexual orientation, or gang affiliations from that material, and cause disorder by acting accordingly.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 490 U. S. 413</a></p><p> <em>See</em> App. 22-23, 52, 59, 88; <em>see generally</em> Prisoners and the Law 3-14 (I. Robbins ed.1988) (noting that possession of homosexually explicit material may identify the possessor as homosexual and target him for assault).  As the Deputy Solicitor General noted at oral argument:  "The problem is not . . . in the individual reading the materials in most cases.  The problem is in the material getting into the prison."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.  <em>See also id.</em> at 26; App. 10.  In the volatile prison environment, it is essential that prison officials be given broad discretion to prevent such disorder.</p>\n<p>In <em>Turner,</em> we dealt with incoming personal correspondence from prisoners; the impact of the correspondence on the internal environment of the prison was of great concern.  There, we recognized that <em>Martinez</em> was too readily understood as failing to afford prison officials sufficient discretion to protect prison security.  In light of these same concerns, we now hold that regulations affecting the sending of a "publication" (see the regulations\' specific definition of this word,  <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra</em>) to a prisoner must be analyzed under the <em>Turner</em> reasonableness standard.  Such regulations are "valid if [they are] reasonably related to legitimate penological interests."  <em>Turner,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U. S. 89</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we acknowledge today that the logic of our analyses in <em>Martinez</em> and <em>Turner</em> requires that <em>Martinez</em> be limited to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence.  As we have observed, outgoing correspondence was the central focus of our opinion in <em>Martinez.</em>  The implications of outgoing correspondence for prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude than the implications of incoming materials.  Any attempt to justify a similar categorical distinction between incoming correspondence from prisoners (to which we applied a reasonableness standard in <em>Turner</em>) and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners would likely prove futile, and we do not invite it.  To the extent that <em>Martinez</em> itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule </p><p><a class="page-number" name="414">Page 490 U. S. 414</a></p><p> that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided <em>Turner.</em></p>\n<p>In so doing, we recognize that it might have been possible to apply a reasonableness standard to all incoming materials without overruling <em>Martinez:</em>  we instead could have made clear that <em>Martinez</em> does not uniformly require the application of a "least restrictive alternative" analysis.  We choose not to go that route, however, for we prefer the express flexibility of the <em>Turner</em> reasonableness standard.  We adopt the <em>Turner</em> standard in this case with confidence that, as petitioners here have asserted, "a reasonableness standard is not toothless."  Pet. for Cert. 17, n. 10.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Turner</em> identified several factors that are relevant to, and that serve to channel, the reasonableness inquiry.</p>\n<p>The first <em>Turner</em> factor is multifold:  we must determine whether the governmental objective underlying the regulations at issue is legitimate and neutral, and that the regulations are rationally related to that objective.  We agree with the District Court that this requirement has been met. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="415">Page 490 U. S. 415</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The legitimacy of the Government\'s purpose in promulgating these regulations is beyond question.  The regulations are expressly aimed at protecting prison security, a purpose this Court has said is "central to all other corrections goals."  <em>Pell v. Procunier,</em> 417 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/817/case.html#823">417 U. S. 823</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As to neutrality,</p>\n<p>"[w]e have found it important to inquire whether prison regulations restricting inmates\' First Amendment rights operated in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression."</p>\n<p><em>Turner,</em> 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>.  The ban on all correspondence between certain classes of inmates at issue in <em>Turner</em> clearly met this "neutrality" criterion, as did the restrictions at issue in <em>Pell</em> and <em>Wolfish.</em>  The issue, however, in this case is closer.</p>\n<p>On their face, the regulations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="416">Page 490 U. S. 416</a></p><p> distinguish between rejection of a publication "solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant" (prohibited) and rejection because the publication is detrimental to security (permitted).  28 CFR \xc2\xa7 540.71(b)(1988).  Both determinations turn, to some extent, on content.  But the Court\'s reference to "neutrality" in <em>Turner</em> was intended to go no further than its requirement in <em>Martinez</em> that</p>\n<p>"the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression."</p>\n<p>416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#413">416 U. S. 413</a></span>. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Where, as here, prison administrators draw distinctions between publications solely on the basis of their potential implications for prison security, the regulations are "neutral" in the technical sense in which we meant and used that term in <em>Turner.</em> [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>We also conclude that the broad discretion accorded prison wardens by the regulations here at issue is rationally related to security interests.  We reach this conclusion for two reasons.  The first has to do with the kind of security risk presented by incoming publications.  This has been explored above in Part III.  The District Court properly found that publications can present a security threat, and that a more closely tailored standard</p>\n<p>"could result in admission of publications which, even if they did not lead directly to violence, would exacerbate tensions and lead indirectly to disorder."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials into the prison, we agree with the District Court that a regulation which gives prison authorities broad discretion is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Second, we are comforted by the individualized nature of the determinations required by the regulation.  Under the regulations, no publication may be excluded unless the warden himself makes the determination that it is "detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or . . . might facilitate criminal activity."  28 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 540.70(b), 540.71(b) (1988).  This is the controlling standard.  A publication which fits within one of the "criteria" for exclusion may be rejected, but only if it is determined to meet that standard under the conditions prevailing at the institution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="417">Page 490 U. S. 417</a></p><p> at the time.  Indeed, the regulations expressly reject certain shortcuts that would lead to needless exclusions.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 540.70(b) (nondelegability of power to reject publications); \xc2\xa7 540.71(c) (prohibition against establishing an excluded list of publications).  We agree that it is rational for the Bureau to exclude materials that, although not necessarily "likely" to lead to violence, are determined by the warden to create an intolerable risk of disorder under the conditions of a particular prison at a particular time. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>A second factor the Court in <em>Turner</em> held to be</p>\n<p>"relevant in determining the reasonableness of a prison restriction . . . is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates."</p>\n<p>482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>.  As has already been made clear in <em>Turner</em> and O\'Lone, "the right" in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively.  The Court in <em>Turner</em> did not require that prisoners be afforded other means of communicating with inmates at other institutions, 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#92">482 U. S. 92</a></span>, nor did it in <em>O\'Lone</em> require that there be alternative means of attending the Jumu\'ah religious ceremony, 482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/342/case.html#351">482 U. S. 351</a></span>.  Rather, it held in <em>Turner</em> that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="418">Page 490 U. S. 418</a></p><p> it was sufficient if other means of expression (not necessarily other means of communicating with inmates in other prisons) remained available, and, in <em>O\'Lone,</em> if prisoners were permitted to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies.  As the regulations at issue in the present case permit a broad range of publications to be sent, received, and read, this factor is clearly satisfied.</p>\n<p>The third factor to be addressed under the <em>Turner</em> analysis is the impact that accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on others (guards and inmates) in the prison.  482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>.  Here, the class of publications to be excluded is limited to those found potentially detrimental to order and security; the likelihood that such material will circulate within the prison raises the prospect of precisely the kind of "ripple effect" with which the Court in <em>Turner</em> was concerned.  Where, as here, the right in question "can be exercised only at the cost of significantly less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and other prisoners alike," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#92">482 U. S. 92</a></span>, the courts should defer to the "informed discretion of corrections officials," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>Turner</em> held:</p>\n<p>"[T]he existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable, but is an \'exaggerated response\' to prison concerns. . . .  But if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner\'s rights at <em>de minimis</em> cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard."</p>\n<p>482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#90">482 U. S. 90</a></span>-91.  We agree with the District Court that these regulations, on their face, are not an "exaggerated response" to the problem at hand:  no obvious, easy alternative has been established.</p>\n<p>Regarding the all-or-nothing rule, we analyze respondents\' proposed alternatives to that rule as alternative means of accommodating respondents\' asserted rights.  The District Court discussed the evidence and found, on the basis of testimony in the record, that petitioners\' fear that tearing out the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="419">Page 490 U. S. 419</a></p><p> rejected portions and admitting the rest of the publication would create more discontent than the current practice was "reasonably founded."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The Court of Appeals did not contest the District Court\'s factual finding as such, but ruled that upholding a practice merely because it is based upon "reasonably founded" fears is improper under <em>Martinez:</em>  the Court of Appeals held that this finding</p>\n<p>"conflicts with the holding of <em>Martinez</em> that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is \'generally necessary.\'"</p>\n<p>263 U.S.App.D.C. at 194, 824 F.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p>As we here do not apply the <em>Martinez</em> standard, we reject the Court of Appeals\' sole ground for questioning the District Court\'s findings in this respect.  In our view, when prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less restrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to greater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact selected was not an "exaggerated response" under <em>Turner.</em>  Furthermore, the administrative inconvenience of this proposed alternative is also a factor to be considered, and adds additional support to the District Court\'s conclusion that petitioners were not obligated to adopt it.  <em>See Wolfish,</em> 441 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html#549">441 U. S. 549</a></span>.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>In sum, we hold that <em>Turner</em>\'s reasonableness standard is to be applied to the regulations at issue in this case, and that those regulations are facially valid under that standard.  We agree with the remand for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  <em>See</em> 263 U.S.App.D.C. at 196, 824 F.2d at 1176.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="420">Page 490 U.

He requested medical aid of the guards.  After several hours of unheeded pleading, accompanied by complaints to the guards from fellow prisoners in the cell block, Jones became frantic.  Each breath was painful; each breath brought him closer to suffocation.  Finally, guards called the PA (physician\'s assistant) . . . who brought with him the broken respirator.  Finding the equipment unusable, the PA gave Jones an injection of the tranquilizer, thorazine, to calm him.  Treatment with a tranquilizer was unquestionably contraindicated by Jones\' medical condition.

This Court holds today that such <em>carte blanche</em> deference was improper, and remands for case-by-case review.  I agree with this aspect of the Court\'s decision.  I cannot agree, however, with either its holding that another finding of "reasonableness" will justify censorship or its premature approval of the Bureau\'s regulations.  These latter determinations upset precedent in a headlong rush to strip inmates of all but a vestige of free communication with the world beyond the prison gate.

As Justice Powell explained:</p>\n<p>"Whatever the status of a prisoner\'s claim to uncensored correspondence with an outsider, it is plain that the latter\'s interest is grounded in the First Amendment\'s guarantee of freedom of speech.

Those cases did involve communications between inmates and outsiders; however, as I shall demonstrate, their legal and factual foundations differed critically from those in <em>Martinez</em> or in this case.</p>\n<p>In <em>Pell v. Procunier,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/817/case.html">417 U.

The reporters\' assertion of a special right of access could not prevail, the Court explained, because the First Amendment does not give the media greater access to public events or institutions -- including prisons -- than it gives ordinary citizens.

Wolfish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html">441 U. S. 520</a></span> (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.  Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued.  Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them, but not from other outsiders.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html#549">441 U.

Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html#552">441 U. S. 552</a></span>, minimized the abridgment of outsiders\' rights.  The approval in <em>Wolfish</em> of greater protection for publishers than for individual citizens reinforces <em>Martinez\'s</em> view that the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners must be carefully weighed, and undermines the Court\'s approach today.</p>\n<p>Most recently, <em>Turner v. Safley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html">482 U. S. 78</a></span> (1987), confirmed the vitality of <em>Martinez</em> for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners.  The Court relied on the three interim "prisoners\' rights" cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#89">482 U.

But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that, "because the regulation may entail a <em>consequential </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 490 U.

Notwithstanding, today the Court abandons the premise on which <em>Martinez</em> was grounded.  This casual discarding of "<em>the secure foundation\'" of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law.  <em>See Runyon v. McCrary,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/case.html">427 U.

As I pointed out in my partial dissent in <em>Turner,</em> an</p>\n<p>"open-ended \'reasonableness\' standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners\' First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks, rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 490 U. S. 428</a></p><p> are needed to further an important governmental interest."</p>\n<p>482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#101">482 U. S. 101</a></span>, n. 1.</p>\n<p>To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the "Herculean obstacles" blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, <em>see Martinez,</em> 416 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#404">416 U. S. 404</a></span>, and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are "detrimental" to "security, good order, or discipline" or "might facilitate criminal activity" are impermissibly ambiguous.  <em>See Abbott v. Meese,</em> 263 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 193, 824 F.2d 1166, 1173 (1987).  The term "detrimental" invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators\' actions.  Similarly, "might facilitate" -- in contrast with "encourage" or "advocate" -- so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.</p>\n<p>Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners\' assertion that they need "broad discretion" to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/401/case.html#416">490 U. S. 416</a></span>.  This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are "reasonable" -- a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers\' rights than I believe the First Amendment requires.  As was JUSTICE BLACKMUN in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 490 U. S. 429</a></p><p> <em>Block v.

Some of the rejected publications may represent the sole medium for conveying and receiving a particular unconventional message; thus it is irrelevant that the regulations permit many other publications to be delivered to prisoners.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/396/case.html#417">416 U.

Nor is there any evidence that an incoming publication ever caused a disciplinary or security problem; indeed, some of the rejected publications were delivered to inmates in other prisons without incident.  <em>See</em> App. 60, 99, 116-117.  In sum, the record convinces me that, under either the <em>Martinez</em> standard or the more deferential "reasonableness" standard, these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 490 U. S. 431</a></p><p> regulations are an impermissibly exaggerated response to security concerns.  <em>Cf.

In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate.  The District Court, however, found that "defendants\' fears" that "such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice" were "reasonably founded."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the <em>Martinez</em> standard and held that</p>\n<p>"rejection of the balance is not \'generally necessary\' to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected."</p>\n<p>263 U.S.App.D.C. at 193-194, 824 F.2d at 1173-1174.</p>\n<p>In this Court, petitioners argue that, on remand, the Court of Appeals should conduct "a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case" to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is "reasonable."  Brief for Petitioners 31.  "The validity of that policy," they continue,</p>\n<p>"will depend, among other things, on the security and administrative justifications for that policy, the availability of alternative courses of action, and the costs and risks associated with employing those alternatives."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  It is remarkable that, after 16 years of litigation, petitioners have failed to develop an argument that tells us anything about the assumed security or administrative justification for this rule.  Even more remarkable is the Court\'s conclusion that, since it does not apply the <em>Martinez</em> standard, it need not examine the appropriateness of the District Court\'s finding </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 490 U. S. 432</a></p><p> that the rule was reasonable.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/401/case.html#419">490 U. S. 419</a></span>.  A review of the record reveals that the Court thus defers to "findings" of a security threat that even prison officials admitted to be nonexistent.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that delivery of only part of a publication would endanger prison security. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  Rather, the primary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 490 U. S. 433</a></p><p> justification advanced for the all-or-nothing rule was administrative convenience.  <em>See</em> App. 41, 68.  The Bureau has objected that a contrary rule "would mean defacing the material and laboriously going over each article in each publication. . . ."  44 Fed.Reg. 38258 (1979).  But general speculation that some administrative burden might ensue should not be sufficient to justify a meat-ax abridgment of the First Amendment rights of either a free citizen or a prison inmate.  It is difficult even to imagine such a burden in this instance:  if, as the regulations\' text seems to require, prison officials actually read an article before rejecting it, the incremental burden associated with clipping out the offending matter could not be of constitutional significance.  The Bureau\'s administrative convenience justification thus is insufficient as a matter of law under either the <em>Martinez</em> standard or a "reasonableness" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 490 U. S. 434</a></p><p> standard.  The District Court\'s contradictory finding simply highlights the likelihood that an attitude of broad judicial deference, coupled with a "reasonableness" standard, will provide inadequate protection for the rights at stake.

Application of the standard would seem to permit disregard for inmates\' constitutional rights whenever the imagination of the warden produces a plausible security concern and a deferential trial court is able to discern a logical connection between that concern and the challenged regulation.  Indeed, there is a logical connection between prison discipline and the use of bullwhips on prisoners; and security is logically furthered by a total ban on inmate communication, not only with other inmates but also with outsiders who conceivably might be interested in arranging an attack within the prison or an escape from it."</p>\n<p>482 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html#100">482 U.
