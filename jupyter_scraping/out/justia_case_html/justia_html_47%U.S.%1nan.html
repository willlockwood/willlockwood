CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case is brought up by writ of error directed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi upon a judgment obtained by the defendant in error against the plaintiff for the amount of four notes, dated May 2, 1835, endorsed by the plaintiff in error to the defendant, and also for one other note drawn by the former in favor of the latter, dated December 14, 1835.</p>\n<p>It appears by the record that three questions of law were raised at the trial, which are now before this Court upon the writ of error, the testimony as to the residence of the plaintiff upon the plea of <em>nonassumpsit</em> having been properly refused.</p>\n<p>The first point relied on as a defense to the action was that the notes above mentioned were all endorsed and delivered by Sims to Hundley in payment for slaves brought by Hundley into the State of Mississippi as merchandise, and there sold to Sims, and that the sale of slaves so brought into the state was prohibited by the Constitution of Mississippi, and the contract therefore illegal and void.</p>\n<p>This question was decided in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/40/449/case.html">Groves v.

And it is the settled law in this Court that contracts of this description, made at the time when these notes bear date, were valid and not prohibited by the Constitution of Mississippi.</p>\n<p>The point next in order is presented by the exception taken to the refusal of the court to continue the case to another term, upon the affidavit filed by the plaintiff in error.  But this point also has been long settled, and it has always been held in this Court that the continuance of a cause or the refusal to continue rests in the sound discretion of the court in which the motion is made, and cannot be reviewed by writ of error.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/10/206/case.html">Marine Ins.

This, however like the two preceding points, has been already decided by this Court, and this case cannot be distinguished from the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/127/case.html">Brandon v.
