I, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution without need for further justification if the population of the largest district is less than one percent greater than the population of the smallest district.  A three-judge District Court declared New Jersey\'s 1982 reapportionment plan unconstitutional on the authority of <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preisler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html">394 U. S. 526</a></span> (1969), and <em>White v. Weiser,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html">412 U. S. 783</a></span> (1973), because the population deviations among districts, although small, were not the result of a good faith effort to achieve population equality.  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>After the results of the 1980 decennial census had been tabulated, the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives notified the Governor of New Jersey that the number of Representatives to which the State was entitled had decreased from 15 to 14.  Accordingly, the New Jersey Legislature was required to reapportion the State\'s congressional districts.  The State\'s 199th Legislature passed two reapportionment bills.  One was vetoed by the Governor, and the second, although signed into law, occasioned significant dissatisfaction among those who felt it diluted minority voting strength in the city of Newark.  <em>See</em> App. 83-84, 86-90.  In response, the 200th Legislature returned to the problem of apportioning congressional districts when it convened in January, 1982, and it swiftly passed a bill (S-711) introduced by Senator Feldman, President <em>pro tem</em> of the State Senate, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="728">Page 462 U. S. 728</a></p><p> which created the apportionment plan at issue in this case.  The bill was signed by the Governor on January 19, 1982, becoming Pub.L.1982, ch. 1 (hereinafter Feldman Plan).  A map of the resulting apportionment is appended <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>Like every plan considered by the legislature, the Feldman Plan contained 14 districts, with an average population per district (as determined by the 1980 census) of 526,059. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Each district did not have the same population.  On the average, each district differed from the "ideal" figure by 0.1384%, or about 726 people.  The largest district, the Fourth District, which includes Trenton, had a population of 527,472, and the smallest, the Sixth District, embracing most of Middlesex County, a population of 523,798.  The difference between them was 3,674 people, or 0.6984% of the average district.  The populations of the other districts also varied.  The Ninth District, including most of Bergen County, in the northeastern corner of the State, had a population of 527,349, while the population of the Third District, along the Atlantic shore, was only 524,825.  App. 124.</p>\n<p>The legislature had before it other plans with appreciably smaller population deviations between the largest and smallest districts.  The one receiving the most attention in the District Court was designed by Dr. Ernest Reock, Jr, a political science professor at Rutgers University and Director of the Bureau of Government Research.  A version of the Reock </p><p><a class="page-number" name="729">Page 462 U. S. 729</a></p><p> Plan introduced in the 200th Legislature by Assemblyman Hardwick had a maximum population difference of 2,375, or 0.4514% of the average figure.  <em>Id.</em> at 133.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately after the Feldman Plan became law, a group of individuals with varying interests, including all incumbent Republican Members of Congress from New Jersey, sought a declaration that the apportionment plan violated Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and an injunction against proceeding with the primary election for United States Representatives under the plan.  A three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2284(a).  The District Court held a hearing on February 26, 1982, at which the parties submitted a number of depositions and affidavits, moved for summary judgment, and waived their right to introduce further evidence in the event the motions for summary judgment were denied.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the District Court issued an opinion and order declaring the Feldman Plan unconstitutional.  Denying the motions for summary judgment and resolving the case on the record as a whole, the District Court held that the population variances in the Feldman Plan were not "unavoidable despite a good faith effort to achieve absolute equality," <em>see Kirkpatrick, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#531">394 U. S. 531</a></span>.  The court rejected appellants\' argument that a deviation lower than the statistical imprecision of the decennial census was "the functional equivalent of mathematical equality."  <em>Daggett v. Kimmelman,</em> 535 F.Supp. 978, 982-983 (NJ 1982).  It also held that appellants had failed to show that the population variances were justified by the legislature\'s purported goals of preserving minority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="730">Page 462 U. S. 730</a></p><p> voting strength and anticipating shifts in population.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court enjoined appellants from conducting primary or general elections under the Feldman Plan, but that order was stayed pending appeal to this Court, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/1303/case.html">455 U. S. 1303</a></span> (1982) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers), and we noted probable jurisdiction, 457 U.S. 1131 (1982).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Article I, \xc2\xa7 2, establishes a "high standard of justice and common sense" for the apportionment of congressional districts:  "equal representation for equal numbers of people."  <em>Wesberry v.

S. 18</a></span> (1964).  Precise mathematical equality, however, may be impossible to achieve in an imperfect world; therefore, the "equal representation" standard is enforced only to the extent of requiring that districts be apportioned to achieve population equality "as nearly as is practicable."  <em>See id.</em> at 7-8, 18.  As we explained further in <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preiser:</em></p>\n<p>"[T]he \'as nearly as practicable\' standard requires that the State make a good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.  <em>See Reynolds v.

First, the court must consider whether the population differences among districts could have been reduced or eliminated altogether by a good faith effort to draw districts of equal population.  Parties challenging apportionment legislation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="731">Page 462 U. S. 731</a></p><p> must bear the burden of proof on this issue, and if they fail to show that the differences could have been avoided, the apportionment scheme must be upheld.  If, however, the plaintiffs can establish that the population differences were not the result of a good faith effort to achieve equality, the State must bear the burden of proving that each significant variance between districts was necessary to achieve some legitimate goal.  <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#532">394 U.

Adopting any standard other than population equality, using the best census data available, <em>see</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#532">394 U. S. 532</a></span>, would subtly erode the Constitution\'s ideal of equal representation.  If state legislators knew that a certain <em>de minimis</em> level of population differences was acceptable, they would doubtless strive to achieve that level, rather than equality. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="732">Page 462 U.

Furthermore, choosing a different standard would import a high degree of arbitrariness into the process of reviewing apportionment plans.  <em>Ibid.</em>  In this case, appellants argue that a maximum deviation of approximately 0.7% should be considered <em>de minimis.</em>  If we accept that argument, how are we to regard deviations of 0.8%, 0.95%, 1%, or 1.1%?</p>\n<p>Any standard, including absolute equality, involves a certain artificiality.  As appellants point out, even the census data are not perfect, and the well-known restlessness of the American people means that population counts for particular localities are outdated long before they are completed.  Yet problems with the data at hand apply equally to any population-based standard we could choose. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  As between two standards -- equality or something less than equality -- only the former reflects the aspirations of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2.</p>\n<p>To accept the legitimacy of unjustified, though small, population deviations in this case would mean to reject the basic premise of <em>Kirkpatrick</em> and <em>Wesberry.</em>  We decline appellants\' invitation to go that far.  The unusual rigor of their standard has been noted several times.  Because of that rigor, we have required that absolute population equality be the paramount objective of apportionment only in the case of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="733">Page 462 U. S. 733</a></p><p> congressional districts, for which the command of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, as regards the National Legislature outweighs the local interests that a State may deem relevant in apportioning districts for representatives to state and local legislatures, but we have not questioned the population equality standard for congressional districts.  <em>See, e.g., White v.

S. 735</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The sole difference between appellants\' theory and the argument we rejected in <em>Kirkpatrick</em> is that appellants have proposed a <em>de minimis</em> line that gives the illusion of rationality and predictability:  the "inevitable statistical imprecision of the census."  They argue:</p>\n<p>"Where, as here, the deviation from ideal district size is less than the known imprecision of the census figures, that variation is the functional equivalent of zero."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellants 18.  There are two problems with this approach.  First, appellants concentrate on the extent to which the census systematically undercounts actual population -- a figure which is not known precisely and which, even if it were known, would not be relevant to this case.  Second, the mere existence of statistical imprecision does not make small deviations among districts the functional equivalent of equality.</p>\n<p>In the District Court and before this Court, appellants rely exclusively on an affidavit of Dr. James Trussell, a Princeton University demographer.  <em>See</em> App. 97-104.  Dr. Trussell\'s carefully worded statement reviews various studies of the undercounts in the 1950, 1960, and 1970 decennial censuses, and it draws three important conclusions:  (1) "the undercount in the 1980 census is likely to be above one percent"; (2) "all the evidence to date indicates that all places are not undercounted to the same extent, since the undercount rate has been shown to depend on race, sex, age, income, and education"; and (3) "[t]he distribution of the undercount in New Jersey is . . . unknown, and I see no reason to believe that it would be uniformly spread over all municipalities."  <em>Id.</em> at 103-104.  Assuming for purposes of argument that each of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="736">Page 462 U. S. 736</a></p><p> these statements is correct, they do not support appellants\' argument.</p>\n<p>In essence, appellants\' one percent benchmark is little more than an attempt to present an attractive <em>de minimis</em> line with a patina of scientific authority.  Neither Dr. Trussell\'s statement nor any of appellants\' other evidence specifies a precise level for the undercount in New Jersey, and Dr. Trussell\'s discussion of the census makes clear that it is impossible to develop reliable estimates of the undercount on anything but a nationwide scale.  <em>See id.</em> at 98-101.  His conclusion that the 1980 undercount is "likely to be above one percent" seems to be based on the undercounts in previous censuses and a guess as to how well new procedures adopted in 1980 to reduce the undercount would work.  Therefore, if we accepted appellants\' theory that the national undercount level sets a limit on our ability to use census data to tell the difference between the populations of congressional districts, we might well be forced to set that level far above one percent when final analyses of the 1980 census are completed. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>As Dr. Trussell admits, <em>id.</em> at 103, the existence of a one percent undercount would be irrelevant to population deviations among districts if the undercount were distributed evenly among districts.  The undercount in the census affects the accuracy of the <em>deviations</em> between districts only to the extent that the undercount varies from district to district.  For a one percent undercount to explain a one percent deviation between the census populations of two districts, the undercount in the smaller district would have to be approximately three times as large as the undercount in the larger </p><p><a class="page-number" name="737">Page 462 U. S. 737</a></p><p> district. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It is highly unlikely, of course, that this condition holds true, especially since appellants have utterly failed to introduce evidence showing that the districts were designed to compensate for the probable undercount.  Dr. Trussell\'s affidavit states that the rate of undercounting may vary from municipality to municipality, but it does not discuss by how much it may vary, or to what extent those variations would be reflected at the district level, with many municipalities combined.  Nor does the affidavit indicate that the factors associated with the rate of undercounting -- race, sex, age, etc. -- vary from district to district, or (more importantly) that the populations in the smaller districts reflect the relevant factors more than the populations in the larger districts. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  As Dr. Trussell admits, the distribution of the undercount in New Jersey is completely unknown.  Only by bizarre coincidence could the systematic undercount in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="738">Page 462 U. S. 738</a></p><p> census bear some statistical relationship to the districts drawn by the Feldman Plan.</p>\n<p>The census may systematically undercount population, and the rate of undercounting may vary from place to place.  Those facts, however, do not render meaningless the differences in population between congressional districts, as determined by uncorrected census counts.  To the contrary, the census data provide the only reliable -- albeit less than perfect -- indication of the districts"\'real" relative population levels.  Even if one cannot say with certainty that one district is larger than another merely because it has a higher census count, one <em>can</em> say with certainty that the district with a larger census count is more likely to be larger than the other district than it is to be smaller or the same size.  That certainty is sufficient for decisionmaking.  <em>Cf. City of Newark v. Blumenthal,</em> 457 F.Supp. 30, 34 (DC 1978).  Furthermore, because the census count represents the "best population data available," <em>see Kirkpatrick,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#528">394 U. S. 528</a></span>, it is the only basis for good faith attempts to achieve population equality.  Attempts to explain population deviations on the basis of flaws in census data must be supported with a precision not achieved here.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#535">394 U. S. 535</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Given that the census-based population deviations in the Feldman Plan reflect real differences among the districts, it is clear that they could have been avoided or significantly reduced with a good faith effort to achieve population equality.  For that reason alone, it would be inappropriate to accept the Feldman Plan as "functionally equivalent" to a plan with districts of equal population.</p>\n<p>The District Court found that several other plans introduced in the 200th Legislature had smaller maximum deviations than the Feldman Plan.  535 F.Supp. at 982.  <em>Cf. White v. Weiser,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html#790">412 U. S. 790</a></span>, and n. 9.  Appellants object that the alternative plans considered by the District Court were not comparable to the Feldman Plan, because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="739">Page 462 U. S. 739</a></p><p> their political characters differed profoundly.  <em>See, e.g.,</em>App. 93-96 (affidavit of S. H. Woodson, Jr.) (arguing that alternative plans failed to protect the interests of black voters in the Trenton and Camden areas).  We have never denied that apportionment is a political process, or that state legislatures could pursue legitimate secondary objectives as long as those objectives were consistent with a good faith effort to achieve population equality at the same time.  Nevertheless, the claim that political considerations require population differences among congressional districts belongs more properly to the second level of judicial inquiry in these cases, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#740">462 U. S. 740</a></span>-741, in which the State bears the burden of justifying the differences with particularity.</p>\n<p>In any event, it was unnecessary for the District Court to rest its finding on the existence of alternative plans with radically different political effects.  As in <em>Kirkpatrick,</em></p>\n<p>"resort to the simple device of transferring entire political subdivisions of known population between contiguous districts would have produced districts much closer to numerical equality."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#532">394 U. S. 532</a></span>.  Starting with the Feldman Plan itself and the census data available to the legislature at the time it was enacted, <em>see</em> App. 23-34, one can reduce the maximum population deviation of the plan merely by shifting a handful of municipalities from one district to another. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="740">Page 462 U. S. 740</a></p><p> See also <em>Swann v.

Rather, appellees\' success in proving that the Feldman Plan was not the product of a good faith effort to achieve population equality means only that the burden shifted to the State to prove that the population deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve some legitimate state objective.  <em>White v. Weiser</em> demonstrates that we are willing to defer to state legislative policies, so long as they are consistent with constitutional norms, even if they require small differences in the population of congressional districts.  <em>See</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html#795">412 U. S. 795</a></span>-797; <em>cf. Upham v. Seamon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/37/case.html">456 U. S. 37</a></span> (1982); <em>Connor v.

S. 414</a></span>-415 (1977).  Any number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, making districts compact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.  As long as the criteria are nondiscriminatory, <em>see Gomillion v. Lightfoot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html">364 U. S. 339</a></span> (1960), these are all legitimate objectives that, on a proper showing, could justify minor population deviations.  <em>See, e.g., West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="741">Page 462 U. S. 741</a></p><p> <em>Rockefeller,</em> 336 F.Supp. 395, 398-400 (SD W.Va.1972) (approving plan with 0.78% maximum deviation as justified by compactness provision in State Constitution); <em>c\xc2\xa7f.

The State must, however, show with some specificity that a particular objective required the specific deviations in its plan, rather than simply relying on general assertions.  The showing required to justify population deviations is flexible, depending on the size of the deviations, the importance of the State\'s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alternatives that might substantially vindicate those interests yet approximate population equality more closely.  By necessity, whether deviations are justified requires case-by-case attention to these factors.</p>\n<p>The possibility that a State could justify small variations in the census-based population of its congressional districts on the basis of some legitimate, consistently applied policy was recognized in <em>Kirkpatrick</em> itself.  In that case, Missouri advanced the theory, echoed by JUSTICE WHITE in dissent, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#771">462 U. S. 771</a></span>-772, that district-to-district differences in the number of eligible voters, or projected population shifts, justified the population deviations in that case.  394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#534">394 U. S. 534</a></span>-535.  We rejected its arguments not because those factors were impermissible considerations in the apportionment process, but rather because of the size of the resulting deviations and because Missouri "[a]t best . . . made haphazard adjustments to a scheme based on total population," made "no attempt" to account for the same factors in all districts, and generally failed to document its findings thoroughly and apply them  "throughout the State in a systematic, not an <em>ad hoc,</em> manner." <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#535">394 U.

S. 742</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The District Court properly found that appellants did not Justify the population deviations in this case.  At argument before the District Court and on appeal in this Court, appellants emphasized only one justification for the Feldman Plan\'s population deviations -- preserving the voting strength of racial minority groups. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  They submitted affidavits from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="743">Page 462 U. S. 743</a></p><p> Mayors Kenneth Gibson of Newark and Thomas Cooke of East Orange, discussing the importance of having a large majority of black voters in Newark\'s Tenth District, App. 86-92, as well as an affidavit from S. Howard Woodson, Jr., a candidate for Mayor of Trenton, comparing the Feldman Plan\'s treatment of black voters in the Trenton and Camden areas with that of the Reock Plan, <em>id.</em> at 93-96.  <em>See also id.</em> at 82-83 (affidavit of A. Karcher).  The District Court found, however:</p>\n<p>"[Appellants] have not attempted to demonstrate, nor can they demonstrate, any causal relationship between the goal of preserving minority voting strength in the Tenth District and the population variances in the other districts. . . .  We find that the goal of preserving minority voting strength in the Tenth District is not related in any way to the population deviations in the Fourth and Sixth Districts."</p>\n<p>535 F.Supp. at 982.</p>\n<p>Under the Feldman Plan, the largest districts are the Fourth and Ninth Districts, and the smallest are the Third and Sixth.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#728">462 U. S. 728</a></span>.  None of these districts borders on the Tenth, and only one -- the Fourth -- is even mentioned in appellants\' discussions of preserving minority voting strength.  Nowhere do appellants suggest that the large population of the Fourth District was necessary to preserve minority voting strength; in fact, the deviation between the Fourth District and other districts has the effect of diluting the votes of all residents of that district, including members of racial minorities, as compared with other districts with fewer minority voters.  The record is completely silent on the relationship between preserving minority voting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="744">Page 462 U. S. 744</a></p><p> strength and the small populations of the Third and Sixth Districts.  Therefore, the District Court\'s findings easily pass the "clearly erroneous" test.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court properly applied the two-part test of <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preisler</em> to New Jersey\'s 1982 apportionment of districts for the United States House of Representatives.  It correctly held that the population deviations in the plan were not functionally equal as a matter of law, and it found that the plan was not a good faith effort to achieve population equality using the best available census data.  It also correctly rejected appellants\' attempt to justify the population deviations as not supported by the evidence.  The judgment of the District Court, therefore, is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Three sets of census data are relevant to this case.  In early 1981, the Bureau of the Census released preliminary figures showing that the total population of New Jersey was 7,364,158.  In October, 1981, it released corrected data, which increased the population of East Orange (and the State as a whole) by 665 people.  Brief for Appellants 3, n. 1.  All calculations in this opinion refer to the data available to the legislature -- that is, the October, 1981, figures.  After the proceedings below had concluded, the Bureau of the Census made an additional correction in the population of East Orange, adding another 188 people, and bringing the total population of the State to 7,365,011.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because this last correction was not available to the legislature at the time it enacted the plan at issue, we need not consider it.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>In relevant part:</p>\n<p>"The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"Representatives . . . shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>There is some evidence in the record from which one could infer that this is precisely what happened in New Jersey.  Alan Karcher, Speaker of the Assembly, testified that he had set one-percent maximum deviation as the upper limit for any plans to be considered seriously by the legislature, Record Doc. No. 41, pp. 56-58 (Karcher deposition), but there is no evidence of any serious attempt to seek improvements below the one-percent level.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Such problems certainly apply to JUSTICE WHITE\'s concededly arbitrary five-percent solution, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#782">462 U. S. 782</a></span>, apparently selected solely to avoid the embarrassment of discarding the actual result in <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> along with its reasoning.  No <em>de minimis</em> line tied to actual population in any way mitigates differences identified <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#771">462 U. S. 771</a></span>-772, between the number of adults or eligible, registered, or actual voters in any two districts.  As discussed below, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#736">462 U. S. 736</a></span>-738, unless some systematic effort is made to correct the distortions inherent in census counts of total population, deviations from the norm of population equality are far more likely to exacerbate the differences between districts.  If a State does attempt to use a measure other than total population or to "correct" the census figures, it may not do so in a haphazard, inconsistent, or conjectural manner.  <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> 394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#534">394 U.

But experience proves that cases in which a federal court is called upon to invalidate an existing apportionment, and sometimes to substitute a court-ordered plan in its stead, frequently arise not because a newly enacted apportionment plan fails to meet the test of <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> but because partisan politics frustrate the efforts of a state legislature to enact a new plan after a recent census has shown that the existing plan is grossly malapportioned.  <em>See, e.g., Carstens v. Lamm,</em> 543 F.Supp. 68 (Colo.1982); <em>Shayer v. Kirkpatrick,</em> 541 F.Supp. 922 (WD Mo.), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 456 U.S. 966 (1982); <em>O\'Sullivan v.

Robinson, Coverage of the National Population in the 1980 Census, by Age, Sex, and Race:  Preliminary Estimates by Demographic Analysis (Nov.1981) (Record Doc. No. 31) (hereinafter Passel).  Estimates for the national undercount in previous censuses range from 2.5% to 3.3%.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Panel on Decennial Census Plans, Counting the People in 1980:  An Appraisal of Census Plans 2 (Nat.Acad.Sciences 1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>As an example, assume that in a hypothetical State with two congressional districts District A has a population of 502,500, and District B has a population of 497,500.  The deviation between them is 5,000, or one percent of the mean.  If the statewide undercount is also one percent, and it is distributed evenly between the two districts, District A will have a "real" population of 507,525, and District B will have a "real" population of 502,475.  The deviation between them will remain one percent.  Only if three-fourths of the uncounted people in the State live in District B will the two districts have equal populations.  If three-fourths of the uncounted people happen to live in District A, the deviation between the two districts will increase to 1.98%.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>For instance, it is accepted that the rate of undercount in the census for black population on a nationwide basis is significantly higher than the rate of undercount for white population.  <em>See generally</em> Passel 9-20.  Yet the census population of the districts in the Feldman Plan is unrelated to the percentage of blacks in each district.  The Fourth District, for instance, is the largest district in terms of population, 0.268% above the mean; it has a 17.3% black population, App. 94.  The First District is 14.6% black, <em>id.</em> at 96, and it is almost exactly average in overall population.  The undercount in any particular district cannot be predicted only from the percentage of blacks in the district, but to the extent that blacks are not counted, the undercount would be more severe in the Fourth District than in the relatively less populous First District.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>According to the population figures used by Dr. Reock, the following adjustments to the Feldman Plan as enacted in Pub.L.1982, ch. 1, would reduce its maximum population variance to 0.449%, somewhat lower than the version of the Reock Plan introduced in the legislature:  to the Fifth District, add Oakland and Franklin Lakes (from the Eighth District), and Hillsdale, Woodcliff Lake, and Norwood (from the Ninth District).  To the Sixth District, add North Brunswick (from the Seventh District).  To the Seventh District, add Roosevelt (from the Fourth District), and South Plainfield and Helmetta (from the Sixth District).  To the Eighth District, add Montville and Boonton Town (from the Fifth District).  To the Ninth District, add River Edge and Oradell (from the Fifth District).</p>\n<p>Some of these changes are particularly obvious.  Shifting the small town of Roosevelt from the Fourth to the Seventh District brings both appreciably closer to the mean, and the town is already nearly surrounded by the Seventh District.  Similarly, River Edge, Oradell, Norwood, and Montville are barely contiguous with their present districts and almost completely surrounded by the new districts suggested above.  Further improvement could doubtless be accomplished with the aid of a computer and detailed census data.  <em>See also</em> <a href="#F5" name="T5">n</a> 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>We do not, of course, prejudge the validity of a plan incorporating these changes, nor do we indicate that a plan cannot represent a good faith effort whenever a court can conceive of minor improvements.  We point them out only to illustrate that further reductions could have been achieved within the basic framework of the Feldman Plan.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The very cases on which <em>Kirkpatrick</em> relied made clear that the principle of population equality did not entirely preclude small deviations caused by adherence to consistent state policies.  <em>See Swann v. Adams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/440/case.html">385 U. S. 440</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/440/case.html#444">385 U.

S. 579</span> (1964).  District Courts applying the <em>Kirkpatrick</em> standard have consistently recognized that small deviations could be justified.  <em>See, e.g., Doulin v. White,</em> 528 F.Supp. 1323, 1330 (ED Ark.1982) (rejecting projected population shifts as justification for plan with 1.87% maximum deviation because largest district also had largest projected growth); <em>West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller,</em> 336 F.Supp. 395, 398-400 (SD W.Va.1972).  Furthermore, courts using the <em>Kirkpatrick</em> standard to evaluate proposed remedies for unconstitutional apportionments have often, as in <em>White v. Weiser,</em> rejected the plan with the lowest population deviation in favor of plans with slightly higher deviations that reflected consistent state policies.  <em>See, e.g., David v. Cahill,</em> 342 F.Supp. 463 (NJ 1972); <em>Skolnick v. State Electoral Board of Illinois,</em> 336 F.Supp. at 842-846.  A number of District Courts applying the <em>Kirkpatrick</em> test to apportionments of state legislatures, before this Court disapproved the practice in <em>Mahan v. Howell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/315/case.html">410 U. S. 315</a></span> (1973), also understood that justification of small deviations was a very real possibility.  <em>E.g., Kelly v. Bumpers,</em> 340 F.Supp. 568, 571 (ED Ark.1972), <em>summarily aff\'d,</em> 413 U.S. 901 (1973); <em>Ferrell v. Oklahoma ex rel.

The court in <em>Graves v. Barnes,</em> 343 F.Supp. 704 (WD Tex.1972) later reversed by this Court for applying <em>Kirkpatrick</em> at all, <em>White v. Regester,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/case.html">412 U. S. 755</a></span> (1973) characterized the inquiry required by <em>Kirkpatrick</em> as follows:</p>\n<p>"The critical issue remains the same:  has the State justified any and all variances, however small, on the basis of a consistent, rational State policy."</p>\n<p>343 F.Supp. at 713; <em>see id.</em> at 713-716.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>At oral argument in this Court, appellants stated that the drafters of the Feldman Plan were concerned with a number of other objectives as well, namely "to preserve the cores of existing districts" and "to preserve municipal boundaries."  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 14.  <em>See also</em> Answer and Counterclaim on Behalf of Alan J. Karcher \xef\xbf\xbd 10 (Record Doc. No. 17).  Similarly, Speaker Karcher\'s affidavit suggests that the legislature was concerned that the Ninth District should lie entirely within Bergen County.  App. 84.  None of these justifications was presented to the District Court or this Court in any but the most general way, however, and the relevant question presented by appellants to this Court excludes them:</p>\n<p>"Whether the legislative policy of preserving minority voting strength justifies small deviations from census population equality in a congressional reapportionment plan."</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellants i.  Furthermore, several plans before the legislature with significantly lower population deviations kept municipalities intact and had an all-Bergen County Ninth District.  <em>See</em> App. 66-14.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>As an alternative ground for affirmance, the appellees contended at oral argument that the bizarre configuration of New Jersey\'s congressional districts is sufficient to demonstrate that the plan was not adopted in "good faith."  This argument, as I understand it, is a claim that the district boundaries are unconstitutional because they are the product of political gerrymandering.  Since my vote is decisive in this case, it seems appropriate to explain how this argument influences my analysis of the question that divides the Court.  As I have previously pointed out, political gerrymandering is one species of "vote dilution" that is proscribed by the Equal Protection Clause. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Because an adequate judicial analysis of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="745">Page 462 U. S. 745</a></p><p> a gerrymandering claim raises special problems, I shall comment at some length on the legal basis for a gerrymandering claim, the standards for judging such a claim, and their relevance to the present case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Relying on Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, of the Constitution, as interpreted in <em>Wesberry v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/case.html">376 U. S. 1</a></span> (1964), and subsequent cases, appellees successfully challenged the congressional districting plan adopted by the New Jersey Legislature.  For the reasons stated in JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s opinion for the Court, which I join, the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> requires that result.  It can be demonstrated, however, that the holding in <em>Wesberry,</em> as well as our holding today, has firmer roots in the Constitution than those provided by Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2.</p>\n<p>The constitutional mandate contained in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, concerns the number of Representatives that shall be "apportioned <em>among</em> the several States." [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The section says nothing about the composition of congressional districts <em>within</em> a State. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Indeed, the text of that section places no restriction whatsoever on the power of any State to define the group of persons within the State who may vote for particular candidates.  If a State should divide its registered voters into separate classes defined by the alphabetical order of their initials, by their age, by their period of residence in the State, or even by their political affiliation, such a classification would not be barred by the text of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, even if the classes contained widely different numbers of voters. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="746">Page 462 U. S. 746</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As Justice Harlan pointed out in his dissenting opinion in <em>Wesberry,</em> prior to the Civil War, the principle of numerical equality of representation was actually contradicted by the text of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, which provided that the "whole Number of free Persons" should be counted, that certain Indians should be excluded, and that only "three-fifths of all other Persons" should be added to the total. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  In analyzing the Constitution, we cannot ignore the regrettable fact that, as originally framed, it expressly tolerated the institution of slavery.  On the other hand, neither can we ignore the basic changes caused by the Civil War Amendments.  They planted the roots that firmly support today\'s holding.</p>\n<p>The abolition of slavery and the guarantees of citizenship and voting rights contained in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments effectively repealed Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2\'s requirement that some votes be given greater weight than others.  It remains true, however, that Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, does not itself contain any guarantee of equality of representation.  The source of that guarantee must be found elsewhere.  But as Justice Clark perceptively noted in his partial concurrence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="747">Page 462 U. S. 747</a></p><p> in <em>Wesberry</em> -- and as Justice Black had written earlier in his dissent in <em>Colegrove v. Green,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/549/case.html">328 U. S. 549</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/549/case.html#569">328 U. S. 569</a></span> (1946) -- that guarantee is firmly grounded in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Even Justice Harlan\'s powerful dissent in <em>Wesberry</em> could find no flaw in that analysis.</p>\n<p>In its review of state laws redefining congressional districts subsequent to <em>Wesberry v. Sanders,</em> the Court has not found it necessary to rely on the Equal Protection Clause.  That Clause has, however, provided the basis for applying the "one person, one vote" standard to other electoral districts.  <em>See, e.g., Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span> (1962); <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span> (1964); <em>Avery v. Midland County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/474/case.html">390 U. S. 474</a></span> (1968).  Even if Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, were wholly disregarded, the "one person, one vote" rule would unquestionably apply to action by state officials defining congressional districts just as it does to state action defining state legislative districts. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="748">Page 462 U. S. 748</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Equal Protection Clause requires every State to govern impartially.  When a State adopts rules governing its election machinery or defining electoral boundaries, those rules must serve the interests of the entire community.  <em>See Reynolds v. Sims, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 565</span>-566.  If they serve no purpose other than to favor one segment -- whether racial, ethnic, religious, economic, or political -- that may occupy a position of strength at a particular point in time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment of the community, they violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html">364 U. S. 339</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html#340">364 U. S. 340</a></span> (1960), the Court invalidated a change in the city boundaries of Tuskegee, Alabama, "from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure" excluding virtually all of the city\'s black voters.  The Court\'s opinion identified the right that had been violated as a group right:</p>\n<p>"When a legislature thus singles out a readily isolated segment of a racial minority for special discriminatory treatment, it violates the Fifteenth Amendment.  In no case involving unequal weight in voting distribution that has come before the Court did the decision sanction a differentiation on racial lines whereby approval was given to unequivocal withdrawal of the vote solely from colored citizens."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html#346">364 U. S. 346</a></span>.  Although the Court explicitly rested its decision on the Fifteenth Amendment, the analysis in Justice Whittaker\'s concurring opinion -- like Justice Clark\'s in <em>Wesberry</em> -- is equally coherent, <em>see</em> 364 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/case.html#349">364 U. S. 349</a></span>.  Moreover, the Court has subsequently treated <em>Gomillion</em> as though it had been decided on equal protection grounds.  <em>See Whitcomb v. Chavis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/124/case.html">403 U.

In his dissenting opinion today, JUSTICE WHITE seems to agree that New Jersey\'s plan would violate the Equal Protection Clause if it "invidiously discriminated against a racial or political group."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#783">462 U. S. 783</a></span>.</p>\n<p>There is only one Equal Protection Clause.  Since the Clause does not make some groups of citizens more equal than others, <em>see Zobel v. Williams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/55/case.html">457 U. S. 55</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/457/55/case.html#71">457 U.

As long as it proscribes gerrymandering against such groups, its proscription must provide comparable protection for other cognizable groups of voters as well.  As I have previously written:</p>\n<p>"In the line-drawing process, racial, religious, ethnic, and economic gerrymanders are all species of political gerrymanders."</p>\n<p>"From the standpoint of the groups of voters that are affected by the line-drawing process, it is also important </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 462 U.

The mere fact that a number of citizens share a common ethnic, racial, or religious background does not create the need for protection against gerrymandering.  It is only when their common interests are strong enough to be manifested in political action that the need arises.  For the political strength of a group is not a function of its ethnic, racial, or religious composition; rather, it is a function of numbers -- specifically the number of persons who will vote in the same way."</p>\n<p><em>Mobile v.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Like JUSTICE WHITE, I am convinced that judicial preoccupation with the goal of perfect population equality is an inadequate method of judging the constitutionality of an apportionment plan.  I would not hold that an obvious gerrymander is wholly immune from attack simply because it comes closer to perfect population equality than every competing plan.  On the other hand, I do not find any virtue in the proposal to relax the standard set forth in <em>Wesberry</em> and subsequent cases, and to ignore population disparities after some arbitrarily defined threshold has been crossed. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  As one commentator </p><p><a class="page-number" name="751">Page 462 U. S. 751</a></p><p> has written:</p>\n<p>"Logic, as well as experience, tells us. . . that there can be no total sanctuaries in the political thicket, else unfairness will simply shift from one form to another. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]"</p>\n<p>Rather, we should supplement the population equality standard with additional criteria that are no less "judicially manageable."  In evaluating equal protection challenges to districting plans, just as in resolving such attacks on other forms of discriminatory action, I would consider whether the plan has a significant adverse impact on an identifiable political group, whether the plan has objective indicia of irregularity, and then, whether the State is able to produce convincing evidence that the plan nevertheless serves neutral, legitimate interests of the community as a whole.</p>\n<p>Until two decades ago, constrained by its fear of entering a standardless political thicket, the Court simply abstained from any attempt to judge the constitutionality of legislative apportionment plans, even when the districts varied in population from 914,053 to 112,116.  <em>See Colegrove v. Green,</em> 328 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/549/case.html#557">328 U. S. 557</a></span>.  In <em>Baker v. Carr,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/186/case.html">369 U. S. 186</a></span> (1962), and <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span> (1964), the Court abandoned that extreme form of judicial restraint and enunciated the "one person, one vote" principle.  That standard is "judicially manageable" because census data are concrete and reasonably reliable and because judges can multiply and divide.</p>\n<p>Even as a basis for protecting voters in their individual capacity, the "one person, one vote" approach has its shortcomings.  Although population disparities are easily quantified, the standard provides no measure of the significance of any numerical difference.  It is easy to recognize the element of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="752">Page 462 U. S. 752</a></p><p> unfairness in allowing 112,116 voters to elect one Congressman while another is elected by 914,053.  But how significant is the difference between census counts of 527,472 and 523,798?  Given the birth rate, the mortality rate, the transient character of modern society, and the acknowledged errors in the census, we all know that such differences may vanish between the date of the census and the date of the next election.  Absolute population equality is impossible to achieve.</p>\n<p>More important, mere numerical equality is not a sufficient guarantee of equal representation.  Although it directly protects individuals, it protects groups only indirectly, at best.  <em>See Reynolds v. Sims, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html#561">377 U. S. 561</a></span>.  A voter may challenge an apportionment scheme on the ground that it gives his vote less weight than that of other voters; for that purpose, it does not matter whether the plaintiff is combined with or separated from others who might share his group affiliation.  It is plainly unrealistic to assume that a smaller numerical disparity will always produce a fairer districting plan.  Indeed, as Justice Harlan correctly observed in <em>Wells v. Rockefeller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/542/case.html">394 U. S. 542</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/542/case.html#551">394 U. S. 551</a></span> (1969), a standard</p>\n<p>"of absolute equality is perfectly compatible with \'gerrymandering\' of the worst sort.  A computer may grind out district lines which can totally frustrate the popular will on an overwhelming number of critical issues."</p>\n<p>Since Justice Harlan wrote, developments in computer technology have made the task of the gerrymanderer even easier.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#776">462 U.

S. 753</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The imperfections in the numerical standard do not, of course, render it useless.  It provides one neutral criterion for evaluating a districting plan.  Numerical disparities may provide sufficient basis for shifting the burden of justification to the State.  Moreover, if all other factors were in equipoise, it would be proper to conclude that the plan that most nearly attains the goal of complete equality would be the fairest plan.  The major shortcoming of the numerical standard is its failure to take account of other relevant -- indeed, more important -- criteria relating to the fairness of group participation in the political process.  To that extent, it may indeed be counterproductive.  <em>See Gaffney v. Cummings,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html#748">412 U. S. 748</a></span>-749. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>To a limited extent, the Court has taken cognizance of discriminatory treatment of groups of voters.  The path the Court has sometimes used to enter this political thicket is marked by the label "intent."  A finding that the majority deliberately sought to make it difficult for a minority group to elect representatives may provide a sufficient basis for holding that an objectively neutral electoral plan is unconstitutional.  <em>See Rogers v. Lodge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html">458 U. S. 613</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html#616">458 U. S. 616</a></span>-617 (1982).  For reasons that I have already set forth at length, this standard is inadequate.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html#642">458 U. S. 642</a></span>-650 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <em>Mobile v. Bolden,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/55/case.html#83">446 U. S. 83</a></span> (STEVENS,J., concurring in judgment).  I would not condemn a legislature\'s districting plan in the absence of discriminatory impact simply because its proponents were motivated, in part, by partisanship or group animus.  Legislators are, after all, politicians; it is unrealistic to attempt to proscribe all political considerations in the essentially political process of redistricting.  In the long run, constitutional adjudication that is premised on a case-by-case appraisal of the subjective intent of local decisionmakers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="754">Page 462 U. S. 754</a></p><p> cannot possibly satisfy the requirement of impartial administration of the law that is embodied in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  On the other hand, if a plan has a significant adverse impact upon a defined political group, an additional showing that it departs dramatically from neutral criteria should suffice to shift the task of justification to the state defendants.</p>\n<p>For a number of reasons, this is a burden that plaintiffs can meet in relatively few cases.  As a threshold matter, plaintiffs must show that they are members of an identifiable political group whose voting strength has been diluted.  They must first prove that they belong to a politically salient class, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#749">462 U. S. 749</a></span>-750, one whose geographical distribution is sufficiently ascertainable that it could have been taken into account in drawing district boundaries. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  Second, they must prove that in the relevant district or districts or in the State as a whole, their proportionate voting influence has been adversely affected by the challenged scheme. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  Third, plaintiffs </p><p><a class="page-number" name="755">Page 462 U. S. 755</a></p><p> must make a <em>prima facie</em> showing that raises a rebuttable presumption of discrimination.</p>\n<p>One standard method by which members of a disadvantaged political group may establish a dilution of their voting rights is by reliance on the "one person, one vote" principle, which depends on a state-wide statistical analysis.  But <em>prima facie</em> evidence of gerrymandering can surely be presented in other ways.  One obvious type of evidence is the shape of the district configurations themselves.  One need not use Justice Stewart\'s classic definition of obscenity -- "I know it when I see it" [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] -- as an ultimate standard for judging the constitutionality of a gerrymander to recognize that dramatically irregular shapes may have sufficient probative force to call for an explanation. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]</p>\n<p>Substantial divergences from a mathematical standard of compactness may be symptoms of illegitimate gerrymandering.  As Dr. Ernest Reock, Jr., of Rutgers University has written:</p>\n<p>"Without some requirement of compactness, the boundaries of a district may twist and wind their way across the map in fantastic fashion in order to absorb scattered </p><p><a class="page-number" name="756">Page 462 U. S. 756</a></p><p> pockets of partisan support. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]"</p>\n<p>To some extent, geographical compactness serves independent values; it facilitates political organization, electoral campaigning, and constituent representation. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  A number of state statutes and Constitutions require districts to be compact and contiguous.  These standards have been of limited utility, because they have not been defined and applied with rigor and precision. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Yet Professor Reock and other scholars have set forth a number of methods of measuring compactness that can be computed with virtually the same degree of precision as a population count. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  It is true, of course, that the significance of a particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="757">Page 462 U. S. 757</a></p><p> compactness measure may be difficult to evaluate, but as the figures in this case demonstrate, the same may be said of population disparities.  In addition, although some deviations from compactness may be inescapable because of the geographical configuration or uneven population density of a particular State, [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] the relative degrees of compactness of different </p><p><a class="page-number" name="758">Page 462 U. S. 758</a></p><p> district maps can always be compared.  As with the numerical standard, it seems fair to conclude that drastic departures from compactness are a signal that something may be amiss.</p>\n<p>Extensive deviation from established political boundaries is another possible basis for a <em>prima facie</em> showing of gerrymandering.  As we wrote in <em>Reynolds v. Sims:</em></p>\n<p>"Indiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering."</p>\n<p>377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 578</span>-579. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Subdivision boundaries tend to remain stable over time.  Residents of political units such as townships, cities, and counties often develop a community of interest, particularly when the subdivision plays an important role in the provision of governmental services.  In addition, legislative districts that do not cross subdivision boundaries are administratively convenient and less likely to confuse the voters. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Although the significance of deviations from subdivision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="759">Page 462 U. S. 759</a></p><p> boundaries will vary with the number of legislative seats and the number, size, and shape of the State\'s subdivisions, the number can be counted [<a href="#F2/23" name="T2/23">Footnote 2/23</a>] and alternative plans can be compared.</p>\n<p>A procedural standard, although obviously less precise, may also be enlightening.  If the process for formulating and adopting a plan excluded divergent viewpoints, openly reflected the use of partisan criteria, and provided no explanation of the reasons for selecting one plan over another, it would seem appropriate to conclude that an adversely affected plaintiff group is entitled to have the majority explain its action. [<a href="#F2/24" name="T2/24">Footnote 2/24</a>]  On the other hand, if neutral decisionmakers developed the plan on the basis of neutral criteria, if there was an adequate opportunity for the presentation and consideration of differing points of view, and if the guidelines used in selecting a plan were explained, a strong presumption of validity should attach to whatever plan such a process produced.</p>\n<p>Although a scheme in fact worsens the voting position of a particular group, [<a href="#F2/25" name="T2/25">Footnote 2/25</a>] and though its geographic configuration or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="760">Page 462 U. S. 760</a></p><p> genesis is sufficiently irregular to violate one or more of the criteria just discussed, it will nevertheless be constitutionally valid if the State can demonstrate that the plan as a whole embodies acceptable, neutral objectives.  The same kinds of justification that the Court accepts as legitimate in the context of population disparities would also be available whenever the criteria of shape, compactness, political boundaries, or decisionmaking procedures have sent up warning flags.  In order to overcome a <em>prima facie</em> case of invalidity, the State may adduce "legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy," <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> 377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 579</span>, and may also</p>\n<p>"show with some specificity that a particular objective requires the specific deviations in its plan, rather than simply relying on general assertions.  The showing . . . is flexible, depending on the size of the deviations, the importance of the State\'s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole reflects those interests, and the availability of alternatives that might substantially vindicate those interests yet approximate population equality more closely."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#741">462 U.

[<a href="#F2/26" name="T2/26">Footnote 2/26</a>]</p>\n<p>If a State is unable to respond to a plaintiff\'s <em>prima facie</em> case by showing that its plan is supported by adequate neutral criteria, I believe a court could properly conclude that the challenged scheme is either totally irrational or entirely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="761">Page 462 U. S. 761</a></p><p> motivated by a desire to curtail the political strength of the affected political group.  This does not mean that federal courts should invalidate or even review every apportionment plan that may have been affected to some extent by partisan legislative maneuvering. [<a href="#F2/27" name="T2/27">Footnote 2/27</a>]  But I am convinced that the Judiciary is not powerless to provide a constitutional remedy in egregious cases. [<a href="#F2/28" name="T2/28">Footnote 2/28</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In this case, it is not necessary to go beyond the reasoning in the Court\'s opinions in <em>Wesberry v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/case.html">376 U. S. 1</a></span> (1964), <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preisler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html">394 U. S. 526</a></span> (1969), and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="762">Page 462 U.

None of the additional criteria that I have mentioned would cast any doubt on the propriety of the Court\'s holding in this case.  Although I need not decide whether the plan\'s shortcomings regarding shape and compactness, subdivision boundaries, and neutral decisionmaking would establish a <em>prima facie</em> case, these factors certainly strengthen my conclusion that the New Jersey plan violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>A glance at the map shows district configurations well deserving the kind of descriptive adjectives -- "uncouth" [<a href="#F2/29" name="T2/29">Footnote 2/29</a>] and "bizarre" [<a href="#F2/30" name="T2/30">Footnote 2/30</a>] -- that have traditionally been used to describe acknowledged gerrymanders.  I have not applied the mathematical measures of compactness to the New Jersey map, but I think it likely that the plan would not fare well.  In addition, while disregarding geographical compactness, the redistricting scheme wantonly disregards county boundaries.  For example, in the words of a commentator:</p>\n<p>"In a flight of cartographic fancy, the Legislature packed North Jersey Republicans into a new district many call \'the Swan.\'  Its long neck and twisted body stretch from the New York suburbs to the rural upper reaches of the Delaware River."</p>\n<p>That district, the Fifth, contains segments of at least seven counties. The same commentator described the Seventh District, comprised of parts of five counties, as tracing "a curving partisan path through industrial Elizabeth, liberal, academic Princeton and largely Jewish Marlboro </p><p><a class="page-number" name="763">Page 462 U. S. 763</a></p><p> in Monmouth County."  The resulting monstrosity was called "the Fishhook" by detractors.</p>\n<p>40 Congressional Quarterly 1193-1195 (1982). [<a href="#F2/31" name="T2/31">Footnote 2/31</a>]</p>\n<p>Such a map prompts an inquiry into the process that led to its adoption.  The plan was sponsored by the leadership in the Democratic Party, which controlled both houses of the state legislature as well as the Governor\'s office, and was signed into law the day before the inauguration of a Republican Governor.  The legislators never formally explained the guidelines used in formulating their plan or in selecting it over other available plans.  Several of the rejected plans contained districts that were more nearly equal in population, more compact, and more consistent with subdivision boundaries, including one submitted by a recognized expert, Dr. Ernest Reock, Jr., whose impartiality and academic credentials were not challenged.  The District Court found that the Reock Plan "was rejected because it did not reflect the leadership\'s partisan concerns."  <em>Daggett v. Kimmelman,</em> 535 F.Supp. 978, 982 (NJ 1982).  This conclusion, which arises naturally from the absence of persuasive justifications for the rejection of the Reock Plan, is buttressed by a letter written to Dr. Reock by the Democratic Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly.  This letter frankly explained the importance to the Democrats of taking advantage of their opportunity to control redistricting after the 1980 census.  The Speaker justified his own overt partisanship by describing the political considerations that had motivated the Republican majority in the adoption of district plans in New </p><p><a class="page-number" name="764">Page 462 U. S. 764</a></p><p> Jersey in the past -- and in other States at the present. [<a href="#F2/32" name="T2/32">Footnote 2/32</a>]  In sum, the record indicates that the decisionmaking process leading to adoption of the challenged plan was far from neutral.  It was designed to increase the number of Democrats, and to decrease the number of Republicans, that New Jersey\'s voters would send to Congress in future years. [<a href="#F2/33" name="T2/33">Footnote 2/33</a>]  Finally, the record does not show any legitimate justifications for the irregularities in the New Jersey plan, although concededly the case was tried on a different theory in the District Court.</p>\n<p>Because I have not made a comparative study of other districting plans, and because the State has not had the opportunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="765">Page 462 U. S. 765</a></p><p> to offer justifications specifically directed toward the additional concerns I have discussed, I cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the New Jersey plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  But I am in full agreement with the Court\'s holding that, because the plan embodies deviations from population equality that have not been justified by any neutral state objective, it cannot stand.  Further, if population equality provides the only check on political gerrymandering, it would be virtually impossible to fashion a fair and effective remedy in a case like this.  For if the shape of legislative districts is entirely unconstrained, the dominant majority could no doubt respond to an unfavorable judgment by providing an even more grotesque-appearing map that reflects acceptable numerical equality with even greater political inequality.  If federal judges can prevent that consequence by taking a hard look at the shape of things to come in the remedy hearing, I believe they can also scrutinize the original map with sufficient care to determine whether distortions have any rational basis in neutral criteria.  Otherwise, the promise of <em>Baker v. Carr</em> and <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em> -- that judicially manageable standards can assure "[f]ull and effective participation by all citizens," 377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/46/case.html#56">377 U.

In the cases in which the rule was first developed, district boundaries accorded significantly less weight to individual votes in the most populous districts.  But it was also clear that those boundaries maximized the political strength of rural voters and diluted the political power of urban voters.  <em>See</em> A.

Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement."</p>\n<p>The States responded to <em>Wesberry</em> by eliminating gross disparities between congressional districts.  Nevertheless, redistricting plans with far smaller variations were struck by the Court five years later in <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra,</em> and its companion, <em>Wells v.

Although the Court stated that it could see "no nonarbitrary way" to pick a <em>de minimis</em> point, the maximum deviation in <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> while small, was more than eight times as large as that posed here.  Moreover, the deviation in <em>Kirkpatrick</em> was not argued to fall within the officially accepted range of statistical imprecision of the census.  Interestingly enough, the Missouri redistricting plan approved after <em>Kirkpatrick</em> contained a deviation of 0.629% -- virtually the same deviation declared unconstitutional in this case.  <em>Preisler v. Secretary of State of Missouri,</em> 341 F.Supp. 1158, 1162 (WD Mo.), <em>summarily aff\'d sub nom. Danforth v. Preisler,</em> 407 U.S. 901 (1972). [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Accordingly, I do not view the Court\'s decision today as foreordained by <em>Kirkpatrick</em> and <em>Weiser.</em>  Apparently neither did JUSTICE BRENNAN who, in staying the District Court\'s order, wrote:</p>\n<p>"The appeal would thus appear to present the important question whether <em>Kirkpatrick v. Preisler</em> requires adoption of the plan that achieves the most precise mathematical </p><p><a class="page-number" name="769">Page 462 U. S. 769</a></p><p> exactitude, or whether <em>Kirkpatrick</em> left some latitude for the New Jersey Legislature to recognize the considerations taken into account by it as a basis for choosing among several plans, each with arguably \'statistically insignificant\' variances from the constitutional ideal of absolute precision."</p>\n<p>455 U.S. 1303,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/455/1303/case.html#1305">455 U. S. 1305</a></span> (1982).</p>\n<p>There can be little question but that the variances in the New Jersey plan are "statistically insignificant."  Although the Government strives to make the decennial census as accurate as humanly possible, the Census Bureau has never intimated that the results are a perfect count of the American population.  The Bureau itself estimates the inexactitude in the taking of the 1970 census at 2.3%, [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] a figure which is considerably larger than the 0.6984% maximum variance in the New Jersey plan, and which dwarfs the 0.2470% difference between the maximum deviations of the selected plan and the leading alternative plan, that suggested by Professor Reock.  Because the amount of undercounting differs from district to district, there is no point for a court of law to act under an unproved assumption that such tiny differences between redistricting plans reflect actual differences in population.  As Dr. James Trussel, an expert in these matters, and whose testimony the Court purports to accept, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#735">462 U.

S. 770</a></p><p> it would be uniformly spread over all municipalities.  For these reasons, one cannot make congressional districts of truly equal size if one relies on census counts.  Nor is it meaningful to rank one redistricting plan as superior to another when differences in district size are small.  In my professional opinion, districts whose enumerated populations differ one from another by less than one percent should be considered to be equal in size.  To push for numerical equality beyond this point is an exercise in illusion."</p>\n<p>App. 103-104.4 [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="771">Page 462 U.

First, the census "is more of an event than a process."  <em>Gaffney v. Cummings,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html">412 U.

[<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Second, far larger differences among districts are introduced because a substantial percentage of the total population is too </p><p><a class="page-number" name="772">Page 462 U.

[<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  Third, census figures cannot account for the proportion of all those otherwise eligible individuals who fail to register. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  The differences in the number of eligible voters per district for these reasons overwhelm the minimal variations attributable to the districting plan itself. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Accepting that the census, and the districting plans which are based upon it, cannot be perfect represents no backsliding in our commitment to assuring fair and equal representation in the election of Congress.  I agree with the views of Judge Gibbons, who dissented in the District Court, that <em>Kirkpatrick</em> should not be read as a</p>\n<p>"prohibition against toleration of <em>de minimis</em> population variances which have no statistically relevant effect on relative representation."</p>\n<p><em>Daggett v. Kimmelman,</em> 535 F.Supp. at 984.  A plus-minus deviation of 0.6984% surely falls within this category.</p>\n<p>If today\'s decision simply produced an unjustified standard with little practical import, it would be bad enough.  Unfortunately, I fear that the Court\'s insistence that</p>\n<p>"there are no <em>de minimis</em> population variations which could practicably be avoided but which nonetheless meet the standard of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2, without justification,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#734">462 U.

At least 12 States which have completed redistricting on the basis of the 1980 census have adopted plans with a higher deviation than that presented here, and 4 others have deviations quite similar to New Jersey\'s. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  Of course, under the Court\'s rationale, even Rhode Island\'s plan -- whose two districts have a deviation of 0.02% or about 95 people would be subject to constitutional attack.</p>\n<p>In all such cases, state legislatures will be hard pressed to justify their preference for the selected plan.  A good faith effort to achieve population equality is not enough if the population variances are not "unavoidable."  The court must consider whether the population differences could have been further "reduced or eliminated altogether."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#730">462 U.

Then, "the State must bear the burden of proving that each significant variance between districts was necessary to achieve some legitimate goal."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#731">462 U.

[<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>]  The State\'s burden will not be easily met:  "the State bears the burden of justifying </p><p><a class="page-number" name="774">Page 462 U.

When the State fails to sustain its burden, the result will generally be that a court must select an alternative plan.  The choice will often be disputed until the very eve of an election, <em>see, e.g., Upham v. Seamon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/37/case.html">456 U.

[<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>]  Yet no one can seriously contend that such an inflexible insistence upon mathematical exactness will serve to promote "fair and effective representation."  The more likely result of today\'s extension of <em>Kirkpatrick</em> is to move closer to fulfilling Justice Fortas\' prophecy that</p>\n<p>"a legislature might have to ignore the boundaries of common sense, running the congressional district line down the middle of the corridor of an apartment house or even dividing the residents of a single-family house between two districts."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#538">394 U.

Such sterile and mechanistic application only brings the principle of "one man, one vote" into disrepute.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>One might expect the Court had strong reasons to force this Sisyphean task upon the States.  Yet the Court offers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 462 U. S. 775</a></p><p> no positive virtues that will follow from its decision.  No pretense is made that this case follows in the path of <em>Reynolds</em> and <em>Wesberry</em> in insuring the "fair and effective representation" of citizens.  No effort is expended to show that Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2\'s requirement that Congressmen be elected "by the people," <em>Wesberry v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/case.html">376 U. S. 1</a></span> (1964), demands the invalidation of population deviations at this level.  Any such absolute requirement, if it did exist, would be irreconcilable with the Court\'s recognition of certain justifications for population variances.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#740">462 U. S. 740</a></span>.  Given no express constitutional basis for the Court\'s holding, and no showing that the objectives of fair representation are compromised by these minimal disparities, the normal course would be to uphold the actions of the legislature in fulfilling its constitutionally delegated responsibility to prescribe the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.

The Court refuses to adopt any fixed numerical standard below which the federal courts would not intervene, asserting that "[t]he principle of population equality for congressional districts has not proved unjust or socially or economically harmful in experience."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#733">462 U.

Leaving aside that the principle has never been applied with the vengeance witnessed today, there are many, including myself, who take issue with the Court\'s self-congratulatory assumption that <em>Kirkpatrick</em> has been a success.  First, a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 462 U. S. 776</a></p><p> decade of experience with <em>Kirkpatrick</em> has shown that "the rule of absolute equality is perfectly compatible with <em>gerrymandering\' of the worst sort."  <em>Wells v.

With ever more sophisticated computers, legislators can draw countless plans for absolute population equality, but each having its own political ramifications.  Although neither a rule of absolute equality nor one of substantial equality can, alone, prevent deliberate partisan gerrymandering, the former offers legislators a ready justification for disregarding geographical and political boundaries.  I remain convinced of what I said in dissent in <em>Kirkpatrick</em> and <em>Wells:</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>"[Those] decisions . . . downgrade a restraint on a far greater potential threat to equality of representation, the gerrymander.  Legislatures intent on minimizing the representation of selected political or racial groups are invited to ignore political boundaries and compact districts so long as they adhere to population equality among districts using standards which we know and they know are sometimes quite incorrect."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/542/case.html#555">394 U.

What we said in <em>Gaffney</em> with respect to legislative reapportionment is apropos here:</p>\n<p>"[T]he goal of fair and effective representation [is not] furthered by making the standards of reapportionment so difficult to satisfy that the reapportionment task is recurringly removed from legislative hands and performed by federal courts which themselves must make the political decisions necessary to formulate a plan or accept those made by reapportionment plaintiffs who may have wholly different goals from those embodied in the official plan."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  More than a decade\'s experience with <em>Kirkpatrick</em> demonstrates that insistence on precise numerical equality only invites those who lost in the political arena to refight their battles in federal court.  Consequently, "[m]ost estimates are that between 25 percent and 35 percent of current house district lines were drawn by the Courts."  American Bar Association, Congressional Redistricting 20 (1981).  As I have already noted, by extending <em>Kirkpatrick</em> to deviations below even the 1% level, the redistricting plan in every State with more than a single Representative is rendered vulnerable to after-the-fact attack by anyone with a complaint and a calculator.</p>\n<p>The Court ultimately seeks refuge in <em>stare decisis.</em>  I do not slight the respect that doctrine is due, <em>see, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html">412 U.

In <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> the Court squarely rejected the argument that slight variances in district size were proper in order to avoid fragmenting political subdivisions:</p>\n<p>"[W]e do not find legally acceptable the argument that variances are justified if they necessarily result from a State\'s attempt to avoid fragmenting political subdivisions by drawing congressional district lines along existing county, municipal, or other political subdivision boundaries."</p>\n<p>394 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#533">394 U. S. 533</a></span>-534. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  Several pages later, the Court rejected in equally uncategorical terms the idea that variances may be justified in order to make districts more compact.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/case.html#535">394 U.

I, of course, welcome the Court\'s overruling of these ill-considered holdings of <em>Kirkpatrick.</em>  There should be no question but that state legislatures may account for political and geographic boundaries in order to preserve traditional subdivisions and achieve compact and contiguous districts.  JUSTICE STEVENS recognizes that courts should"</p>\n<p>"give greater weight to the importance of the State\'s interests and the consistency with which those interests are served than to the size of the deviations."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#760">462 U.

S. 785</span>, n. 1 (POWELL, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>In order that legislatures have room to accommodate these legitimate noncensus factors, a range of <em>de minimis</em> population deviation, like that permitted in the legislative reapportionment cases, is required.  The Court\'s insistence that every deviation, no matter how small, be justified with specificity discourages legislatures from considering these "legitimate" factors in making their plans, lest the justification be found wanting, the plan invalidated, and a judicially drawn substitute put in its place.  Moreover, the requirement of precise mathematical equality continues to invite those who would bury their political opposition to employ equipopulous gerrymanders.  A <em>de minimis</em> range would not preclude such gerrymanders, but would at least force the political cartographer to justify his work on its own terms.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our cases dealing with state legislative apportionment have taken a more sensible approach.  We have recognized that certain small deviations do not, in themselves, ordinarily constitute a <em>prima facie</em> constitutional violation.  <em>Gaffney v. Cummings,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html">412 U. S. 735</a></span> (1973); <em>White v.

Moreover, we have upheld plans with reasonable variances that were necessary to account for political </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 462 U. S. 781</a></p><p> subdivisions, <em>Mahan v. Howell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/315/case.html">410 U. S. 315</a></span> (1973), to preserve the voting strength of minority groups, and to insure political fairness, <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, supra.</em>  What we held in <em>Gaffney v. Cummings</em> for legislative apportionment is fully applicable to congressional redistricting:</p>\n<p>"\'[T]he achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is\' . . . a vital and worthy goal, but surely its attainment does not, in any common sense way, depend upon eliminating the insignificant population variations involved in this case.  Fair and effective representation may be destroyed by gross population variations among districts, but it is apparent that such representation does not depend solely on mathematical equality among district populations. . . .  An unrealistic overemphasis on raw population figures, a mere nose count in the districts, may submerge these other considerations and itself furnish a ready tool for ignoring factors that in day-to-day operation are important to an acceptable representation and apportionment arrangement."</p>\n<p>412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html#748">412 U. S. 748</a></span>-749.</p>\n<p>Bringing together our state legislative and congressional cases does not imply overlooking relevant differences between the two.  States normally draw a larger number of legislative districts, which accordingly require a greater margin to account for geographical and political boundaries.  "[C]ongressional districts are not so intertwined and freighted with strictly local interests as are state legislative districts."  <em>White v. Weiser,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/case.html#793">412 U. S. 793</a></span>.  Furthermore, because congressional districts are generally much larger than state legislative districts, each percentage point of variation represents a commensurately greater number of people.  But these are differences of degree.  They suggest that the level at which courts should entertain challenges to districting plans, absent unusual circumstances, should be lower in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 462 U. S. 782</a></p><p> congressional cases, but not altogether nonexistent. [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>]  Although I am not wedded to a precise figure, in light of the current range of population deviations, a 5% cutoff appears reasonable.  I would not entertain judicial challenges, absent extraordinary circumstances, where the maximum deviation is less than 5%.  Somewhat greater deviations, if rationally related to an important state interest, may also be permissible.

At a minimum, the Court should vacate the decision of the District Court and remand for further consideration.

Indeed, the Court indicates that "any number of consistently applied legislative policies" might do so.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#740">462 U.

The failure to quantify uncertainty exactly does not excuse pretending that it does not exist.  When the question is whether the range of error is 1% or 2% or 2.5% and the deviation at hand is no larger than 0.6984%, the question is more academic than practical.  Moreover, if a fixed benchmark were required, the margin of error officially recognized by the Census Bureau -- last estimated at 2.3% -- could easily be selected.</p>\n<p>The Court also makes much of the fact that the precise amount of variation in undercounting among districts cannot be known with certainty.  The relevant point, however, is that these district-to-district variances make it impossible to determine with statistical confidence whether opting for the plan with the smallest maximum deviation is ameliorating or aggravating actual equality of population among the districts.  In addition, the count of individuals per district depends upon the Census Bureau\'s selection of geographic boundaries by which to group data.</p>\n<p>"Data from the 1980 census have been compiled for congressional districts by equating component census geographic areas to each district and summing all data for areas coded to the district.

Thus, completely aside from undercounting effects, it is obvious that even absolute numerical equality between the census figures for congressional districts does not reflect districts of equal size.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court dismisses the entire concept of statistical error with the sophistic comment that,</p>\n<p>"[e]ven if one cannot say with certainty that one district is larger than another merely because it has a higher census count, one <em>can</em> say with certainty that the district with a larger census count is more likely to be larger than the other district than it is to be smaller or the same size."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#738">462 U.

The relevant consideration is not whether District Four is larger than District Six, but how much larger, and, how much less larger under the selected plan <em>vis-a-vis</em> an alternative plan.  Moreover, variable undercounting and differences between census units and district lines may result in other districts having higher maximum deviations.</p>\n<p>The general point is that, when the numbers become so small, it makes no sense to concentrate on ever finer gradations when one cannot even be certain whether doing so increases or decreases actual population variances.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>In New Jersey, for example, population growth during the 1970\'s enlarged some districts by up to 26%, while other congressional districts lost up to 8.7% of their 1970 population.

Nevertheless, after reviewing the recent redistricting throughout the country, one commentator offered the following assessment:</p>\n<p>"The nobly aimed \'one-man, one-vote\' principle is coming into increasing use as a weapon for state legislators bent on partisan gerrymandering.  From California to New Jersey and points in between, Republicans and Democrats alike are justifying highly partisan remaps by demonstrating respect for the 1964 Supreme Court mandate that population of congressional districts within states must be made as equal as possible.  Meanwhile, other interests at stake in redistricting -- such as the preservation of community boundaries and the grouping of constituencies with similar concerns -- are being brushed aside. . . .  The emphasis on one-man, one-vote not only permits gerrymandering, it encourages it.  In many states, it is impossible to approach population equality without crossing city, county and township lines.  Once the legislature recognizes that move must be made, it is only a short step further to the drawing of a line that dances jaggedly through every region of the state.  Local interests, informed that it is no longer legally permissible to draw a whole-county congressional map in most states, are far less likely to object than they were in the past. . . .  The court\'s decision to reject a tiny deviation in favor of an even smaller one may further encourage the hairsplitting numbers game that has given rise to partisan gerrymanders all over the country."</p>\n<p>Congressional Quarterly, Inc., State Politics and Redistricting 1-2 (1982).  <em>See also</em> Engstrom, The Supreme Court and Equipopulous Gerrymandering:  A Remaining Obstacle in the Quest for Fair and Effective Representation, 1976 Ariz.State L.J. 277, 278 ("Not only has the Court failed to develop effective checks on the practice of gerrymandering, but, in pursuing the goal of population equality to a point of satiety, it has actually facilitated that practice"); Baker, One Man, One Vote, and "Political Fairness," 23 Emory L.J. 701, 710 (1974) (hereafter Baker) ("Priority was typically given to miniscule population variations at the expense of any recognition of political subdivisions.

Rockefeller</em> is instructive.</p>\n<p>"Subsequent congressional districting in New York became a possible prototype for the \'equal-population gerrymander.\'  Whereas the former district pattern nullified by the Supreme Court had been the result of bipartisan compromise with each major party controlling one house, by 1970, the Republicans held both legislative houses, as well as the governorship.  The assistant counsel to the senate majority leader (and chief coordinator of the redistricting) candidly remarked:  \'The Supreme Court is just making gerrymandering easier than it used to be.\'  Not only was New York City subjected to major cartographic surgery, but upstate cities were also fragmented, with portions being joined to suburban and rural areas in an attempt to dilute concentrations of Democrats."</p>\n<p>Baker, at 712-713.

As JUSTICE STEVENS observes, if a State\'s electoral rules</p>\n<p>"serve no purpose other than to favor one segment -- whether racial, ethnic, religious, economic, or political -- that may occupy a position of strength at a particular point in time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment of the community, they violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#748">462 U. S. 748</a></span> (concurring opinion).  Moreover, most gerrymandering produces districts "without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines," <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 578</span>-579 (1964), a result that is profoundly destructive of the apportionment goal of "fair and effective representation," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 565</span>.  A legislator cannot represent his constituents properly -- nor can voters from a fragmented district exercise the ballot intelligently -- when a voting district is nothing more than an artificial unit divorced from, and indeed often in conflict with, the various communities established in the State. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]  The map attached to the Court\'s opinion [omitted] illustrates this far better than words can describe.</p>\n<p>I therefore am prepared to entertain constitutional challenges to partisan gerrymandering that reaches the level of discrimination described by JUSTICE STEVENS.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#748">462 U. S. 748</a></span> (concurring opinion).  I do not suggest that the shape of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 462 U. S. 788</a></p><p> districting map itself invariably is dispositive.  Some irregularity in shape is inevitable, with the degree of irregularity depending primarily on the geographic and political boundaries within the State, as well as the distribution of its population.  Moreover, political considerations, even partisan ones, are inherent in a democratic system.  A court therefore, should not "attemp[t] the impossible task of extirpating politics from what are the essentially political processes of the sovereign States."  <em>Gaffney,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/case.html#754">412 U. S. 754</a></span>.  Finally, I do not suggest that a legislative reapportionment plan is invalid whenever an alternative plan might be viewed as less partisan or more in accord with various apportionment criteria.  The state legislature necessarily must have discretion to accommodate competing considerations.</p>\n<p>I do believe, however, that the constitutional mandate of "fair and effective representation," <em>Reynolds, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 565</span>, proscribes apportionment plans that have the purpose and effect of substantially disenfranchising identifiable groups of voters.  Generally, the presumptive existence of such unconstitutional discrimination will be indicated by a districting plan the boundaries of which appear on their face to bear little or no relationship to any legitimate state purpose.  As JUSTICE STEVENS states, "dramatically irregular shapes may have sufficient probative force to call for an explanation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#755">462 U. S. 755</a></span> (concurring opinion); "drastic departures from compactness are a signal that something may be amiss," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#758">462 U. S. 758</a></span>; and "[e]xtensive deviation from established political boundaries is another possible basis for a <em>prima facie</em> showing of gerrymandering," <em>ibid.</em>  In such circumstances, a State should be required to provide a legitimate and nondiscriminatory explanation for the districting lines it has drawn.  <em>See Reynolds, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 568</span> (the apportionment "presented little more than crazy quilts, completely lacking in rationality, and could be found invalid on that basis alone").</p>\n<p>In this case, one cannot rationally believe that the New Jersey Legislature considered factors other than the most </p><p><a class="page-number" name="789">Page 462 U. S. 789</a></p><p> partisan political goals and population equality.  It hardly could be suggested, for example, that the contorted Districts 3, 5, and 7 reflect any attempt to follow natural, historical, or local political boundaries. [<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]  Nor do these district lines reflect any consideration of the likely effect on the quality of representation when the boundaries are so artificial that they are likely to confound the Congressmen themselves.  As Judge Gibbons stated eloquently in his dissent below:</p>\n<p>"The apportionment map produced by P. L.1982, c. 1 leaves me, as a citizen of New Jersey, disturbed.  It creates several districts which are anything but compact, and at least one district which is contiguous only for yachtsmen.  While municipal boundaries have been maintained, there has been little effort to create districts having a community of interests.  In some districts, for example, different television and radio stations, different newspapers, and different transportation systems serve the northern and southern localities.  Moreover, the harshly partisan tone of Speaker Christopher Jackman\'s letter to Ernest C. Reock, Jr. is disedifying, to say the least.  It is plain, as well, that partisanship produced artificial bulges or appendages of two districts so as to place the residences of Congressmen Smith and Courter in districts where they would be running against incumbents."</p>\n<p><em>Daggett v. Kimmelman,</em> 535 F.Supp. 978, 984 (NJ 1982).</p>\n<p>This summary statement by Judge Gibbons, a resident of New Jersey, is powerful and persuasive support for a conclusion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="790">Page 462 U. S. 790</a></p><p> that the New Jersey Legislature\'s redistricting plan is an unconstitutional gerrymander.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#764">462 U. S. 764</a></span>, n. 33 (STEVENS, J., concurring).  Because this precise issue was not addressed by the District Court, however, it need not be reached here.  As to the issue of population equality, I dissent for the reasons set forth above and in JUSTICE WHITE\'s dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/1" name="F4/1">Footnote 4/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court holds that</p>\n<p>"[a]ny number of consistently applied legislative policies might justify some variance, including, for instance, making districts compact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#740">462 U. S. 740</a></span>.  Although it is remarkable that the Court thus silently discards important features of <em>Kirkpatrick</em> while simultaneously invoking <em>stare decisis</em> to defend the remainder of that decision, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#778">462 U. S. 778</a></span>-780 (WHITE,J., dissenting), I welcome this change in the law.  It is to be hoped that this new standard will be applied with a strong measure of deference to the legitimate concerns of the State.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#760">462 U. S. 760</a></span>, n. 26 (STEVENS,J., concurring) (recognizing that courts should "give greater weight to the importance of the State\'s interests and the consistency with which those interests are served than to the size of the deviations").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/2" name="F4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]</p>\n<p>An illustration is the recent congressional redistricting in Illinois.  After the Illinois Legislature had failed to enact a reapportionment plan, a three-judge District Court chose among four plans varying from 0.02851% to O. 14797% in maximum deviation.  Following <em>Kirkpatrick,</em> the majority of the court chose the plan with the smallest deviation, one that was a "Democratic plan" designed to maximize Democratic voting strength at the expense of Republicans.  <em>See In re Illinois Congressional Districts Reapportionment Cases,</em> No. 81-C-3915 (ND Ill.1981), <em>summarily aff\'d sub nom. Ryan v. Otto,</em> 454 U.S. 1130 (1982).  A commentator noted:</p>\n<p>"The Democratic victory was due in part to a sophisticated computer program that made possible the creation of districts having almost exactly equal population.  The most populous district has only 171 more people than the least populous one.  That accuracy seemed to impress the court, which expressed no concern that the new district lines divided cities and carved up counties all over the state."</p>\n<p>Illinois Map is Unpleasant Surprise for the GOP, 40 Congressional Quarterly 573 (1982).  <em>See also Carstens v. Lamm,</em> 543 F.Supp. 68, 73-74, and 84, n. 39 (Colo.1982) (three-judge District Court reviewed five major redistricting plans, including the Republican legislature\'s plan with a difference between largest and smallest districts of seven persons, <em>i.e.,</em> a maximum deviation of 0.0015%, and the Democratic Governor\'s plan with a 15-person difference, <em>i.e.,</em> a maximum deviation of 0.0031%); <em>O\'Sullivan v. Brier,</em> 540 F.Supp. 1200, 1202 (Kan.1982) (three-judge District Court asked to choose between a Democratic plan with a 0.11% maximum deviation and a Republican plan with a 0.09% maximum deviation).</p>\n<p>These cases also illustrate an additional unfortunate side effect of <em>Kirkpatrick:</em>  the increasing tendency of state legislators and Governors -- who have learned that any redistricting plan is "vulnerable to after-the-fact attack by anyone with a complaint and a calculator," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html#778">462 U. S. 778</a></span> (WHITE, J., dissenting) -- to spurn compromise in favor of simply drawing up the most partisan plan that appears consistent with the population equality criterion.  No longer do federal district courts merely review the constitutionality of a State\'s redistricting plan.  Rather, in many cases, they are placed in the position of choosing a redistricting plan in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/3" name="F4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Carstens v. Lamm, supra,</em> the three-judge District Court noted that preserving an entire city as one voting district facilitated "voter identity":</p>\n<p>"Most voters know what city and county they live in, but fewer are likely to know what congressional district they live in if the districts split counties and cities.  If a voter knows his congressional district, he is more likely to know who his representative is.  This presumably would lead to more informed voting."</p>\n<p>543 F.Supp. at 98, n. 78.  It also is likely to lead to a Representative who knows the needs of his district and is more responsive to them.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/4" name="F4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]</p>\n<p>It may be noted, for example, that the plan adopted by New Jersey (the Feldman Plan) divided the State\'s 21 counties into 55 fragments.  The plan proposed by Professor Reock, introduced by Assemblyman Hardwick, created 45 county fragments, and the existing congressional districts divided the counties into 42 fragments.  <em>See</em> App. 123 (Appendix A to Affidavit of Samuel A. Alito, Executive Director of the Office of Legislative Services of the New Jersey Legislature).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
