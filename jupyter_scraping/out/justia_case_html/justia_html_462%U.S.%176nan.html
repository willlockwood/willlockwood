Appellants challenge the pass-through prohibition and the royalty owner exemption under the Supremacy Clause, the Contract Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Since 1945 Alabama has imposed a severance tax on oil and gas extracted from wells located in the State.  Ala.Code \xc2\xa7 40-20-1 <em>et seq.</em> (197).  The tax</p>\n<p>"is levied upon the producers of such oil or gas in the proportion of their ownership at the time of severance, but . . . shall be paid by the person in charge of the production operations."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 40-20-3(a). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The person in charge of production operations is</p>\n<p>"authorized, empowered and required to deduct from any amount due to producers of such production at the time of severance the proportionate amount of the tax herein levied before making payments to such producers."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 40-20-3(a).  The statute defines a "producer" as "[a]ny person engaging or continuing in the business of oil or gas production," including</p>\n<p>"the owning, controlling, managing, or leasing of any oil or gas property or oil or gas well, and producing in any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="179">Page 462 U. S. 179</a></p><p> manner any oil or gas . . . and . . . receiving money or other valuable consideration as royalty or rental for oil or gas produced. . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 40-20-1(8).</p>\n<p>In 1979, the Alabama Legislature enacted Act 79-434, which increased the severance tax from 4% to 6% of the gross value of the oil and gas at the point of production.  Whereas the severance tax had previously fallen on royalty owners in proportion to their interests in the oil or gas produced, the amendment specifically exempted royalty owners from the tax increase:</p>\n<p>"Any person who is a royalty owner shall be exempt from the payment of any increase in taxes herein levied and shall not be liable therefor."</p>\n<p>1979 Ala. Acts, No. 79-434, p. 687, \xc2\xa7 1, as amended, Ala.Code \xc2\xa7 40-202(d) (1982).  The amendment also prohibited producers from passing the tax increase through to consumers:</p>\n<p>"The privilege tax herein levied shall be absorbed and paid by those persons engaged in the business of producing or severing oil or gas only, and the producer shall not pass on the costs of such tax payments, either directly or indirectly, to the consumer; it being the express intent of this act that the tax herein levied shall be borne exclusively by the producer or severer of oil or gas."</p>\n<p>1979 Ala. Acts, No. 79-434, p. 687, \xc2\xa7 1(e).  The amendment became effective on September 1, 1979.  The pass-through prohibition was repealed on May 28, 1980.  1980 Ala. Acts, No. 80-708, p. 1438.</p>\n<p>Appellants in both No. 81-1020 and No. 81-1268 have working interests in producing oil and gas wells located in Alabama. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They drill and operate the wells and are responsible for selling the oil and gas extracted.  Appellants are obligated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="180">Page 462 U. S. 180</a></p><p> to pay the landowners a percentage of the sale proceeds as royalties, the percentage depending upon the provisions of the applicable lease.  Within any given production unit, there may be tracts of land which the owners of the land have leased to nonworking interests, who are also entitled to a share of the sale proceeds.  Appellants were parties to contracts providing for the allocation of severance taxes among themselves, the royalty owners, and any nonworking interests in proportion to each party\'s share of the sale proceeds.  Appellants were also parties to sale contracts that required the purchasers to reimburse them for any and all severance taxes on the oil or gas sold.</p>\n<p>After paying the 2% increase in the severance tax under protest, appellants and eight other oil and gas producers filed suit in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Ala., seeking a declaratory judgment that Act 79-434 was unconstitutional and a refund of the taxes paid under protest.  The Circuit Court ruled in favor of appellants, concluding that both the royalty owner exemption and the pass-through prohibition violate the Equal Protection Clause and the Contract Clause, and that the pass-through prohibition is also preempted by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3301 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. V).  Although Act 79-434 contained a severability clause, the court held the entire Act invalid, and ordered appellee Commissioner of Revenue of the State of Alabama to refund the taxes paid under protest.  The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed, holding Act 79-434 valid in its entirety.  404 So.2d 1 (1981).</p>\n<p>Appellants appealed to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1257(2).  We noted probable jurisdiction.  456 U.S. 970 (1982).  We now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We deal first with appellants\' contention that the application of the pass-through prohibition to gas was preempted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 462 U. S. 181</a></p><p> by federal law. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The applicable principles of preemption were recently summarized in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

Even where Congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in a specific area, state law is preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.  Such a conflict arises when \'compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\' <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/373/132/case.html">373 U. S. 132</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/373/132/case.html#142">373 U.

S. 67</a></span> (1941)."</p>\n<p>Appellants contend that the pass-through prohibition was in conflict with \xc2\xa7 110(a) of the NGPA, 92 Stat. 3368, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3320(a) (1976 ed., Supp. V), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p>"[A] price for the first sale of natural gas shall not be considered to exceed the maximum lawful price applicable </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 462 U. S. 183</a></p><p> to the first sale of such natural gas under this part if such first sale price exceeds the maximum lawful price to the extent necessary to recover -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) State severance taxes attributable to the production of such natural gas and borne by the seller. . . ."</p>\n<p>We agree with the Supreme Court of Alabama [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] that the pass-through prohibition did not conflict with this provision.  On its face, \xc2\xa7 110(a) of the NGPA does not give any seller the affirmative right to include in his price an amount necessary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 462 U. S. 184</a></p><p> to recover state severance taxes.  It simply provides that a seller who does include such an amount in his price shall not be deemed to have exceeded the federal price ceiling if he would not have exceeded it had that amount not been included.  Nothing in the legislative history of the NGPA has been called to our attention to indicate that \xc2\xa7 110(a) was intended to have a greater effect than its language would indicate. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the pass-through prohibition thus was not in conflict with \xc2\xa7 110(a) of the NGPA, we nevertheless conclude that it was preempted by federal law insofar as it applied to sales of gas in interstate commerce.  To that extent, the pass-through prohibition represented an attempt to legislate in a field that Congress has chosen to occupy.  The Natural Gas Act (Gas Act), 52 Stat. 821, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 717-717w (1976 ed. and Supp. V), was enacted in 1938</p>\n<p>"to provide the Federal Power Commission, now the FERC, with authority to regulate the wholesale pricing of natural gas in the flow of interstate commerce from wellhead to delivery to consumers."</p>\n<p><em>Maryland v.

The Committee Reports on the bill that became the Gas Act clearly evidence this intent:</p>\n<p>"[S]ales for resale, or so-called wholesale sales, in interstate commerce (for example, sales by producing companies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 462 U.

Whether or not producers should be permitted to recover this expense from their purchasers is a matter within the sphere of FERC\'s regulatory authority.  <em>See FPC v.

We reach a different conclusion with respect to the application of the pass-through prohibition to sales of gas in intrastate commerce. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Although \xc2\xa7 105(a) of the NGPA extended federal authority to control prices to the intrastate market, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3315(a) (1976 ed., Supp. V), Congress also provided that this extension of federal authority did not deprive the States of the power to establish a price ceiling for intrastate producer sales of gas at a level lower than the federal ceiling.  Section 602(a) of the NGPA, 92 Stat. 3411, as set forth in 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3432(a) (1976 ed., Supp. V), states that</p>\n<p>"[n]othing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any State to establish or enforce any maximum lawful price for the first sale of natural gas produced in such State which does not exceed the applicable maximum lawful price, if any, under subchapter I of this chapter."</p>\n<p><em>See Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v.

For sellers charging the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 462 U. S. 187</a></p><p> maximum price allowed by federal law, a state tax increase coupled with a pass-through prohibition will not differ in practical effect from a state tax increase coupled with the imposition of a state price ceiling that maintains the price ceiling imposed by federal law prior to the tax increase.  In both cases, sellers are required to absorb expenses that they might be able to pass through to their customers absent the state restrictions.  Given the absence of any express preemption provision in the NGPA and Congress\' express approval of one form of state regulation, we do not think it can fairly be inferred that Congress contemplated that the general scheme created by the NGPA would preclude another form of state regulation that is no more intrusive. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude that the pass-through prohibition was preempted by federal law insofar as it applied to sales of gas in interstate commerce, but not insofar as it applied to producer sales of gas in intrastate commerce.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We turn next to appellants\' contention that the royalty owner exemption and the pass-through prohibition impaired the obligations of contracts in violation of the Contract Clause. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellants\' Contract Clause challenge to the royalty owner exemption fails for the simple reason that there is nothing to suggest that that exemption nullified any contractual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 462 U. S. 188</a></p><p> obligations of which appellants were the beneficiaries. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The relevant provision of Act 79-434 states that "[a]ny person who is a royalty owner shall be exempt from the payment of any increase in taxes levied and shall not be liable therefor."  On its face, this portion of the Act provides only that the legal incidence of the tax increase does not fall on royalty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 462 U. S. 189</a></p><p> owners, <em>i.e.,</em> the State cannot look to them for payment of the additional taxes.  In contrast to the pass-through prohibition, the royalty owner exemption nowhere states that producers may not shift the burden of the tax increase in whole or in part to royalty owners.  Nor is there anything in the opinion below to suggest that the Supreme Court of Alabama interpreted the exemption to have this effect.  We will not strain to reach a constitutional question by speculating that the Alabama courts might in the future interpret the royalty owner exemption to forbid enforcement of a contractual arrangement to shift the burden of the tax increase.  <em>See Ashwander v. TVA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U. S. 288</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html#346">297 U.

Appellants were parties to sale contracts that permitted them to include in their prices any increase in the severance taxes that they were required to pay on the oil or gas being sold. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The contracts were entered into before the pass-through prohibition was enacted, and their terms extended through the period during which the prohibition was in effect.  By barring appellants from passing the tax increase through to their purchasers, the pass-through prohibition nullified <em>pro tanto</em> the purchasers\' contractual obligations to reimburse appellants for any severance taxes.</p>\n<p>While the pass-through prohibition thus affects contractual obligations of which appellants were the beneficiaries, it does not follow that the prohibition constituted a "Law impairing the Obligations of Contracts" within the meaning of the Contract </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 462 U.

The effect of the pass-through prohibition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 462 U.

The statute required a private employer that had contracted with its employees to provide pension benefits to pay additional benefits, beyond those it had agreed to provide, if it terminated the pension plan or closed a Minnesota office.

In that case, the Court upheld an order issued by a state commission under a newly enacted statute empowering the commission to set the rates that could be charged by individuals or corporations offering to transport oil by pipeline.  The Court rejected the contention of a pipeline owner that the statute could not override preexisting contracts:</p>\n<p>"That some of the contracts . . . were entered into before the statute was adopted or the order made is not material.  A common carrier cannot, by making contracts for future transportation or by mortgaging its property or pledging its income, prevent or postpone the exertion by the State of the power to regulate the carrier\'s rates and practices.

If a party that has entered into a contract to transport oil is not immune from subsequently enacted state regulation of the rates that may be charged for such transportation, parties that have entered into contracts to sell oil and gas likewise are not immune from state regulation of the prices that may be charged for those commodities.  And if the Contract Clause does not prevent a State from dictating the price that sellers may charge their customers, plainly it does not prevent a State from requiring that sellers absorb a tax increase themselves, rather than pass it through to their customers.  If one form of state regulation is permissible under the Contract Clause notwithstanding its incidental effect on preexisting contracts, the other form of regulation must be permissible as well.

Houston County Dept. of Pensions &amp; Security,</em> 358 So.2d 451, 455 (Civ.App.), <em>cert. denied,</em> 358 So.2d 456 (Ala.1978).</p>\n<p>Appellants in No. 81-1268 have also burdened this Court with a labored argument that they were denied due process by the Supreme Court of Alabama\'s refusal to consider the legislative history of the 1979 amendments to the state severance tax, a history which, according to appellants, shows that those amendments were intended to apply only to certain wells located in one county in the State, and not to apply statewide.  Suffice it to say that the weight to be given to the legislative history of an Alabama statute is a matter of Alabama law, to be determined by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 404 So.2d at 6:</p>\n<p>"Nowhere in that section [\xc2\xa7 110(a) of the NGPA] is it stated that the oil companies are entitled to \'pass through\' increases on state severance taxes.  Rather, the Act merely provides that the lawful ceiling on the first sale at the wellhead may be raised if a severance tax is imposed by the states.  The two Acts are aimed at entirely different purposes.  In other words, although it would be perfectly permissible for the oil and gas companies to raise the price for the first sale of natural gas, subject to the limitations of the Natural Gas Policy Act, all that Act No. 79-434 requires is that the increase in severance tax mandated by that Act be borne by the producer or severer of the oil or gas."</p>\n<p>Relying on this passage, appellee Commissioner of Revenue contends that the pass-through prohibition did not bar a producer from increasing its price by an amount equal to the increase in the severance tax, provided that the producer did not label that increase a tax:</p>\n<p>"The Commissioner believes that the seller may include in the lawful maximum price an amount equal to Alabama\'s severance taxes borne by the seller resulting from the production of natural gas.  The Commissioner believes that it was the intent of the Alabama Legislature in adopting the pass-through prohibition that it did not want to be perceived as levying an additional tax on the consumer.  Therefore it prohibited anyone from passing along the increase levied by Act 79-434 <em>as a tax.</em>"</p>\n<p>Brief for Appellee Eagerton 16-17 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>We do not agree with appellee that the Supreme Court of Alabama interpreted the pass-through prohibition to leave sellers free to pass through the tax increase so long as they did not tell their customers that that is what they were doing.  The statute contains no language that would suggest this limitation, and, as we understand the opinion below, the point of the passage relied upon by appellee was only that the pass-through prohibition did not conflict with federal law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the United States and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in their <em>amicus</em> brief point to the statement in the Conference Report that "[a]ll ceiling prices under this Act are exclusive of State severance taxes borne by the seller . . . ," H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1752, p. 90 (1978), we do not see how this statement supports their position that the pass-through prohibition was in conflict with \xc2\xa7 110(a).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The parties stipulated that a substantial portion of the gas extracted by appellants was sold in interstate commerce.  App. in No. 81-1020, pp. 78, 184-185.  Because the trial court concluded that the pass-through prohibition was in conflict with \xc2\xa7 110(a) of the NGPA, it did not determine how much of the taxes at issue in this case were levied on gas sold in intrastate and interstate commerce.  If, on remand, when the Supreme Court of Alabama inquires into the question of severability, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/176/case.html#196">462 U. S. 196</a></span>-197, that court holds that the Alabama Legislature would have intended to impose the tax increase on the severance of gas if and only if the increase could not be passed through to consumers when the gas is sold, such a determination may have to be made.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>We note that these cases do not involve any attempt by a State to prohibit gas producers from passing through the cost of a factor of production such as labor or machinery.  Such a prohibition might raise additional considerations not present here because of the inducement it would create for producers to shift away from the factor of production to which the pass-through prohibition applied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The Contract Clause provides that "No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts. . . ."  U.S.Const., Art. I, 10, cl. 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The contracts into which appellants had entered appear to entitle them to reimbursement from the royalty owners for a share of any severance tax paid by appellants in proportion to the royalty owners\' interest in the oil or gas, regardless of whether state law imposes that tax on the producer or on the royalty owner.  Appellants cite the following contractual provisions as typical of the agreements which they contend are impaired by the royalty owner exemption:</p>\n<p>"Lessor shall bear and pay, and there shall be deducted from the royalties due hereunder, Lessor\'s proportionate royalty share of:"</p>\n<p>"(a) All applicable severance, production and other such taxes levied or imposed upon production from the leased premises."</p>\n<p>App. in No. 81-1020, pp. 76-77.</p>\n<p>"LESSOR AND LESSEE shall bear in proportion to their respective participation in the production hereunder, all taxes levied on minerals covered hereby or any part thereof, or on the severance or production thereof, and all increases . . . in taxes on the lease premises or any part thereof."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 184.  These provisions would seem to entitle appellants to recover from the royalty owners a portion of the tax increase in proportion to the royalty owners\' interests in the proceeds of the oil or gas sold by appellants, regardless of the legal incidence of the tax increase.</p>\n<p>Even if these contractual provisions were to be interpreted to entitle appellants to reimbursement only for that portion of the severance tax which state law itself imposes on the royalty owners, appellants would still have no objection under the Contract Clause.  In that event, the increase in the severance tax would be absorbed by appellants not because the State has nullified any contractual obligation, but simply because the provisions as so interpreted would impose no obligation on the royalty owners to reimburse appellants for the tax increase.</p>\n<p>Since appellants have not shown that the royalty owner exemption affects anything other than the legal incidence of the tax increase, their contention that the exemption is preempted by the Gas Act and the NGPA is plainly without merit.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, appellant Union Oil Co. was a party to a contract concerning oil under which the purchaser was required to reimburse it for "100 percent of the amount by which any severance taxes paid by seller are in excess of the rates of such taxes levied as of April 1, 1976."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>This point was aptly stated in an early decision holding that a statute prohibiting the issuance of notes by unincorporated banking associations did not violate the Contract Clause by preventing the performance of existing contracts entered into by members of such associations:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is said that the members had formed a contract between themselves which would be dissolved by the stoppage of their business.  And what then?  Is that such a violation of contracts as is prohibited by the constitution of the United State?  Consider to what such a construction would lead.  Let us suppose that, in one of the states, there is no law against gaming, cock-fighting, horse-racing, or public masquerades, and that companies should be formed for the purpose of carrying on these practices.  And suppose that the legislature of that state, being [seriously] convinced of the pernicious effect of these institutions, should venture to interdict them:  will it be seriously contended, that the constitution of the United States has been violated?"</p>\n<p><em>Myers v.

During the time the pass-through prohibition was in effect, the Federal Government controlled the prices of crude oil under the EPAA, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 751 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V).

In <em>Barwise,</em> the owners of royalty interests challenged a Texas statute that imposed a new tax on oil production, which was to be borne "ratably by all interested parties, including royalty interests."  The statute authorized the producers to pay the tax and withhold from any royalty owners their proportionate share of the tax.  The royalty owners in <em>Barwise</em> were parties to contracts that entitled them to specified shares of the oil produced by their lessee and required the lessee to deliver the oil "free of cost."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/33/case.html#35">299 U. S. 35</a></span>.  They contended that the statute, by authorizing the lessee to deduct their portion of the tax from any payments due them, impermissibly impaired the lessee\'s obligation to deliver the oil "free of cost."  This Court concluded that the statute did not run afoul of the Contract Clause:</p>\n<p>"[T]he lease was made in subordination to the power of the State to tax the production of oil and to apportion the tax between the lessors and the lessee. . . .  Plainly no stipulation in the lease can be of any avail as against the power of the State to impose the tax, prescribe who shall be under a duty to the State to pay it, and fix the time and mode of payment.  And this is true even though it be assumed to be admissible for the lessors and lessee to stipulate as to who, as between themselves, shall ultimately bear the tax."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/33/case.html#40">299 U. S. 40</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We reject appellants\' assertion that the last sentence of this quotation was meant to indicate that the statute would have violated the Contract Clause if, instead of simply specifying the legal incidence of the tax, it had nullified an agreement as to who would ultimately bear the burden of the tax.  We think the thrust of the sentence was simply that, even though the law left the lessors and the lessee free to allocate the ultimate burden of the tax as they saw fit, no agreement between them could limit the State\'s power to decide who must pay the tax and to specify the time and manner of payment.</p>\n<p><em>Barwise</em> is relevant to these cases only insofar as it confirms Alabama\'s power to decide that no part of the legal incidence of the increase in the severance tax would fall on owners of royalty interests.  <em>See<em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/176/case.html#187"> Part III-A, </a></span></em>supra.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
