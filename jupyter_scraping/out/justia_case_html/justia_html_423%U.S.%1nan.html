As used in this decree, the term "coastline" means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.</p>\n<p>2. As against the United States, each defendant State is entitled to all the lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Atlantic Ocean extending seaward from its coastline for a distance of three geographic miles, and the United States is not entitled, as against any of the defendant States, to any interest in such lands, minerals, or resources, with the exceptions provided by \xc2\xa7 5 of the Submerged Lands Act of 153, 67 Stat. 32, 43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1313.</p>\n<p>3. Jurisdiction is reserved by this Court to entertain such further proceedings, including proceedings to determine the coastline of any defendant State, to enter such orders, and to issue such writs as may from time to time be deemed necessary or advisable to give proper force and effect to this decree.  The United States or any defendant State may invoke the jurisdiction so reserved by filing a motion in this Court for supplemental proceedings.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
