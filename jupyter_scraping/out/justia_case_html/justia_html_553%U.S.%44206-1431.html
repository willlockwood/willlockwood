The Seventh Circuit affirmed on the direct discrimination claim, but remanded for a trial on Humphries\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa71981 retaliation claim, rejecting CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 argument that \xc2\xa71981 did not encompass such a claim.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 1981 encompasses retaliation claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because this conclusion rests in significant part upon <em>stare decisis </em>principles<em>, </em>the Court examines the pertinent interpretive history.  (1) In 1969, <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a>, 237, as later interpreted and relied on by <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a>, 176, recognized that retaliation actions are encompassed by 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 shall have the same right, \xe2\x80\xa6 , as is enjoyed by white citizens \xe2\x80\xa6 to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\xe2\x80\x9d  (2) This Court has long interpreted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 alike because they were enacted together, have common language, and serve the same purpose of providing black citizens the same legal rights as enjoyed by other citizens.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html">427 U. S. 160</a>, 183, 197, 190.  (3) In 1989, <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 177, without mention of retaliation, narrowed \xc2\xa71981 by excluding from its scope conduct occurring after formation of the employment contract, where retaliation would most likely be found.  Subsequently, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which was designed to supersede <em>Patterson, </em>see <em>Jones</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/369/index.html">541 U. S. 369</a>, 383, by explicitly defining \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s scope to include post-contract-formation conduct, \xc2\xa71981(b).  (4) Since 1991, the Federal Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted \xc2\xa71981 as encompassing retaliation actions.  <em>Sullivan, </em>as interpreted by <em>Jackson, </em>as well as a long line of related cases where the Court construes \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 similarly, lead to the conclusion that the view that \xc2\xa71981 encompasses retaliation claims is well embedded in the law.  <em>Stare decisis </em>considerations strongly support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to  that view.  Such considerations impose a considerable burden on those who would seek a different interpretation that would necessarily unsettle many Court precedents.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 several arguments, taken separately or together, cannot justify a departure from this well-embedded interpretation of \xc2\xa71981.  First, while CBOCS is correct that \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s plain text does not expressly refer to retaliation, that alone is not sufficient to carry the day, given this Court\xe2\x80\x99s long recognition that \xc2\xa71982 provides protection against retaliation; <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s recent holding that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 includes an antiretaliation remedy, despite Title IX\xe2\x80\x99s failure to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d 544 U. S., at 173\xe2\x80\x93174, 176; and <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to embrace a similar argument, see 396 U. S., at 241.  Second, contrary to CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 assertion, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to include an <em>explicit </em>antiretaliation provision in its 1991 amendment of \xc2\xa71981 does not demonstrate an intention not to cover retaliation, but is more plausibly explained by the fact that, given <em>Sullivan </em>and the new statutory language nullifying <em>Patterson, </em>there was no need to include explicit retaliation language.  Third, the argument that applying \xc2\xa71981 to employment-related retaliation actions would create an overlap with Title VII, allegedly allowing a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s detailed administrative and procedural mechanisms and thereby undermine their effectiveness, proves too much.  Precisely the same kind of Title VII/\xc2\xa71981 \xe2\x80\x9coverlap\xe2\x80\x9d and potential circumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct discrimination, yet Congress explicitly and intentionally created that overlap, <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/index.html">415 U. S. 36</a>, 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  Fourth, contrary to its arguments, CBOCS cannot find support in <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/53/index.html">548 U. S. 53</a>, 63, and <em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza, Inc.</em> v. <em>McDonald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/470/index.html">546 U. S. 470</a>.  While <em>Burlington</em> distinguished discrimination based on status (<em>e.g.,</em> as women or black persons) from discrimination based on conduct (<em>e.g.,</em> whistle-blowing that leads to retaliation), it did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.  Moreover, while <em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza</em> and other more recent cases may place greater emphasis on statutory language than did <em>Sullivan, </em>any arguable change in interpretive approach would not justify reexamination of well-established prior law under s<em>tare decisis</em> principles.

Stat. \xc2\xa71977, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(a).  The basic question before us is whether the provision encompasses a complaint of retaliation against a person who has complained about a violation of another person\xe2\x80\x99s contract-related \xe2\x80\x9cright.\xe2\x80\x9d  We conclude that it does. </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case before us arises out of a claim by respondent, Hedrick G. Humphries, a former assistant manager of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, that CBOCS West, Inc. (Cracker Barrel\xe2\x80\x99s owner) dismissed him (1) because of racial bias (Humphries is a black man) and (2) because he had complained to managers that a fellow assistant manager had dismissed another black employee, Venus Green, for race-based reasons.  Humphries timely filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), pursuant to 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935, and received a \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d letter.  He then filed a complaint in Federal District Court charging that CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 actions violated both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e <em>et seq</em>., and the older \xe2\x80\x9cequal contract rights\xe2\x80\x9d provision here at issue, \xc2\xa71981.  The District Court dismissed Humphries\xe2\x80\x99 Title VII claims for failure to pay necessary filing fees on a timely basis.  It then granted CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary judgment on Humphries\xe2\x80\x99 two \xc2\xa71981 claims.  Humphries appealed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled against Humphries and upheld the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of summary judgment in respect to his direct discrimination claim.  But it ruled in Humphries\xe2\x80\x99 favor and remanded for a trial in respect to his \xc2\xa71981 retaliation claim.  In doing so, the Court of Appeals rejected CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 argument that \xc2\xa71981 did not encompass a claim of retaliation.  474 F.\xc2\xa03d 387 (2007).  CBOCS sought certiorari, asking us to consider this last-mentioned legal question.  And we agreed to do so.  See 551 U. S.___ (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether \xc2\xa71981 encompasses retaliation claims.  We conclude that it does.  And because our conclusion rests in significant part upon principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>we begin by examining the pertinent interpretive history.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court first considered a comparable question in 1969, in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a>.  The case arose under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982, a statutory provision that Congress enacted just after the Civil War, along with \xc2\xa71981, to protect the rights of black citizens.  The provision was similar to \xc2\xa71981 except that it focused, not upon rights to make and to enforce contracts, but rights related to the ownership of property.  The statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71982.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Paul E. Sullivan<em>, </em>a white man, had rented his house to T. R. Freeman, Jr., a black man.  He had also assigned Freeman a membership share in a corporation, which permitted the owner to use a private park that the corporation controlled.  Because of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s race, the corporation, Little Hunting Park, Inc., refused to approve the share assignment.  And, when Sullivan protested, the association expelled Sullivan and took away his membership shares.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sullivan sued Little Hunting Park, claiming that its actions violated \xc2\xa71982.  The Court upheld Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  It found that the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s refusal \xe2\x80\x9cto approve the assignment of the membership share . . . was clearly an interference with Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s [the black lessee\xe2\x80\x99s] right to \xe2\x80\x98lease.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  396 U. S., at 237.  It added that Sullivan, the white lessor, \xe2\x80\x9chas standing to maintain this action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., because, as the Court had previously said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe white owner is at times \xe2\x80\x98the only effective adversary\xe2\x80\x99 of the unlawful restrictive covenant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a> (1953)).  The Court noted that to permit the corporation to punish Sullivan \xe2\x80\x9cfor trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by \xc2\xa71982\xe2\x80\x9d would give \xe2\x80\x9cimpetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\xe2\x80\x9d  396 U. S., at 237.  And this Court has made clear that <em>Sullivan</em> stands for the proposition that \xc2\xa71982 encompasses retaliation claims.  See <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a>, 176 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n <em>Sullivan</em> we interpreted a general prohibition on racial discrimination [in \xc2\xa71982] to cover retaliation against\nthose who advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the <em>Sullivan</em> decision interpreted \xc2\xa71982, our precedents have long construed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 similarly.  In <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html">427 U. S. 160</a>, 173 (1976), the Court considered whether \xc2\xa71981 prohibits private acts of discrimination.  Citing <em>Sullivan</em>, along with <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/409/index.html">392 U.

S. 431</a> (1973), the Court reasoned that this case law \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily requires the conclusion that \xc2\xa71981, like \xc2\xa71982, reaches private conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  427 U. S., at 173.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 187 (Powell, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough <em>[Sullivan</em> and <em>Jones]</em> involved \xc2\xa71982, rather than \xc2\xa71981, I agree that their considered holdings with respect to the purpose and meaning of \xc2\xa71982 necessarily apply to both statutes in view of their common derivation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would be most incongruous to give those two sections [\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982] a fundamentally different construction\xe2\x80\x9d).

Like \xc2\xa71981, \xc2\xa71982 traces its origin to \xc2\xa71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27.  See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/375/index.html">458 U. S. 375</a>, 383\xe2\x80\x93384 (1982) (noting shared historical roots of the two provisions);<em> Tillman, supra,</em> at 439\xe2\x80\x93440 (same).  Like \xc2\xa71981, \xc2\xa71982 represents an immediately post-Civil War legislative effort to guarantee the then newly freed slaves the same legal rights that other citizens enjoy.  See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., supra,</em> at 388 (noting strong purposive connection between the two provisions).  Like \xc2\xa71981, \xc2\xa71982 uses broad language that says \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s language set forth above, <em>supra</em>, at 1.  See <em>Jones, supra</em>, at 441, n. 78 (noting the close parallel language of the two provisions).  Indeed, \xc2\xa71982 differs from \xc2\xa71981 only in that it refers, not to the \xe2\x80\x9cright . . . to make and enforce contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(a), but to the \xe2\x80\x9cright . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71982.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these precedents, it is not surprising that following <em>Sullivan</em>, federal appeals courts concluded, on the basis of <em>Sullivan</em> or its reasoning,<em> </em>that \xc2\xa71981 encompassed retaliation claims.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Choudhury</em> v. <em>Polytechnic Inst</em>. <em>of N.\xc2\xa0Y.,</em> 735 F.\xc2\xa02d 38, 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (CA2 1984); <em>Goff</em> v. <em>Continental Oil Co</em>., 678 F.\xc2\xa02d 593, 598\xe2\x80\x93599 (CA5 1982), overruled, <em>Carter</em> v. <em>South Central Bell</em>, 912 F.\xc2\xa02d 832 (CA5 1990); <em>Winston</em> v. <em>Lear-Siegler, Inc</em>., 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 1266, 1270 (CA6 1977).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1989, 20 years after <em>Sullivan, </em>this Court in <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, significantly limited the scope of \xc2\xa71981.  The Court focused upon \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cto make and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x9d and interpreted the phrase narrowly.  It wrote that the statutory phrase did not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct by the employer <em>after the contract relation has been established</em>, including breach of the terms of the contract or imposition of discriminatory working conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 177 (emphasis added).  The Court added that the word \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d does not apply to post-contract-formation conduct unless the discrimination at issue \xe2\x80\x9c<em>infects the legal process</em> in ways that prevent one from enforcing contract rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  Thus \xc2\xa71981 did not encompass the claim of a black employee who charged that her employer had violated her employment contract by harassing her and failing to promote her, all because of her race.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since victims of an employer\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation will often have opposed discriminatory conduct taking place after </em>the formation of the employment contract, <em>Patterson\xe2\x80\x99</em>s holding, for a brief time, seems in practice to have foreclosed retaliation claims.  With one exception, we have found no federal court of appeals decision between the time we decided <em>Patterson</em> and 1991 that permitted a \xc2\xa71981 retaliation claim to proceed.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Walker</em> v. <em>South Central Bell Tel.

Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa7101, 105 Stat. 1071, with the design to supersede <em>Patterson</em>.  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0R.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981 by reenacting the former provision, designating it as \xc2\xa71981(a), and adding a new subsection, (b), which, says:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Make and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x99 defined</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of this section, the term \xe2\x80\x98make and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x99 includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An accompanying Senate Report pointed out that the amendment superseded <em>Patterson </em>by adding a new subsection (b) that would \xe2\x80\x9creaffirm that the right \xe2\x80\x98to make and enforce contracts\xe2\x80\x99 includes the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, pt. 1, pp. 92\xe2\x80\x9393, n. 92 (1991).  It added that the protections that subsection (b) provided, in \xe2\x80\x9cthe context of employment discrimination\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0would include, but not be limited to, claims of harassment, discharge, demotion, promotion, transfer, <em>retaliation</em>, and hiring.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 92 (emphasis added).

See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>1115 Legal Serv. Care</em>, 163 F.\xc2\xa03d 684, 693 (CA2 1998); <em>Aleman </em>v. <em>Chugach Support Servs., Inc</em>., 485 F.\xc2\xa03d 206, 213\xe2\x80\x93214 (CA4 2007); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>University of Houston System</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 333, 338\xe2\x80\x93339 (CA5 2003); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>University of Cincinnati</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 561, 575\xe2\x80\x93576 (CA6 2000); 474 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 403 (case below); <em>Manatt </em>v. <em>Bank of America, NA</em>, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 792, 800\xe2\x80\x93801, and n.\xc2\xa011 (CA9 2003); <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital</em>, 140 F.\xc2\xa03d 1405, 1411\xe2\x80\x931413 (CA11 1998).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is this: (1) in 1969, <em>Sullivan</em>, as interpreted by <em>Jackson</em>, recognized that \xc2\xa71982 encompasses a retaliation action; (2) this Court has long interpreted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 alike; (3) in 1989, <em>Patterson</em>, without mention of retaliation, narrowed \xc2\xa71981 by excluding from its scope conduct, namely post-contract-formation conduct, where retaliation would most likely be found; but in 1991, Congress enacted legislation that superseded <em>Patterson </em>and<em> </em>explicitly defined the scope of \xc2\xa71981 to include post-contract-formation conduct; and (4) since 1991, the lower courts have uniformly interpreted \xc2\xa71981 as encompassing retaliation actions.  </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Sullivan</em>, as interpreted and relied upon by <em>Jackson</em>, as well as the long line of related cases where we construe \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 similarly, lead us to conclude that the view that \xc2\xa71981 encompasses retaliation claims is indeed well embedded in the law.  That being so, considerations of <em>stare decisis</em> strongly support our adherence to that view.  And those considerations impose a considerable burden upon those who would seek a different interpretation that would necessarily unsettle many Court precedents.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Welch</em> v. <em>Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/468/index.html">483 U. S. 468</a>, 494\xe2\x80\x93495 (1987) (plurality opinion) (describing importance of <em>stare decisis</em>); <em>Patterson</em>, 491 U. S., at 172 (considerations of <em>stare decisis</em> \xe2\x80\x9chave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 several arguments, taken separately or together, cannot justify a departure from what we have just described as the well-embedded interpretation of \xc2\xa71981.  First, CBOCS points to the plain text of \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x94a text that says that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]ll persons</em> . . . shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by <em>white citizens.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981(a) (emphasis added).  CBOCS adds that, insofar as Humphries complains of retaliation, he is complaining of a retaliatory action that the employer would have taken against him whether he was black or white, and there is no way to construe this text to cover that kind of deprivation.  Thus the text\xe2\x80\x99s language, CBOCS concludes, simply \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not provide for a cause of action based on retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 8.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with CBOCS that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an individual (black or white) who suffers retaliation because he has tried to help a different individual, suffering direct racial discrimination, secure his \xc2\xa71981 rights.  But that fact alone is not sufficient to carry the day.  After all, this Court has long held that the statutory text of \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s sister statute, \xc2\xa71982, provides protection from retaliation for reasons related to the<em> enforcement </em>of the express statutory right.  See <em>supra</em>, at 3.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Court has recently read another broadly worded civil rights statute, namely, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681 <em>et seq</em>., as including an antiretaliation remedy.  In 2005 in <em>Jackson</em>, the Court considered whether statutory language prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination [on the basis of sex] under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71681(a), encompassed claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination.  544 U. S., at 173\xe2\x80\x93174.  Despite the fact that Title IX does not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held in <em>Jackson</em> that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language encompassed such a claim, in part because: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cCongress enacted Title IX just three years after <em>Sullivan </em>was decided\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with <em>Sullivan;</em> and (3) Congress consequently \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expected its enactment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of Title IX \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to be interpreted in conformity with\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sullivan</em>.  <em>Jackson, supra</em>, at 176.  The Court in <em>Jackson</em> explicitly rejected the arguments the dissent advances here\xe2\x80\x94that <em>Sullivan</em> was merely a standing case, see <em>post</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Compare <em>Jackson</em>, 544 U. S., at 176, n.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was not so limited.  It plainly held that the white owner could maintain his <em>own</em> private cause of action under \xc2\xa71982 if he could show that he was \xe2\x80\x98punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)), with <em>id</em>., at 194 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, the linguistic argument that CBOCS makes was apparent at the time the Court decided <em>Sullivan</em>.  See 396 U. S., at 241 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (noting the construction of \xc2\xa71982 in <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html"></a><a href="/us/392/409/index.html">392 U. S. 409</a> was \xe2\x80\x9cin no way required by [the statute\xe2\x80\x99s] language,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one of the bases of Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in <em>Jones</em>\xe2\x80\x94and further contending that the Court in <em>Sullivan</em> had gone \xe2\x80\x9cyet beyond\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jones</em>).  And we believe it is too late in the day in effect to overturn the holding in that case (nor does CBOCS ask us to do so) on the basis of a linguistic argument that was apparent, and which the Court did not embrace at that time.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, CBOCS argues that Congress, in 1991 when it reenacted \xc2\xa71981 with amendments, intended the reenacted statute <em>not </em>to cover retaliation.  CBOCS rests this conclusion primarily upon the fact that Congress <em>did not </em>include an <em>explicit </em>antiretaliation provision or the word \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation\xe2\x80\x9d in the new statutory language\xe2\x80\x94although Congress has included explicit antiretaliation language in other civil rights statutes.  See, <em>e.g., </em> National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7158(a)(4); Fair Labor Standards Act  of 1938, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7215(a)(3); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a); Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(d); Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712203(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b); Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72615.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe, however, that the circumstances to which CBOCS points find a far more plausible explanation in the fact that, given <em>Sullivan </em>and the new statutory language nullifying <em>Patterson, </em>there was no need for Congress to include explicit language about retaliation.  After all, the 1991 amendments themselves make clear that Congress intended to supersede the result in <em>Patterson</em> and embrace pre-<em>Patterson</em> law.  And pre-<em>Patterson </em>law included <em>Sullivan</em>.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  Nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text or in the surrounding circumstances suggests any congressional effort to supersede <em>Sullivan </em>or the interpretation that courts have subsequently given that case.  To the contrary, the amendments\xe2\x80\x99 history indicates that Congress intended to restore that interpretation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x9340, at 92 (noting that \xc2\xa71981(b) in the \xe2\x80\x9ccontext of employment discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6 would include \xe2\x80\xa6 claims of \xe2\x80\xa6 retaliation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, CBOCS points out that \xc2\xa71981, if applied to employment-related retaliation actions, would overlap with Title VII.  It adds that Title VII requires that those who invoke its remedial powers satisfy certain procedural and administrative requirements that \xc2\xa71981 does not contain.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(1) (charge of discrimination must be brought before EEOC within 180 days of the discriminatory act); \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1) (suit must be filed within 90 days of obtaining an EEOC right-to-sue letter).  And CBOCS says that permitting a \xc2\xa71981 retaliation action would allow a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecific administrative and procedural mechanisms,\xe2\x80\x9d thereby undermining their effectiveness.  Brief for Petitioner 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument, however, proves too much.  Precisely the same kind of Title VII/\xc2\xa71981 \xe2\x80\x9coverlap\xe2\x80\x9d and potential circumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct discrimination.  Yet Congress explicitly created the overlap in respect to direct employment discrimination.  Nor is it obvious how we can interpret \xc2\xa71981 to avoid <em>employment-</em>related overlap without eviscerating \xc2\xa71981 in respect to <em>non-</em>employment contracts where no such overlap\nexists.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless, we have previously acknowledged a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary overlap\xe2\x80\x9d between Title VII and \xc2\xa71981.  <em>Patterson</em>, 491 U. S., at 181.  We have added that the \xe2\x80\x9cremedies available under Title VII and under \xc2\xa71981, although related, and although directed to most of the same ends, are separate, distinct, and independent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/454/index.html">421 U. S. 454</a>, 461 (1975).  We have pointed out that Title VII provides important administrative remedies and other benefits that \xc2\xa71981 lacks.  See <em>id.,</em> at 457\xe2\x80\x93458 (detailing the benefits of Title VII to those aggrieved by race-based employment discrimination).  And we have concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cTitle VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/36/index.html">415 U. S. 36</a>, 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (1974)<em>.</em>  In a word, we have previously held that the \xe2\x80\x9coverlap\xe2\x80\x9d reflects congressional design.  See <em>ibid</em>.  We have no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, CBOCS says it finds support for its position in two of our recent cases, <em>Burlington N. &amp; S. F. R. Co.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/53/index.html">548 U. S. 53</a> (2006), and <em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza, Inc.</em> v. <em>McDonald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/470/index.html">546 U. S. 470</a> (2006).  In <em>Burlington</em>, a Title VII case, we distinguished between discrimination that harms individuals because of \xe2\x80\x9cwho they are, <em>i.e</em>., their status,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, as women or as black persons, and discrimination that harms \xe2\x80\x9cindividuals based on what they do, <em>i.e</em>., their conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, whistle-blowing that leads to retaliation.  548 U. S., at 63.  CBOCS says that we should draw a similar distinction here and\nconclude that \xc2\xa71981 only encompasses status-based discrimination.  In <em>Burlington</em>, however,<em> </em>we used the status/conduct distinction to help explain why Congress might have wanted its explicit Title VII antiretaliation provision to sweep more broadly (<em>i.e</em>., to include conduct <em>outside</em> the workplace) than its substantive Title VII (status-based) antidiscrimination provision.  <em>Burlington</em> did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent argues that the distinction made in <em>Burlington</em> is meaningful here because it purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cunderscores the fact that status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored legislative treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 5.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a general ban on discrimination such as that contained in \xc2\xa71981 to cover retaliation claims, the dissent continues, would somehow render the separate antiretaliation provisions in other statutes \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But the Court in <em>Burlington</em> did not find that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision was redundant; it found that the provision had a broader reach than the statute\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provision.  And in any case, we have held that \xe2\x80\x9clegislative enactments in this area have long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alexander</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 47.  See <em>Great American Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>Novotny</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/366/index.html">442 U. S. 366</a>, 377 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ubstantive rights conferred in the 19th century [civil rights acts] were not withdrawn, <em>sub silentio</em>, by the subsequent passage of the modern statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the Court has accepted overlap between a number of civil rights statutes.  See <em>ibid</em>. (discussing interrelation of fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and \xc2\xa71982; between \xc2\xa71981 and Title VII).  See also <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (any overlap in reach between \xc2\xa71981 and Title VII, the statute at issue in <em>Burlington</em>, is by congressional design).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CBOCS highlights the second case, <em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza</em>, along with <em>Patterson</em>, and cites <em>Cort</em> v. <em>Ash</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/index.html">422 U. S. 66</a> (1975) and <em>Rodriguez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/522/index.html">480 U. S. 522</a> (1987) <em>(per curiam)</em>, to show that this Court now follows an approach to statutory interpretation that emphasizes text.  And that newer approach, CBOCS claims, should lead us to revisit the holding in <em>Sullivan, </em>an older case, where the Court placed less weight upon the textual language itself.  But even were we to posit for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake that changes in interpretive approach take place from time to time, we could not agree that the existence of such a change would justify reexamination of well-established prior law.  Principles of s<em>tare decisis, </em>after all, demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of interpretation change or stay the same.  Were that not so, those principles would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which the rule of law depends.  See, <em>e.g., John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939)<em>.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that considerations of stare decisis</em> strongly support our adherence to <em>Sullivan </em>and the long line of related cases where we interpret \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 similarly.  CBOCS\xe2\x80\x99 arguments do not convince us to the contrary.  We consequently hold that 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981 encompasses claims of retaliation.

Section 1981(a) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1981(a) thus guarantees \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll persons \xe2\x80\xa6 the same right \xe2\x80\xa6 to make and enforce contracts \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is difficult to see where one finds a cause of action for retaliation in this language.  On its face, \xc2\xa71981(a) is a straightforward ban on racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts.  Not surprisingly, that is how the Court has always construed it.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Domino\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza, Inc.</em> v. <em>McDonald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/470/index.html">546 U. S. 470</a>, 476 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 1981 offers relief when racial discrimination blocks the creation of a contractual relationship, as well as when racial discrimination impairs an existing contractual relationship\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/164/index.html">491 U. S. 164</a>, 171 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[Section] 1981 \xe2\x80\x98prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html"></a><a href="/us/427/160/index.html">427 U.

S. 454</a>, 459 (1975) (Section 1981 \xe2\x80\x9con its face relates primarily to racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent nonetheless contends that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he terms of section 1981 are significantly different, and broader, than a simple prohibition against discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15.  It is true that \xc2\xa71981(a), which was enacted shortly after the Civil War, does not use the modern statutory formulation prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that is the clear import of its terms.  Contrary to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention, nothing in \xc2\xa71981 evinces a \xe2\x80\x9cconcer[n] with protecting individuals \xe2\x80\x98based on what they do,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prevent[ing] injury to individuals based on who they are.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting <em>Burlington N.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0F.\xc2\xa0R. Co.</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/53/index.html">548 U. S. 53</a>, 63 (2006)).  Nor does \xc2\xa71981 \xe2\x80\x9caffirmatively guarante[e]\xe2\x80\x9d freestanding \xe2\x80\x9crights to engage in particular conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 16.  Rather, \xc2\xa71981 is an <em>equal-rights</em> provision.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Rachel</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/780/index.html">384 U. S. 780</a>, 791 (1966) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to protect a limited category of rights, specifically defined in terms of racial equality\xe2\x80\x9d).  The statute assumes that \xe2\x80\x9cwhite citizens\xe2\x80\x9d enjoy certain rights and requires that those rights be extended equally to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll persons,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of their race.  That is to say, it prohibits discrimination based on race.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Retaliation is not discrimination based on race.  When an individual is subjected to reprisal because he has complained about racial discrimination, the injury he suffers is not on account of his <em>race;</em> rather, it is the result of his <em>conduct</em>.  The Court recognized this commonsense distinction just two years ago in <em>Burlington </em>when it explained that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination provision \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, <em>i.e.</em>, their status,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas its \xe2\x80\x9cantiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do, <em>i.e.</em>, their conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  548 U. S., at 63.  This distinction is sound, and it reflects the fact that a claim of retaliation is both logically and factually distinct from a claim of discrimination\xe2\x80\x94logically because retaliation based on conduct and discrimination based on status are mutually exclusive categories, and factually because a claim of retaliation does not depend on proof that any status-based discrimination actually occurred.  Consider, for example, an employer who fires any employee who complains of race discrimination, regardless of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s race.  Such an employer is undoubtedly guilty of retaliation, but he has not discriminated on the basis of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s race.  Because the employer treats all employees\xe2\x80\x94black and white\xe2\x80\x94the same, he does not deny any employee \xe2\x80\x9cthe same right \xe2\x80\xa6 to make and enforce contracts \xe2\x80\xa6 as is enjoyed by white citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court apparently believes that the status/conduct distinction is not relevant here because this case, unlike <em>Burlington</em>, does not require us to determine whether \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x99s supposed prohibition on retaliation \xe2\x80\x9csweep[s] more broadly\xe2\x80\x9d than its antidiscrimination prohibition.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  That is nonsense.  Although, as the Court notes, we used the status/conduct distinction in <em>Burlington </em>to explain why Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision must sweep more broadly than its antidiscrimination provision in order to achieve its purpose, 548 U. S., at 63\xe2\x80\x9364, it does not follow that the distinction between status and conduct is irrelevant here.  To the contrary, <em>Burlington</em> underscores the fact that status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored legislative treatment.  That is why Congress, in Title VII and a host of other statutes, has enacted separate provisions prohibiting discrimination and retaliation.  See Brief for Petitioner 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing statutes); see also <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (same).  Construing a general ban on discrimination such as that contained in \xc2\xa71981 to cover retaliation would render these separate antiretaliation provisions superfluous, contrary to the normal rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, this is not the first time I have made these points.  Three Terms ago in <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Birmingham Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/167/index.html">544 U. S. 167</a> (2005), the Court held that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71681 <em>et seq.</em>, which prohibits recipients of federal education funding from discriminating \xe2\x80\x9con the basis of sex,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71681(a), affords an implied cause of action for retaliation against those who complain of sex discrimination.  In so doing, the Court disregarded the fundamental distinction between status-based discrimination and conduct-based retaliation, asserting that retaliation against those who complain of sex discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cis discrimination \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 174.  But as I explained in my dissenting opinion in <em>Jackson</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sex-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not based on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s sex, much less the complainer\xe2\x80\x99s sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 188.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise here, the race-based topic of the complaint cannot overcome the fact that the retaliation is not based on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s race.  To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cprotection from retaliation is separate from direct protection of the primary right [against discrimination] and serves as a prophylactic measure to guard the primary right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 189; see also <em>Burlington</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 63 (explaining that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cantidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas its \xe2\x80\x9cantiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic guarantees\xe2\x80\x9d).<em> </em>In other words, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o describe retaliation as discrimination on the basis of [race] is to conflate the enforcement mechanism with the right itself, something for which the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text provides no warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 189 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, the Court does not repeat <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s textual analysis in this case, perhaps because no amount of repetition could make it any more plausible today than it was three years ago.  Instead, the Court acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute\xe2\x80\x99s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an individual (black or white) who suffers retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  The Court concludes, however, that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s failure expressly to provide a cause of action for retaliation \xe2\x80\x9cis not sufficient to carry the day,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, despite our usual rule that \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative evidence of congressional intent must be provided for an implied remedy \xe2\x80\xa6 for without such intent the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 293, n. 8 (2001) (internal quotation marks and emphasis deleted); see also <em>id</em>., at 286\xe2\x80\x93287 (emphasizing that, absent evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to create a cause of action, the \xe2\x80\x9ccause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1981\xe2\x80\x99s silence regarding retaliation is not dispositive, the Court says, because \xe2\x80\x9cit is too late in the day\xe2\x80\x9d to resort to \xe2\x80\x9ca linguistic argument\xe2\x80\x9d that was supposedly rejected in <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/396/229/index.html">396 U. S. 229</a> (1969).  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  As I explain below, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Sullivan </em>is entirely misplaced.  But it also bears emphasis that the Court does not even purport to identify any basis in the statutory text for the \xe2\x80\x9cwell-embedded interpretation of \xc2\xa71981,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 8\xe2\x80\x939, it adopts for the first time today.  Unlike the Court, I find the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text dispositive.  Because \xc2\xa71981 by its terms prohibits only discrimination based on race, and because retaliation is not discrimination based on race, \xc2\xa71981 does not provide an implied cause of action for retaliation.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unable to justify its holding as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court today retreats behind the figleaf of ersatz <em>stare decisis</em>.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of <em>stare decisis</em> appears to rest on three considerations: (1) <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s purported recognition of a cause of action for retaliation under \xc2\xa71982; (2) <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s (re)interpretation of <em>Sullivan;</em> and (3) the Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view that \xc2\xa71981 provides a cause of action for retaliation.  None of these considerations, separately or together, justifies implying a cause of action that Congress did not include in the statute.  And none can conceal the irony in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s novel use of <em>stare decisis</em> to decide a question of first impression.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn first to <em>Sullivan</em>, as it bears most of the weight in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.  As I explained in my dissent in <em>Jackson</em>, <em>Sullivan</em> did not \xe2\x80\x9chol[d] that a general prohibition against discrimination permitted a claim of retaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cthat a white lessor had standing to assert the right of a black lessee to be free from racial discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 194.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make out his third-party claim on behalf of the black lessee, the white lessor would necessarily be required to demonstrate that the defendant had discriminated against the black lessee on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Here, by contrast, respondent \xe2\x80\x9cneed not show that the [race] discrimination forming the basis of his complaints actually occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, as it did in <em>Jackson</em>, the Court \xe2\x80\x9ccreates an entirely new cause of action for a secondary rights holder, beyond the claim of the original rights holder, and well beyond <em>Sullivan</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 194\xe2\x80\x93195.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having reexamined <em>Sullivan</em>, I remain convinced that it was a third-party standing case.  Sullivan did not argue that his expulsion from the corporation\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to approve the assignment\xe2\x80\x94violated \xc2\xa71982.  Instead, he argued that his expulsion was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to public policy\xe2\x80\x9d because it was the \xe2\x80\x9cdirect result of his having dealt with Freeman, as the statute requires, on a non-discriminatory basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1969, No. 33, p.\xc2\xa032.  Sullivan further contended not that his own rights under \xc2\xa71982 had been violated, but that he \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] standing to rely on the rights of the Negro, Freeman,\xe2\x80\x9d since he was best situated to vindicate those rights.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 33; see also Pet. for Cert. in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Little Hunting Park, Inc.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1969, No. 33, p.\xc2\xa017, n.\xc2\xa013 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the statute declares the rights of Negroes not to be discriminated against, Sullivan, a Caucasian, has standing to rely on the invasion of the rights of others, since he is the only effective adversary capable of vindicating them in litigation arising from his expulsion\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Similarly, the United States, appearing as <em>amicus curiae</em> in support of Sullivan, argued that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe private action involved in refusing to honor the assignment was itself illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crelief should be available to all persons injured by it, or as a consequence of their efforts to resist it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1969, No. 33, p.\xc2\xa034.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, both Sullivan and the United States argued that Sullivan had standing to seek relief for injuries he suffered as a result of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s violation of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s rights\xe2\x80\x94not that Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s own rights under \xc2\xa71982 were violated.  And that is the best interpretation of what the Court subsequently held.  Tracking the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, the Court first concluded that that the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crefus[al] to approve the assignment of the membership share \xe2\x80\xa6 was clearly an interference with Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s right to \xe2\x80\x98lease\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71982.  396 U. S., at 237.  Only then did it conclude\xe2\x80\x94based on <em>Barrows</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/index.html">346 U. S. 249</a> (1953), a third-party standing case in which another white litigant was permitted to \xe2\x80\x9crely on the invasion of the rights of others,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 255\xe2\x80\x94that Sullivan \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] standing to maintain this action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sullivan</em>, 396 U. S., at 237.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Nor is there any suggestion that Sullivan would have had \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d absent the violation of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, <em>Sullivan</em> is not a model of clarity, and Justice Harlan, writing in dissent, was correct to criticize the \xe2\x80\x9cundiscriminating manner\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Court dealt with Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 251.  Sullivan had sought relief both for the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to approve the assignment and for his expulsion.  <em>Id</em>., at 253.  But in stating that Sullivan had standing to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cthis action,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 237,<em> </em>the Court did not specify what relief Sullivan was entitled to pursue on remand.  Lamenting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to provide any guidance as to the legal standards that should govern Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s right to recovery on remand,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 252 (dissenting opinion), Justice Harlan provided an instructive summary of the ambiguities in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOne can imagine a variety of standards, each based on different legal conclusions as to the \xe2\x80\x98rights\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98duties\xe2\x80\x99 created by \xc2\xa71982, and each having very different remedial consequences.  For example, does \xc2\xa71982 give Sullivan a right to relief only for injuries resulting from Little Hunting Park\xe2\x80\x99s interference with <em>his</em> statutory duty to Freeman under \xc2\xa71982?  If so, what is Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s duty to Freeman under \xc2\xa71982?  Unless \xc2\xa71982 is read to impose a duty on Sullivan to <em>protest</em> Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion, he would be entitled to reinstatement under this standard only if the Board had expelled him for the simple act of assigning his share to Freeman.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAs an alternative, Sullivan might be thought to be entitled to relief from those injuries that flowed from the Board\xe2\x80\x99s violation of <em>its</em> \xe2\x80\x98duty\xe2\x80\x99 to Freeman under \xc2\xa71982.  Such a standard might suggest that Sullivan is entitled to damages that resulted from Little Hunting Park\xe2\x80\x99s initial refusal to accept the assignment to Freeman but again not to reinstatement.  Or does the Court think that \xc2\xa71982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \xe2\x80\x98legitimate\xe2\x80\x99 protest aimed at convincing the Board to accept Freeman?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 254\xe2\x80\x93255.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is noteworthy that of the three possible standards Justice Harlan outlined, the first two clearly depend on a showing that Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71982 rights were violated.  Only the third\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOr does the Court think that \xc2\xa71982 gives Sullivan a right to relief from injuries that result from his \xe2\x80\x98legitimate\xe2\x80\x99 protest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94resembles a traditional retaliation claim and, in context, even it is probably best read to presuppose that Sullivan was protesting an actual violation of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  <em>Id.,</em> at 255.  Which, if any, of these standards the Court had in mind is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess.  It did not say.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I thus adhere to my view that <em>Sullivan</em> is best read as a third-party standing case.  That is how the parties argued the case, and that is the most natural reading of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  But even if <em>Sullivan</em> could fairly be read as having inferred a freestanding cause of action for retaliation\xe2\x80\x94which I doubt it can, at least not without superimposing an anachronistic outlook on a Court that was not as familiar with retaliation claims as we are today\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s one-paragraph discussion of the issue was, at best, both cursory and ambiguous.  This is hardly the stuff of which <em>stare decisis</em> is made.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Steadfastly refusing to acknowledge any ambiguity, the Court asserts that it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot surprising that following <em>Sullivan</em>, federal appeals courts concluded, on the basis of <em>Sullivan</em> or its reasoning, that \xc2\xa71981 encompassed retaliation claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 5.  But given <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d and its reliance on a third-party standing case, what is unsurprising is that each of the cases the Court cites either characterized the issue as one of standing, <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Lear-Siegler, Inc.</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa02d 1266, 1270 (CA6 1977) (characterizing the issue as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not the white plaintiff in this action has standing to sue his former employer under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71981 for discharging him in alleged retaliation for plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s protesting the alleged discriminatory firing of a black co-worker\xe2\x80\x9d), or recognized that it was taking a step beyond <em>Sullivan</em> in inferring a cause of action for retaliation, <em>Choudhury </em>v. <em>Polytechnic Inst. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, 735 F.\xc2\xa02d 38, 42 (CA2 1984) (stating that the Second Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] never decided whether \xc2\xa71981 creates a cause of action for retaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d even though it had previously held, based on <em>Sullivan</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a white person who claimed to have suffered reprisals as a result of his efforts to vindicate the rights of non-whites had standing to sue under \xc2\xa71981\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Continental Oil Co.</em>, 678 F.\xc2\xa02d 593, 598, n.\xc2\xa07 (CA5 1982) (recognizing that <em>Sullivan</em> and a previous Fifth Circuit decision relying on <em>Sullivan</em> were \xe2\x80\x9cessentially standing cases holding that white people can assert civil rights claims when they are harmed by someone\xe2\x80\x99s discrimination against blacks,\xe2\x80\x9d which is distinct from holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca particular type of conduct\xe2\x80\x94retaliation for the filing of a \xc2\xa71981 law suit\xe2\x80\x94is actionable in the first place\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even if <em>Sullivan</em> had squarely and unambiguously held that \xc2\xa71982 provides an implied cause of action for retaliation, it would have been wrong to do so because \xc2\xa71982, like \xc2\xa71981, prohibits only discrimination based on race, and retaliation is not discrimination based on race.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The question, then, would be whether to extend <em>Sullivan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous interpretation of \xc2\xa71982 to \xc2\xa71981.  The Court treats this as a foregone conclusion because \xe2\x80\x9cour precedents have long construed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981 and 1982 similarly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 4.  But erroneous precedents need not be extended to their logical end, even when dealing with related provisions that normally would be interpreted in lockstep.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Otherwise, <em>stare decisis</em>, designed to be a principle of stability and repose, would become a vehicle of change whereby an error in one area metastasizes into others, thereby distorting the law.  Two wrongs do not make a right, and an aesthetic preference for symmetry should not prevent us from recognizing the true meaning of an Act of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s remaining reasons for invoking <em>stare decisis</em> require little discussion.  First, the Court relies on the fact that <em>Jackson</em> interpreted <em>Sullivan</em> as having recognized a cause of action for retaliation under \xc2\xa71982.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3, 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  That is true but irrelevant.  It was only through loose language and creative use of brackets that <em>Jackson </em>was able to assert that <em>Sullivan</em> \xe2\x80\x9cupheld Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71982 for \xe2\x80\x98[retaliation] for the advocacy of [the black person\xe2\x80\x99s] cause.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 176 (quoting <em>Sullivan</em>, 396 U. S., at 237; brackets in original).  Of course, <em>Sullivan</em> did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d did not say anything about a \xe2\x80\x9ccause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d and did not state that Sullivan had rights under \xc2\xa71982.  It most certainly did not \xe2\x80\x9cinterpre[t] a general prohibition on racial discrimination to cover retaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jackson</em>,<em> </em>544 U. S.,<em> </em>at 176.  <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that <em>Sullivan</em> \xe2\x80\x9cplainly held that the white owner could maintain his <em>own</em> private cause of action under \xc2\xa71982,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 176, n. 1, misses the point entirely.  While <em>Sullivan</em> held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe white owner\xe2\x80\x9d had standing to maintain his own <em>suit</em>, it said nothing to suggest that he could sue to vindicate his own <em>right</em> to be free from retaliation under \xc2\xa71982.  Rather, as I have explained, Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d was derivative of the violation of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s rights.  In short, <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of <em>Sullivan</em> was erroneous, and I am aware of no principle of <em>stare decisis </em>that requires us to give decisive weight to a precedent\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous characterization of another precedent\xe2\x80\x94particularly where, as here, the cases involved different statutes, neither of which was the statute at issue in the case at bar.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Court appears to give weight to the fact that, since Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa7101, 105 Stat. 1071, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lower courts have uniformly interpreted \xc2\xa71981 as encompassing retaliation actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  This rationale fares no better than the others. The Court has never suggested that rejection of a view uniformly held by the courts of appeals violates some principle of <em>stare decisis</em>.  To the contrary, we have not hesitated to take a different view if convinced the lower courts were wrong.  Indeed, it has become something of a dissenter\xe2\x80\x99s tactic to point out that the Court has decided a question differently than every court of appeals to have considered it.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/93/index.html">540 U. S. 93</a>, 278, n.\xc2\xa011 (2003) (Thomas,<font caps="1"> J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.</em> v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/598/index.html">532 U. S. 598</a>, 643 (2001) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>Sandoval</em>, 532 U. S., at 294 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/227/index.html">526 U. S. 227</a>, 254 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); <em>McNally</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/350/index.html">483 U. S. 350</a>, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The Court does not explain what makes this particular line of lower court authority any more sacrosanct than those we have rejected in the past.</font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, lower court decisions may be persuasive, and when the Court rejects the unanimous position of the courts of appeals, it is fair to point out that fact.  But the point has traction only to the extent it tends to show that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is flawed on the merits, as demonstrated by the number of judges who have reached the opposite conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Buckhannon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 643\xe2\x80\x93644 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen this Court rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits, respect for our colleagues demands a cogent explanation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Unlike decisions of this Court, decisions of the courts of appeals, even when unanimous, do not carry <em>stare decisis</em> weight, nor do they relieve us of our obligation independently to decide the merits of the question presented.  That is why, when we have affirmed a view unanimously held by the courts of appeals, we have done so (at least until today) not because we gave precedential weight to the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, but because we agreed with their resolution of the question on the merits.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/524/index.html">545 U. S. 524</a>, 531 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9cVirtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that such a pleading \xe2\x80\xa6 is in substance a successive habeas petition \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  We think those holdings are correct\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow</em> v. <em>Gilbertson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/350/index.html">501 U. S. 350</a>, 362 (1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cThus, we agree with every Court of Appeals that has been called upon to apply a federal statute of limitations to a \xc2\xa710(b) claim\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Jackson</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question before us is only whether [\xc2\xa71981] prohibits retaliation, not whether prohibiting it is good policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U. S., at 195 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy crafting its own additional enforcement mechanism, the majority returns this Court to the days in which it created remedies out of whole cloth to effectuate its vision of congressional purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That the Court does so under the guise of <em>stare decisis</em> does not make its decision any more justifiable.  Because the text of \xc2\xa71981 provides no basis for implying a private right of action for retaliation, and because no decision of this Court holds to the contrary, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The United States, appearing as <em>amicus curiae</em> in support of respondent, contends that \xc2\xa71981 prohibits not only racial discrimination, but also any other kind of \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cimpair[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the rights guaranteed by \xc2\xa71981(a).  Brief for United States 17.  In support of this argument, the United States points to \xc2\xa71981(c), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the argument goes, retaliation is prohibited because it is discrimination (differential treatment for those who complain) and it impairs the right granted in \xc2\xa71981(a) to be free from racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts (by penalizing assertion of that right).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I commend the United States for at least attempting to ground its position in the statutory text, its argument is unconvincing.  Section 1981(c) simply codifies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Runyon</em> v. <em>McCrary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/160/index.html"></a><a href="/us/427/160/index.html">427 U. S. 160</a> (1976), that \xc2\xa71981 applies to private, as well as governmental, discrimination.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71981(c) indicates that Congress otherwise intended to expand the scope of \xc2\xa71981.  To the contrary, \xc2\xa71981(c) refers to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rights protected by this section,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the rights enumerated in \xc2\xa71981(a) to make and enforce contracts on the same terms as white citizens.  Moreover, the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71981(c) does not refer to \xe2\x80\x9call discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d as the United States would have it.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16, n.\xc2\xa04.  Rather, it refers back to the type of discrimination prohibited by \xc2\xa71981(a), <em>i.e.</em>, discrimination based on race.  Thus, \xc2\xa71981 is violated only when racial discrimination impairs the right to make and enforce contracts.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course, if an employer had a <em>different</em> retaliation policy for blacks and whites\xe2\x80\x94firing black employees who complain of race discrimination but not firing similarly situated white employees\xe2\x80\x94a black employee who was fired for complaining of race discrimination would have a promising \xc2\xa71981 claim.  But his claim would not sound in retaliation; rather, it would be a straightforward claim of racial discrimination.  In his briefs before this Court, respondent attempts to shoehorn his claim into this category, asserting that petitioner \xe2\x80\x9cretaliated against [him] because he was a black worker who exercised his right\xe2\x80\x9d to lodge a grievance under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s open-door policy.  Brief for Respondent 27; see also <em>id</em>., at 33 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ection 1981 forbids an employer from having one dismissal policy for blacks who complain about race discrimination, and another for whites who complain about such discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  But respondent cites no record evidence to support his assertion that petitioner treated him differently than it would have treated a similarly situated white complainant.  And while the Court of Appeals found that respondent had established a prima facie<em> </em>case of retaliation, 474 F.\xc2\xa03d 387, 406\xe2\x80\x93407 (CA7 2007), it did not identify any evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the alleged retaliation was race based.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals held that respondent had \xe2\x80\x9cwaived \xe2\x80\xa6 his discrimination claim by devoting only a skeletal argument [to it] in response to [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] motion for summary judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 407.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In contrast to his argument based on \xc2\xa71982, which he consistently tied to the violation of Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s rights, Sullivan also argued that his <em>own</em> First Amendment rights were violated:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSince Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s expulsion was in retaliation for his having obeyed the dictate of the law the expulsion was against public policy, and he should be reinstated.  For the law to sanction punishment of a person such as Sullivan for refusing to discriminate against Negroes would be to render nugatory <em>the rights guaranteed</em> <em>to Negroes</em> by 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71981, 1982 \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Furthermore, by giving sanction to Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s expulsion, the state court deprived Sullivan of <em>his</em> <em>rights</em>, guaranteed by the First Amendment to criticize the conduct of the association\xe2\x80\x99s directors.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1969, No. 33, p. 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority claims that <em>Sullivan </em>\xe2\x80\x9cdid not embrace\xe2\x80\x9d this \xe2\x80\x9clinguistic argument.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  That is because the argument was not before the Court.  The corporation did not argue that \xc2\xa71982\xe2\x80\x99s text could not reasonably be construed to create a cause of action for retaliation; nor did Justice Harlan in dissent.  No one made this argument because that was not how the issue was framed, either by Sullivan or by the Court.  The majority suggests that the argument was \xe2\x80\x9capparent at the time the Court decided <em>Sullivan</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But the only evidence it cites is Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s observation that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/409/index.html">392 U.

I fail to see how that observation\xe2\x80\x94or Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s further observation that the Court in <em>Sullivan </em>had gone \xe2\x80\x9cyet beyond <em>Jones</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.\xe2\x80\x94shows that the Court considered and rejected the entirely different argument that \xc2\xa71982\xe2\x80\x99s text does not provide a cause of action for retaliation.  </p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For example, we have refused to extend the holding of <em>J.\xc2\xa0I.

The Supreme Court requires us to proceed otherwise.  <em>Borak</em> dealt with \xc2\xa714(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778n(a).  It was as freewheeling in \xe2\x80\x98interpreting\xe2\x80\x99 that law as <em>Sullivan</em> was with \xc2\xa71982.  Yet the Court has held that the change of interpretive method announced in <em>Cort</em> applies to all other sections of the Securities Exchange Act.  See <em>Piper</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/1/index.html">430 U. S. 1</a> (1977) (\xc2\xa714(e)); <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co.</em> <em>v.
