Argued January 8, 2002-Decided March 19,2002</p><p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that a "charge" of employment discrimination be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission "within [a specified number of] days after the alleged unlawful ... practice occurred," \xc2\xa7 706(e)(1), and that the charge "be in writing under oath or affirmation," \xc2\xa7 706(b). An EEOC regulation permits an otherwise timely filer to verify a charge after the time for filing has expired. Mter respondent Lynchburg College denied academic tenure to petitioner Edelman, he faxed a letter to the EEOC in November 1997, claiming that the College had subjected him to genderbased, national origin, and religious discrimination. Edelman made no oath or affirmation. The EEOC advised him to file a charge within the applicable 300-day time limit and sent him a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination, which he returned 313 days after he was denied tenure. Edelman subsequently sued in a Virginia state court on various state-law claims, but later added a Title VII cause of action. The College then removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss, claiming that Edelman\'s failure to file the verified Form 5 with the EEOC within the applicable filing period was a bar to subject-matter jurisdiction. Edelman replied that his November 1997 letter was a timely filed charge and that under the EEOC regulation, the Form 5 verification related back to the letter. The District Court dismissed the Title VII complaint, finding that the letter was not a "charge" under Title VII because neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that Title VII\'s plain language foreclosed the relationback regulation. The court reasoned that, because a charge requires verification and must be filed within the limitations period, it follows that a charge must be verified within that period.</p><p><i>Held: </i>The EEOC\'s relation-back regulation is an unassailable interpretation of \xc2\xa7 706.

The time limitation is meant to encourage a potential charging party to raise a discrimination claim before it gets stale, while the verification requirement is intended to protect employers from the disruption and expense of responding to a claim unless a complainant is serious enough and sure enough to support it by oath subject to liability for perjury.

App. 52. Edelman made no oath or affirmation.</p><p>On November 26,1997, Edelman\'s lawyer wrote to the field office requesting an interview with an EEOC investigator and stating his "understanding that delay occasioned by the interview will not compromise the filing date, which will remain as November 14, 1997." <i>Id., </i>at 54. An EEOC employee replied to Edelman and advised him to arrange an interview with a member of the field office. Without referring to the lawyer\'s letter, the employee reminded Edelman that "a charge of discrimination must be filed within the time limits imposed by law." <i>Id., </i>at 57. In Edelman\'s case, the filing period was 300 days after the alleged discriminatory practice.1</p><p>After the interview, the EEOC sent Edelman a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination for him to review and verify by</p><p>1 A Title VII complainant generally has 180 days from the time of the alleged unlawful employment practice to file with the EEOC, 42 U.

On April 15, 1998, 313 days after the June 6, 1997, denial of tenure, the EEOC received the verified Form 5, which it forwarded to the College for response. After completing an investigation, the EEOC issued Edelman a notice of right to sue.</p><p>Edelman first sued in a Virginia state court on various state-law claims, but later added a cause of action under Title VII, 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-2(a)(1). The College then removed the case to Federal District Court and moved to dismiss, claiming that Edelman\'s failure to file the verified Form 5 with the EEOC within the applicable filing period was a bar to subject-matter jurisdiction. Edelman replied that his November 1997 letter was a timely filed charge and that under an EEOC regulation, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1601.12(b) (1997),2 the verification on the Form 5 related back to the letter.</p><p>The District Court found, however, that the November letter was not a "charge" within the meaning of Title VII because neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one, App. to Pet. for Cert. 22-24, with the consequence that there was no timely filing to which the verification on Form 5 could relate back. After finding no ground for equitable tolling of the filing requirements, the District Court dismissed the Title VII complaint and remanded the state-law claims. <i>Id., </i>at 24-25.</p><p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/228/503/">228 F.3d 503</a>, 512 <i>(CA4 </i>2000). The majority held that the plain language of the statute foreclosed the EEOC regulation</p><p>2 The regulation provides in relevant part that "a charge is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making the charge a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describe generally the action or practices complained of. A charge may be amended to cure technical defects or omissions, including failure to verify the charge, or to clarify and amplify allegations made therein. Such amendments and amendments alleging additional acts which constitute unlawful employment practices related to or growing out of the subject matter of the original charge will relate back to the date the charge was first received."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="111">111</a></p><p>allowing a later oath to relate back to an earlier charge. The majority reasoned that the verification and filing provisions in \xc2\xa7 706 of Title VII 3 were interdependent in defining "charge": "Because a charge requires verification ... , and because a charge must be filed within the limitations period, ... it follows that a charge must be verified within the limitations period." <i>Id., </i>at 508.</p><p>Judge Luttig concurred only in the judgment. <i>Id., </i>at 512513. He said that although the majority probably had "the better interpretation" of the statute, <i>id., </i>at 513, its reading of the filing and verification requirements as one was not compelled by the language, and the court was "bound to give deference" to the EEOC\'s construction, <i>ibid. </i>He nonetheless joined in the judgment for the District Court\'s reasons.</p><p>Because of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,4 we granted certiorari, 533 U.

Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Commission requires." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b). As to filing, \xc2\xa7 706(e)(I) provides that "[a] charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred and notice of the charge ... shall be served upon the person against whom such charge is made within ten days thereafter, except that in a case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice ... , such charge shall be filed ... within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." \xc2\xa72000e-5(e)(I).</p><p>4 Compare, <i>e. g., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/228/503/">228 F.3d 503</a>, 509 <i>(CA4 </i>2000) (case below); <i>Shempert </i>v.</p><p>Harwick Chemical Corp., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/151/793/">151 F.3d 793</a>, 796-797 <i>(CA8 </i>1998), with Philbin v.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5, governs the filing of charges of discrimination with the EEOC. Section 706(b) requires "[c]harges" to "be in writing under oath or affirmation ... contain[ing] such information and ... in such form as the Commission requires." \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b). Section 706(e)(1) provides that "[a] charge ... shall be filed within one hundred and eighty [or in some cases, three hundred] days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(e)(1).</p><p>Neither provision defines "charge," which is likewise undefined elsewhere in the statute.

Neither provision incorporates the other so as to give a definition by necessary implication.</p><p>The assumption of the Court of Appeals that the two provisions must be read as one, with "charge" defined as "under oath or affirmation," was thus a structural and logical leap.

S. 822</a>, 828 (1984). Although reading the two provisions together would not be facially inconsistent, doing that would ignore the two quite different objectives of the timing and verification requirements, which stand in the way of reading "charge" to subsume them both by definition.

There is accordingly nothing plain in reading "charge" to require an oath by definition. Questionable would be the better word.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The statute is thus open to interpretation and the regulation addresses a legitimate question. Before we touch on the merits of the EEOC\'s position, however, two threshold matters about the status of the regulation can be given short shrift. The first is whether the agency\'s rulemaking exceeded its authority to adopt "suitable procedural regulations," 42 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-12(a), and instead addressed a substantive issue over which the EEOC has no rulemaking power, see <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Arabian American Oil Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/244/case.html">499 U. S. 244</a>, 257 (1991); <i>General Elec. Co. </i>v. <i>Gilbert, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/case.html">429 U. S. 125</a>, 141 (1976). Although the College argues that the EEOC\'s regulation "alter[s] a substantive requirement included by Congress in the statute," Brief for Respondent 32-33, this is really nothing more than a recast of the plain language argument; the College is merely restating the position we</p><p>5 See <i>Delaware State College </i>v. <i>Ricks, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/250/case.html">449 U. S. 250</a>, 256-257 (1980) ("Limitations periods, while guaranteeing the protection of the civil rights laws to those who promptly assert their rights, also protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past").</p><p>6 See <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Shell Oil Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/54/case.html">466 U. S. 54</a>, 76, n. 32 (1984) ("The function of an oath is to impress upon its taker an awareness of his duty to tell the truth").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="114">114</a></p><p>just rejected, that Congress defined "charge" as a verified accusation.</p><p>The other issue insignificant in this case, however prominent it is in much of the litigation that goes on over agency rulemaking, is the degree of deference owed to the regulation by reviewing courts. We agree with the Government as <i>amicus </i>that deference under <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843-844 (1984), does not necessarily require an agency\'s exercise of express notice-and-comment rulemaking power,7 see Brief for United States et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>19, n. 11; we so observed in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mead Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/case.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 230231 (2001) ("[W]e have sometimes found reasons for <i>Chevron </i>deference even when no such administrative formality was required and none was afforded"). But there is no need to resolve any question of deference here. We find the EEOC rule not only a reasonable one, but the position we would adopt even if there were no formal rule and we were interpreting the statute from scratch. Because we so clearly agree with the EEOC, there is no occasion to defer and no point in asking what kind of deference, or how much.8</p><p>7Title VII does not require the EEOC to utilize notice-and-comment procedures.

S. C. \xc2\xa72000e12(a) (1994 ed.). And the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.

See <i>Commercial Office Products, </i>486 U. S., at 125 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The agency might, for example, have decided that the time to test the complainant\'s seriousness is before the agency expends any effort on the case, and so have required a verified complaint prior to interview. JUSTICE O\'CONNOR suggests, see <i>post, </i>at 122 (opinion concurring in judgment), that recognizing this implies that a sphere of deference is appropriate, and so resolves the <i>Chevron </i>question. But not all deference is deference under <i>Chevron, </i>see <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mead Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/case.html">533 U.

As we said before, the verification provision is meant to provide some degree of insurance against catchpenny claims of disgruntled, but not necessarily aggrieved, employees. In requiring the oath or affirmation, however, Congress presumably did not mean to affect the nature of Title VII as "a remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process." <i>EEOC </i>v. <i>Commercial Office Products Co., 486 </i>U.

Construing \xc2\xa7 706 to permit the relation back of an oath omitted from an original filing ensures that the lay complainant, who may not know enough to verify on filing, will not risk forfeiting his rights inadvertently. At the same time, the EEOC looks out for the employer\'s interest by refusing to call for any response to an otherwise sufficient complaint until the verification has been supplied.9</p><p>We would be hard pressed to take issue with the EEOC\'s position after deciding <i>Becker </i>v. <i>Montgomery, </i>532 U.

Brief for Respondent 20-25, 37. In 1972, during the floor debate over the Senate version (S. 2515) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Senator Allen noted that the committee amendments omitted the requirement that a charge be made under oath, and proposed an amendment to define a charge to "\'mean an accusation of discrimination supported by oath or affirmation.\'\'\' 118 Congo Rec. 4815 (1972). The Senator expressed his view that the amendment preserved what he believed to be an existing requirement under the 1964 Act that "charges are to be filed and made under oath in writing." <i>Ibid. </i>This understanding was neither confirmed nor denied, but Senator Williams, the bill\'s floor manager, suggested that rather than the "one coverall, blanket" definition proposed by Senator Allen, the oath requirement could be included at the beginning of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="118">118</a></p><p>debates over the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the text of the EEOC procedural regulations, including the predecessor of \xc2\xa7 1601.12(b), was placed in the Congressional Record. 118 Congo Rec. 718 (1972).

I do not agree that the EEOC has adopted the most natural interpretation of Title VII\'s provisions regarding the filing with the EEOC of charges of discrimination. See 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5 (1994 ed.). But, because the statute is at least somewhat ambiguous, I would defer to the agency\'s interpretation. See <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A.

I think the regulation, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1601.12(b) (1997), should be sustained on this alternative basis.</p><p>Title VII requires "charges" of discrimination to "be in writing under oath or affirmation." 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(b). It also requires "charge[s]" to "be filed within one hundred and eighty [or in some circumstances three hundred] days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." \xc2\xa7 2000e-5(e)(1). The most natural reading of these provisions is that the first is intended to be definitional, defining a "charge" as an allegation of discrimination made in writing under oath or affirmation. The second then specifies the time period in which such a verified charge must be filed. That Congress intended the provisions to be read together in this way is suggested by the fact that the two provisions are found in subsections of the same section of the statute. See <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Michigan Dept. of Treasury, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/803/case.html">489 U. S. 803</a>, 809 (1989) ("It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="121">121</a></p><p>with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme"). Surprisingly, however, the Court holds that the best reading is precisely the opposite-it says it "clearly agree[s] with the EEOC" that charges do not need to be verified within the specified time period. See <i>ante, </i>at 114.</p><p>Despite the fact that I think the best reading of the statute is that a charge must be made under oath or affirmation within the specified time, this is not the only possible reading of the statute. The definition section of the statute, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e, which expressly defines a number of terms, does not define the word "charge" to mean an allegation made under oath or affirmation. In fact, the definition section does not define the word "charge" at all. And the provision stating that "charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation" is not framed as a definition-it does not say, for example, that a charge <i>is </i>an allegation made in writing under oath or affirmation. Because the statute does not explicitly define "charge" to incorporate verification but only suggests it, the requirement that charges be verified and the requirement that charges be filed within the specified time could be read as independent requirements that do not need to be satisfied simultaneously. Congress, therefore, cannot be said to have <i>"unambiguously </i>expressed [its] intent" that the charge must be under oath or affirmation when filed. <i>Chevron, </i>467 U. S., at 843 (emphasis added). Given this ambiguity, under our decision in <i>Chevron, </i>"the question ... [becomes] whether the agency\'s [position] is based on a permissible construction of the statute," <i>ibid., </i>or, in other words, whether the agency\'s position is "reasonable," <i>id., </i>at 845. If so, then we must give it "controlling weight," <i>id., </i>at 844.</p><p>I find the regulation to be reasonable for some of the same reasons that the Court finds it to be the best interpretation of the statute. As the Court notes, Title VII is "\'a remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 115 (quoting <i>Com-</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="122">122</a></p><p><i>mercial Office Products Co., supra, </i>at 124). Permitting relation back of an oath omitted from an original filing is reasonable because it helps ensure that lay complainants will not inadvertently forfeit their rights. The regulation is also consistent, as the Court explains, with the common-law practice of allowing later verifications to relate back. See <i>ante, </i>at 116-117. For these reasons, I think the regulation is reasonable and should be sustained.</p><p>The Court reserved the question of whether the EEOC\'s regulation is entitled to <i>Chevron </i>deference. See <i>ante, </i>at 114. I doubt that it is possible to reserve this question while simultaneously maintaining, as the Court does, see <i>ante, </i>at 114-115, n. 8, that the agency is free to change its interpretation. To say that the matter is ambiguous enough to permit agency choice and to suggest that the Court would countenance a different choice is to say that the Court would (because it must) defer to a reasonable agency choice. Indeed, the concurring opinion that the Court cites for the proposition that the agency could change its position was premised on the idea that the agency was entitled to deference. See <i>Commercial Office Products Co., supra, </i>at 125126 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p><p>I think the EEOC\'s regulation is entitled to <i>Chevron </i>deference. We have, of course, previously held that because the EEOC was not given rulemaking authority to interpret the <i>substantive </i>provisions of Title VII, its substantive regulations do not receive <i>Chevron </i>deference, but instead only receive consideration according to the standards established in <i>Skidmore </i>v. <i>Swift </i>&amp; <i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/134/case.html">323 U.

The EEOC has, however, been given "authority from time to time to issue ... suitable <i>procedural </i>regulations to carry out the provisions of" Title VII, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2000e-12(a) (emphasis added). The regulation at issue here, which permits relation back of amendments to charges filed with the EEOC, is clearly such a procedural regulation. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15 (establishing rules for amendments to pleadings and relation back as part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Thus, as the Court recognizes, see <i>ante, </i>at 113-114, the EEOC was exercising authority explicitly delegated to it by Congress when it promulgated this rule.</p><p>The regulation was also promulgated pursuant to sufficiently formal procedures. Although the EEOC originally issued the regulation without undergoing formal noticeand-comment procedures, it was repromulgated pursuant to those procedures in 1977. See 42 Fed. Reg. 42022, 42023 <i>(1977); </i><i>id., </i>at 55388,55389. We recognized in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mead Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/case.html">533 U. S. 218</a> (2001), that although notice-andcomment procedures are not required for <i>Chevron </i>deference, notice-and-comment is "significant ... in pointing to <i>Chevron </i>authority," and that an "overwhelming number of our cases applying <i>Chevron </i>deference have reviewed the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication." 533 U. S., at 230-231. I see no reason why a repromulgation pursuant to notice-and-comment procedures should be less entitled to deference than an original promulgation pursuant to those procedures. Cf. <i>Smiley </i>v. <i>Citibank (South Dakota), </i>N. <i>A., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/517/735/case.html">517 U.
