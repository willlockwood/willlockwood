Triorient subchartered a vessel owned by respondent (Malaysia International), a Malaysian company, to transport the coils, and hired a stevedoring company to load the coils in Philadelphia.  A bill of lading, dated April 30, 2003, triggered payment under the letter of credit.  Sinochem petitioned a Chinese admiralty court for preservation of a maritime claim against Malaysia International and arrest of the vessel, alleging that the Malaysian company had falsely backdated the bill of lading.  The Chinese court ordered the ship arrested, and Sinochem timely filed a complaint in that tribunal.  The Chinese admiralty court rejected Malaysia International\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional objections to Sinochem\xe2\x80\x99s complaint and that ruling was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after the Chinese admiralty court ordered the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, Malaysia International filed this action in a United States District Court, asserting that Sinochem\xe2\x80\x99s preservation petition to the Chinese court contained misrepresentations, and seeking compensation for losses sustained due to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  Sinochem moved to dismiss on several grounds, including lack of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction and the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>under which a federal district court may dismiss an action if a court abroad is the more appropriate and convenient forum for adjudicating the controversy.  The District Court determined it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the cause, concluded it lacked personal jurisdiction over Sinochem under Pennsylvania law, conjectured that limited discovery might reveal that it had personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\xc2\xa04(k)(2), but dismissed on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds, finding that the case could be adjudicated adequately and more conveniently in the Chinese courts.  Agreeing that there was subject-matter jurisdiction and that personal jurisdiction could not be resolved <em>sans</em> discovery, the Third Circuit panel held that the District Court could not dismiss the case under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine unless and until it determined definitively that it had both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A district court has discretion to respond at once to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <em>forum non conveniens</em> plea, and need not take up first any other threshold objection.

Such a dismissal reflects a court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of a \xe2\x80\x9crange of considerations, most notably the convenience to the parties and the practical difficulties that can attend the adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Quackenbush</em> v. <em>Allstate Ins.

A defendant invoking <em>forum non conveniens</em> ordinarily bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s chosen forum.  When the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s choice is not its home forum, however, the presumption in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor \xe2\x80\x9capplies with less force,\xe2\x80\x9d for the assumption that the chosen forum is appropriate is then \xe2\x80\x9cless reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Piper Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>Reyno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/235/index.html">454 U.

A district court therefore may dispose of an action by a <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of convenience, fairness, and judicial economy so warrant.  <em>Forum non conveniens</em>, like other threshold issues, may involve a brush with \xe2\x80\x9cfactual and legal issues of the underlying dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Van Cauwenberghe</em> v. <em>Biard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/517/index.html">486 U. S. 517</a>, 529.  But the critical point, rendering a <em>forum non conveniens</em> determination a nonmerits issue that can be determined before taking up jurisdictional inquiries is this: Resolving a <em>forum non conveniens</em> motion does not entail any assumption by the court of substantive law-declaring power.  Statements in <em>Gulf Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Gilbert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/index.html">330 U. S. 501</a>, that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>forum non conveniens</em> can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 504, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all cases in which \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>forum non conveniens </em>comes into play, it presupposes at least two forums in which the defendant is amenable to process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 506\xe2\x80\x93507, account in large part for the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Those statements draw their meaning from the context in which they were embedded.  <em>Gulf Oil</em> answered in the affirmative the question whether a court that had jurisdiction over the cause and the parties and was a proper venue could nevertheless dismiss the action under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine.  <em>Gulf Oil</em> did not address the issue decided here: whether a federal court can presume, rather than dispositively decide, its jurisdiction before dismissing under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.  The quoted statements, confined to the setting in which they were made, are no hindrance to the decision reached today.  The Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s further concern\xe2\x80\x94that a court failing first to establish its jurisdiction could not condition a <em>forum non conveniens</em> dismissal on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of any statute of limitations defense or objection to the foreign forum\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, and thus could not shield the plaintiff against a foreign tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to entertain the suit\xe2\x80\x94is not implicated on these facts.  Malaysia International faces no genuine risk that the more convenient forum will not take up the case.  This Court therefore need not decide whether a court conditioning a <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal on the waiver of jurisdictional or limitations defenses in the foreign forum must first determine its own authority to adjudicate the case.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0This is a textbook case for immediate <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction presented an issue of first impression in the Third Circuit, and was considered at some length by the courts below.  Discovery concerning personal jurisdiction would have burdened Sinochem with expense and delay to scant purpose: The District Court inevitably would dismiss the case without reaching the merits, given its well-considered <em>forum non conveniens </em>appraisal.  Judicial economy is disserved by continuing litigation in the District Court given the proceedings long launched in China.  And the gravamen of Malaysia International\xe2\x80\x99s complaint\xe2\x80\x94misrepresentations to the Chinese admiralty court in securing the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in China\xe2\x80\x94is an issue best left for determination by the Chinese courts.  If, as in the mine run of cases, a court can readily determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the cause or the defendant, the proper course would be to dismiss on that ground.  But where subject-matter or personal jurisdiction is difficult to determine, and <em>forum non conveniens</em> considerations weigh heavily in favor of dismissal, the court properly takes the less burdensome course.

In 2003, petitioner Sinochem International Company Ltd. (Sinochem), a Chinese state-owned importer, contracted with Triorient Trading, Inc. (Triorient), a domestic corporation that is not a party to this suit, to purchase steel coils.  Pursuant to the agreement, Triorient would receive payment under a letter of credit by producing a valid bill of lading certifying that the coils had been loaded for shipment to China on or before April 30, 2003.

Triorient then hired a stevedoring company to load the steel coils at the Port of Philadelphia.  A bill of lading, dated April 30, 2003, triggered payment under the letter of credit.  <em>Id.</em>, at<em> </em>49a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 8, 2003, Sinochem petitioned the Guangzhou Admiralty Court in China for interim relief, <em>i.e</em>., preservation of a maritime claim against Malaysia International and arrest of the vessel that carried the steel coils to China.  In support of its petition, Sinochem alleged that the Malaysian company had falsely backdated the bill of lading.  The Chinese tribunal ordered the ship arrested the same day.  <em>Id.</em>, at 50a; App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931816 (CA3), pp. 56a\xe2\x80\x9357a (Civil Ruling of the Guangzhou Admiralty Court).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thereafter, on July 2, 2003, Sinochem timely filed a complaint against Malaysia International and others in the Guangzhou Admiralty Court.  Sinochem\xe2\x80\x99s complaint repeated the allegation that the bill of lading had been falsified resulting in unwarranted payment.  Malaysia International contested the jurisdiction of the Chinese tribunal.  Feb. 27 Memo &amp; Order, at 50a; App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931816 (CA3), pp. 52a\xe2\x80\x9353a (Civil Complaint in Guangzhou Admiralty Court).  The admiralty court rejected Malaysia International\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional objection, and that ruling was affirmed on appeal by the Guangdong Higher People\xe2\x80\x99s Court.  App. 16\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On June 23, 2003, shortly after the Chinese court ordered the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, Malaysia International filed the instant action against Sinochem in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Malaysia International asserted in its federal court pleading that Sinochem\xe2\x80\x99s preservation petition to the Guangzhou court negligently misrepresented the \xe2\x80\x9cvessel\xe2\x80\x99s fitness and suitability to load its cargo.\xe2\x80\x9d  Feb. 27 Memo &amp; Order, at 50a (internal quotation marks omitted).  As relief, Malaysia International sought compensation for the loss it sustained due to the delay caused by the ship\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  Sinochem moved to dismiss the suit on several grounds, including lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, lack of personal jurisdiction, <em>forum non conveniens</em>, and international comity.  App. in No. 04\xe2\x80\x931816 (CA3), pp. 14a\xe2\x80\x9320a, 39a\xe2\x80\x9340a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court first determined that it had subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.

The court next concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Sinochem under Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s long-arm statute, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \xc2\xa75301 <em>et seq</em>. (2002).  Nevertheless, the court conjectured, limited discovery might reveal that Sinochem\xe2\x80\x99s national contacts sufficed to establish personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\xc2\xa04(k)(2).  Feb. 27 Memo &amp; Order, at 55a\xe2\x80\x9363a.  The court did not permit such discovery, however, because it determined that the case could be adjudicated adequately and more conveniently in the Chinese courts.  <em>Id</em>., at 63a\xe2\x80\x9369a; Memorandum and Order of Apr. 13, 2004, No. Civ.

Feb. 27 Memo &amp; Order, at 67a.  Given the proceedings ongoing in China, and the absence of cause \xe2\x80\x9cto second-guess the authority of Chinese law or the competence of [Chinese] courts,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court granted the motion to dismiss under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.  <em>Id.</em>, at 68a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed there was subject-matter jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71333(1), and that the question of personal jurisdiction could not be resolved <em>sans</em> discovery.  Although the court determined that <em>forum non conveniens</em> is a nonmerits ground for dismissal, the majority nevertheless held that the District Court could not dismiss the case under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine unless and until it determined definitively that it had both subject-matter jurisdiction over the cause and personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  436 F.\xc2\xa03d 349 (CA3 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Stapleton dissented.

A district court therefore may dispose of an action by a <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of convenience, fairness, and judicial economy so warrant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Third Circuit observed, <em>Van Cauwenberghe</em> v. <em>Biard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/517/index.html">486 U. S. 517</a>, 527\xe2\x80\x93530 (1988), does not call for a different conclusion.  See 436 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 359\xe2\x80\x93360.  <em>Biard </em>presented the question whether a district court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>denial</em> of a motion to dismiss on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens </em>qualifies for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine of <em>Cohen</em> v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/337/541/index.html">337 U. S. 541</a> (1949).  <em>Biard</em>, 486 U. S., at 527.  The Court held that a refusal to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens</em>, an interlocutory order, does not fall within the circumscribed collateral order exception to the firm final judgment rule generally governing federal court proceedings.  In that context, the Court observed that some factors relevant to <em>forum non conveniens</em>, notably what evidence will bear on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim or on defenses to the claim, \xe2\x80\x9cwill substantially overlap factual and legal issues of the underlying dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 529.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That observation makes eminent sense when the question is whether an issue is so discrete from the merits as to justify departure from the rule that a party may not appeal until the district court has rendered a final judgment disassociating itself from the case.  See <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</em> v. <em>Livesay</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/463/index.html">437 U. S. 463</a>, 468 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo come within the \xe2\x80\x98small class\xe2\x80\x99 of decisions excepted from the final-judgment rule by <em>Cohen</em>, the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Biard</em>\xe2\x80\x99s point, however, does not carry over to the question here at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course a court may need to identify the claims presented and the evidence relevant to adjudicating those issues to intelligently rule on a <em>forum non conveniens</em> motion.  But other threshold issues may similarly involve a brush with \xe2\x80\x9cfactual and legal issues of the underlying dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Biard</em>, 486 U. S., at 529.  For example, in ruling on the nonmerits threshold question of personal jurisdiction, a court may be called upon to determine whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum relate to the claim advanced by the plaintiff.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Ruhrgas</em>,<em> </em>526 U. S., at 581, n.\xc2\xa04 (noting that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction rested on its conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cthat Marathon had not shown that Ruhrgas pursued the alleged pattern of fraud and misrepresentation during the Houston meetings\xe2\x80\x9d).  The critical point here, rendering a <em>forum non conveniens</em> determination a threshold, nonmerits issue in the relevant context, is simply this: Resolving a <em>forum non conveniens</em> motion does not entail any assumption by the court of substantive \xe2\x80\x9claw-declaring power.\xe2\x80\x9d  See<em> id</em>., at 584\xe2\x80\x93585 (quoting <em>In\xc2\xa0re Papandreou</em>, 139 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 255).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Statements in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Gulf Oil Corp.</em> v. <em>Gilbert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/index.html">330 U. S. 501</a> (1947), account in large part for the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>forum non conveniens </em>can come into play only after a domestic court determines that it has jurisdiction over the cause and the parties and is a proper venue for the action.  See 436 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 361\xe2\x80\x93362.  The Court said in <em>Gulf Oil</em> that \xe2\x80\x9cthe doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d 330 U. S., at 504, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all cases in which \xe2\x80\xa6 <em>forum non conveniens </em>comes into play, it presupposes at least two forums in which the defendant is amenable to process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 506\xe2\x80\x93507.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Those statements from <em>Gulf Oil</em>, perhaps less than \xe2\x80\x9cfelicitously\xe2\x80\x9d crafted, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 14, draw their meaning from the context in which they were embedded.  The question presented in <em>Gulf Oil</em> was whether a court fully competent to adjudicate the case, <em>i.e</em>., one that plainly had jurisdiction over the cause and the parties and was a proper venue, could nevertheless dismiss the action under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine.  The Court answered that question \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first statement\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>forum non conveniens</em> can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it is of course true that once a court determines that jurisdiction is lacking, it can proceed no further and must dismiss the case on that account.  In that scenario \xe2\x80\x9c<em>forum non conveniens</em> can never apply.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second statement\xe2\x80\x94that <em>forum non conveniens</em> \xe2\x80\x9cpresupposes at least two forums\xe2\x80\x9d with authority to adjudicate the case\xe2\x80\x94was made in response to the <em>Gulf Oil</em> plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s argument to this effect: Because the federal forum chosen by the plaintiff possessed jurisdiction and venue was proper, the court was obliged to adjudicate the case.  See 330 U. S., at 504 (explaining that a court\xe2\x80\x99s statutory empowerment to entertain a suit \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not settle the question whether it must do so\xe2\x80\x9d).  Notably, in speaking of what the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cpresupposes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court said nothing that would negate a court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to presume, rather than dispositively decide, the propriety of the forum in which the plaintiff filed suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, <em>Gulf Oil</em> did not present the question we here address: whether a federal court can dismiss under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine before definitively ascertaining its own jurisdiction.  Confining the statements we have quoted to the setting in which they were made, we find in <em>Gulf Oil</em> no hindrance to the decision we reach today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Third Circuit expressed the further concern that a court failing first to establish its jurisdiction could not  condition a <em>forum non conveniens</em> dismissal on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of any statute of limitations defense or objection to the foreign forum\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Unable so to condition a dismissal, the Court of Appeals feared, a court could not shield the plaintiff against a foreign tribunal\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to entertain the suit.  436 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 363, and n.\xc2\xa021.  Accord <em>In\xc2\xa0re</em> <em>Papandreou</em>, 139 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 256, n.\xc2\xa06.  Here, however, Malaysia International faces no genuine risk that the more convenient forum will not take up the case.  Proceedings to resolve the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute are underway in China, with Sinochem as the plaintiff.  Jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Admiralty Court has been raised, determined, and affirmed on appeal.  We therefore need not decide whether a court conditioning<em> </em>a<em> forum non conveniens</em> dismissal on the waiver of jurisdictional or limitations defenses in the foreign forum must first determine its own authority to adjudicate the case.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a textbook case for immediate <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction presented an issue of first impression in the Third Circuit, see 436 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 355, and was considered at some length by the courts below.  Discovery concerning personal jurisdiction would have burdened Sinochem with expense and delay.  And all to scant purpose: The District Court inevitably would dismiss the case without reaching the merits, given its well-considered <em>forum non conveniens </em>appraisal.  Judicial economy is disserved by continuing litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania given the proceedings long launched in China.  And the gravamen of Malaysia International\xe2\x80\x99s complaint\xe2\x80\x94misrepresentations to the Guangzhou Admiralty Court in the course of securing arrest of the vessel in China\xe2\x80\x94is an issue best left for determination by the Chinese courts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, however, a court can readily determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the cause or the defendant, the proper course would be to dismiss on that ground.  In the mine run of cases, jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cwill involve no arduous inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d and both judicial economy and the consideration ordinarily accorded the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s choice of forum \xe2\x80\x9cshould impel the federal court to dispose of [those] issue[s] first.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruhrgas</em>, 526 U. S., at 587\xe2\x80\x93588.  But where subject-matter or personal jurisdiction is difficult to determine, and <em>forum non conveniens</em> considerations weigh heavily in favor of dismissal, the court properly takes the less burdensome course.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
