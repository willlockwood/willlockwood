Karen applied for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District Court affirmed.  In accord with the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Social Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession.  The Third Circuit reversed.  It concluded that, under \xc2\xa7416(e), which defines child to mean, inter alia, \xe2\x80\x9cthe child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individual,\xe2\x80\x9d the undisputed biological children of an insured and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state intestacy law.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s reading is better attuned to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime.

Section 416(e), in turn, defines \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d to mean: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild [under certain circumstances], and (3) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the grandchild or stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(e)(2) and (3), \xc2\xa7416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits.  Section 416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term \xe2\x80\x9cchild,\xe2\x80\x9d providing: \xe2\x80\x9cIn determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individual\xe2\x80\x99s domiciliary State].\xe2\x80\x9d  An applicant who does not meet \xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for benefits under other criteria set forth in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria.  Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(h)(2) and (3) in defining \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ho is the insured\xe2\x80\x99s natural child,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 CFR \xc2\xa7404.355.  As the SSA reads the statute, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7416(h) governs the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d must pass.

There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive interpretation.

The dictionary definitions offered by respondent are not so confined.  Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see \xc2\xa7402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term \xe2\x80\x9cchild.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does \xc2\xa7416(e) indicate that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cbiological\xe2\x80\x9d parentage to be prerequisite to \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d status.  A biological parent is not always a child\xe2\x80\x99s parent under law.  Furthermore, marriage does not necessarily make a child\xe2\x80\x99s parentage certain, nor does the absence of marriage necessarily make a child\xe2\x80\x99s parentage uncertain.  Finally, it is far from obvious that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed definition would cover her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage ends upon the death of a spouse.

Respondent notes the absence of any cross-reference in \xc2\xa7416(e) to \xc2\xa7416(h), but she overlooks that \xc2\xa7416(h) provides the crucial link:  It requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for \xc2\xa7416(h) purposes, but \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7402(d) and 416(e).  Having explicitly complemented \xc2\xa7416(e) by the definitional provisions contained in \xc2\xa7416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in \xc2\xa7416(e).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status, including an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widower.  See, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(b), (h)(1)(A).  The Act also sets duration-of-relationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 749\n\xe2\x80\x93782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.  In contrast, no time constraint attends the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father\xe2\x80\x99s death and the child\xe2\x80\x99s conception and birth. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause a child who may take from a father\xe2\x80\x99s estate is more likely to \xe2\x80\x9cbe dependent during the parent\xe2\x80\x99s life and at his death,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews v. Lucas, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495\n, reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d serves the Act\xe2\x80\x99s driving objective, which is to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. dependent members of [a wage earner\xe2\x80\x99s] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured\xe2\x80\x99s] earnings,\xe2\x80\x9d Califano v. Jobst, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47\n.  Although the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows, as respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a \xc2\xa7416(h) criterion.  Respondent charges that the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause.  But under rational-basis review, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress easily passes inspection.

Chevron deference is appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

Robert died of cancer less than three years later.  With the help of in vitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Karen\xe2\x80\x99s application for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social Security Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this lit-igation.  The technology that made the twins\xe2\x80\x99 conception and birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated by Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social Security Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to read as they now do (1965).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKaren Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act\xe2\x80\x99s initial definition of \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d in \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7416(e): \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[C]hild\xe2\x80\x99 means .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the child or legally adopted child of an [insured] individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Robert was an insured individual, and the twins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of Karen and Robert.  That satisfies the Act\xe2\x80\x99s terms, and no further inquiry is in order, Karen maintains.  The SSA, however, identifies subsequent provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(h)(2) and (h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological children to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance from the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one of the statutory alternatives to that requirement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe conclude that the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s reading is better attuned to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and its design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage earner in his or her lifetime.

Despite Robert\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive treatment regime, Karen conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in August 2001.

The will made no provision for children conceived after Robert\xe2\x80\x99s death, although the Capatos had told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be placed on a par with existing children.

Robert Capato died domiciled in Florida, the court found.  Under that State\xe2\x80\x99s law, the court noted, a child born posthu-mously may inherit through intestate succession only if conceived during the decedent\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime.

The Act similarly defines the terms \xe2\x80\x9cwidow,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chusband,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwidower.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, as originally enacted, a single provision mandated the use of state intestacy law for \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of [an] insured individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7409(m) (1940 ed.).  All wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to satisfy the same criterion.  To be sure, children born during their parents\xe2\x80\x99 marriage would have readily qualified under the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility to inherit under state law.  But requiring all \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d ap-plicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a simple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly within the legislators\xe2\x80\x99 contemplation, while avoiding con-gressional entanglement in the traditional state-law realm of family relations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJust as the Act generally refers to state law to determine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow, husband, widower, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child or parent, \xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(b), (c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship limitations.  See Weinberger v. Salfi, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 749\n\xe2\x80\x93782 (1975) (discussing \xc2\xa7416(e)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that, as a check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild relationship must exist \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than nine months immediately preceding [insured\xe2\x80\x99s death]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Time limits also qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children.  See Cal. Prob.

No time constraints attend the Third Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father\xe2\x80\x99s death and the child\xe2\x80\x99s conception and birth.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that, under the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the Third Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her father\xe2\x80\x99s death would be eligible for benefits).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe paths to receipt of benefits laid out in the Act and regulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 perception of the core purpose of the legislation.  The aim was not to create a program \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally benefiting needy persons\xe2\x80\x9d; it was, more particularly, to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. dependent members of [a wage earner\xe2\x80\x99s] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured\xe2\x80\x99s] earnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Califano v. Jobst, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 47, \n52 (1977)\n.  We have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cwhere state intestacy law provides that a child may take personal property from a father\xe2\x80\x99s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the child will more likely be dependent during the parent\xe2\x80\x99s life and at his death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mathews v. Lucas, \n\n427 U.\xc2\xa0S. 495, \n514 (1976)\n.  Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d thus serves the Act\xe2\x80\x99s driving objective.  True, the intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children outside the Act\xe2\x80\x99s central concern.  Intestacy laws in a number of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance by posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and under federal law, a child conceived shortly before her father\xe2\x80\x99s death may be eligible for benefits even though she never actually received her father\xe2\x80\x99s support.  It was nonetheless Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prerogative to legislate for the generality of cases.  It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit under state intestacy law as a workable substitute for bur-densome case-by-case determinations whether the child was, in fact, dependent on her father\xe2\x80\x99s earnings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent argues that on the SSA\xe2\x80\x99s reading, natural children alone must pass through a \xc2\xa7416(h) gateway.  Adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-grandchildren, it is true, are defined in \xc2\xa7416(e), and are not further defined in \xc2\xa7416(h).  Respondent overlooks, however, that although not touched by \xc2\xa7416(h), beneficiaries described in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other statutorily prescribed criteria.  In short, the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, see 20 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7404.356\xe2\x80\x93404.358, but it hardly follows that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a \xc2\xa7416(h) criterion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe SSA\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the Act, respondent charges, raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro-tection component of the Due Process Clause.

We have applied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws \xe2\x80\x9cburden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the illicit relations of their parents, because \xe2\x80\x98visiting this condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and unjust.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Clark v.

No showing has been made that posthumously conceived children share the characteristics that prompted our skepticism of classifications disadvantaging children of unwed parents.

That aid is supplied by \xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of th[e] subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d that includes \xc2\xa7416(e)(1).  Under the completed definition, which the SSA employs, \xc2\xa7416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the status of a posthumously conceived child.  The SSA\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to without deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reading is therefore entitled to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s deference under Chevron, \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChevron deference is appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.
