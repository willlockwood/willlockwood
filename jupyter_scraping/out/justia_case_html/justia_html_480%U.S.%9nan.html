S. 11</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, an Iowa insurance company, brought this action in Federal District Court against members of the Blackfeet Indian Tribe resident on the Tribe\'s reservation in Montana.  The asserted basis for federal jurisdiction was diversity of citizenship.  At the time the action was initiated, proceedings involving the same parties and based on the same dispute were pending before the Blackfeet Tribal Court.  The question before us is whether a federal court may exercise diversity jurisdiction before the tribal court system has an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent Edward LaPlante, a member of the Blackfeet Indian Tribe, was employed by the Wellman Ranch Company, a Montana corporation.  The Wellman Ranch is located on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, and is owned by members of the Wellman family, who are also Blackfeet Indians residing on the Reservation.  Petitioner Iowa Mutual Insurance Company was the insurer of the Wellman Ranch and its individual owners.</p>\n<p>On May 3, 1982, LaPlante was driving a cattle truck within the boundaries of the Reservation.  While proceeding up a hill, he lost control of the vehicle and was injured when the truck "jackknifed."  Agents of Midland Claims Service, Inc., an independent insurance adjuster which represented Iowa Mutual in this matter, attempted unsuccessfully to settle LaPlante\'s claim.  In May, 1983, LaPlante and his wife Verla, also a Blackfeet Indian, filed a complaint in the Blackfeet Tribal Court.  The complaint stated two causes of action:  the first named the Wellman Ranch and its individual owners as defendants and sought compensation for LaPlante\'s personal injuries and his wife\'s loss of consortium; the second alleged a claim for compensatory and punitive damages against Iowa Mutual and Midland Claims for bad-faith refusal to settle. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="12">Page 480 U. S. 12</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Iowa Mutual and Midland Claims moved to dismiss for failure properly to allege Tribal Court jurisdiction and for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit.  The Tribal Court dismissed the complaint for failure to allege the factual basis of the court\'s jurisdiction, but it allowed the LaPlantes to amend their complaint to allege facts from which jurisdiction could be determined.  The Tribal Court also addressed the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the Tribe could regulate the conduct of non-Indians engaged in commercial relations with Indians on the reservation.  Since the Tribe\'s adjudicative jurisdiction was coextensive with its legislative jurisdiction, the court concluded that it would have jurisdiction over the suit. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Although the Blackfeet Tribal Code establishes a Court of Appeals, <em>see</em> ch. 11, \xc2\xa71, it does not allow interlocutory appeals from jurisdictional rulings.  Accordingly, appellate review of the Tribal Court\'s jurisdiction can occur only after a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p>Subsequent to the Tribal Court\'s jurisdictional ruling, Iowa Mutual filed the instant action in Federal District Court against the LaPlantes, the Wellmans, and the Wellman Ranch Company, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] alleging diversity of citizenship under 28 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 480 U. S. 13</a></p><p> U.S.C. \xc2\xa71332 as the basis for federal jurisdiction.  Iowa Mutual sought a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the Wellmans or the Ranch because the injuries sustained by the LaPlantes fell outside the coverage of the applicable insurance policies. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The LaPlantes moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the District Court granted the motion.  Relying on <em>R. J. Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Housing Authority,</em> 719 F.2d 979 (CA9 1983), the court held that the Blackfeet Tribal Court must first be given an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction.  The District Court noted that the Montana state courts lack jurisdiction over comparable suits filed by Montana insurance companies; [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] it indicated that its jurisdiction was similarly precluded because, based on its reading of <em>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/535/case.html">337 U. S. 535</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/535/case.html#538">337 U. S. 538</a></span> (1949), federal courts sitting in diversity operate solely as adjuncts to the state court system.  The District Court held that "[o]nly if the Blackfeet Tribe decides not to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction . . . would this court be free to entertain" the case under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71332.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s order.  774 F.2d 1174 (1985).  It found <em>R. J. Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Housing Authority, supra,</em> to be consistent with this Court\'s intervening decision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 480 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This policy reflects the fact that Indian tribes retain "attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory," <em>United States v.

If state court jurisdiction over Indians or activities on Indian lands would interfere with tribal sovereignty and self-government, the state courts are generally divested of jurisdiction as a matter of federal law.  <em>See Fisher v.

The school district and its insurer sought injunctive relief in District Court, invoking 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71331 as the basis for federal jurisdiction and claiming that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over non-Indians.  The District Court agreed, and entered an injunction against execution of the Tribal Court\'s judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction.  We refused to foreclose tribal court jurisdiction over a civil dispute involving a non-Indian.  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html#855">471 U.

We concluded that, although the existence of tribal court jurisdiction presented a federal question within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71331, considerations of comity direct that tribal remedies be exhausted before the question is addressed by the District Court.  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html#857">471 U.

S. 857</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although petitioner alleges that federal jurisdiction in this case is based on diversity of citizenship, rather than the existence of a federal question, the exhaustion rule announced in <em>National Farmers Union</em> applies here as well.  Regardless of the basis for jurisdiction, the federal policy supporting tribal self-government directs a federal court to stay its hand in order to give the tribal court a "full opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In diversity cases, as well as federal question cases, unconditional access to the federal forum would place it in direct competition with the Tribal courts, thereby impairing the latter\'s authority over reservation affairs.  <em>See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html">436 U. S. 49</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/49/case.html#59">436 U.

Adjudication of such matters by any nontribal court also infringes upon tribal lawmaking authority, because tribal courts are best qualified to interpret and apply tribal law.</p>\n<p>As <em>National Farmers Union</em> indicates, proper respect for tribal legal institutions requires that they be given a "full opportunity" to consider the issues before them and "to rectify any errors."  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html#857">471 U. S. 857</a></span>.  The federal policy of promoting tribal self-government encompasses the development </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 480 U. S. 17</a></p><p> of the entire tribal court system, including appellate courts.  At a minimum, exhaustion of tribal remedies means that tribal appellate courts must have the opportunity to review the determinations of the lower tribal courts.  In this case, the Tribal Court has made an initial determination that it has jurisdiction over the insurance dispute, but Iowa Mutual has not yet obtained appellate review, as provided by the Tribal Code, ch. 1, \xc2\xa7 5.  Until appellate review is complete, the Blackfeet Tribal Courts have not had a full opportunity to evaluate the claim, and federal courts should not intervene.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the statutory grant of diversity jurisdiction overrides the federal policy of deference to tribal courts.  We do not agree.  Although Congress undoubtedly has the power to limit tribal court jurisdiction, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] we do not read the general grant of diversity jurisdiction to have implemented such a significant intrusion on tribal sovereignty, any more than we view the grant of federal question jurisdiction, the statutory basis for the intrusion on tribal jurisdiction at issue in <em>National Farmers Union,</em> to have done so.  The diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71332, makes no reference to Indians, and nothing in the legislative history suggests any intent to render inoperative the established federal policy promoting tribal self-government.  Tribal courts in the Anglo-American mold were virtually unknown in 1789, when Congress first authorized diversity jurisdiction, <em>see</em> Judiciary Act of 1789, \xc2\xa711, 1 Stat. 78-79, and the original statute did not manifest a congressional intent to limit tribal sovereignty.  Moreover, until the late 19th century, most Indians were neither considered citizens of the States in which their reservation was located nor regarded as citizens of a foreign State, <em>see, e.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/30/1/case.html">30 U.

The jurisdictional basis for this suit was 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71331.  The District Court dismissed this suit for failure to state a claim, and both companies appealed.

Tribal consent is now a prerequisite to the assumption of jurisdiction, <em>see</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71326, and the Blackfeet Tribe has not consented to state jurisdiction.

While petitioner contends that tribal court jurisdiction over outsiders "is questionable at best," Reply Brief for Petitioner 6, it does not argue that the present action is "patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions," nor do we understand it to invoke any of the other exceptions enumerated in <em>National Farmers Union.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also relied on <em>Woods v.

Following its earlier decision in <em>R. J. Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Housing Authority,</em> 719 F.2d 979, 982 (1983), the court held that diversity jurisdiction would be barred as long as the courts of the State in which the federal court sits would not entertain the suit, apparently assuming that the exercise of federal jurisdiction would contravene a substantive state policy.  However, it is not clear that Montana has such a policy, since state court jurisdiction seems to be precluded by the application of the federal substantive policy of non-infringement, rather than any state substantive policy.  <em>See, e.g., Milbank Mutual Ins. Co. v. Eagleman,</em> 218 Mont. 35, 705 P. 2d 1117 (1985).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>On remand, the District Court should consider whether, on the facts of this case, the federal action should be stayed pending further Tribal Court proceedings or dismissed under the prudential rule announced in <em>National Farmers Union.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The complaint filed by petitioner in the United States District Court for the District of Montana raised questions concerning the coverage of the insurance policy that petitioner had issued to respondents Wellman Ranch Co. and its owners.  Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd 8, 9 (App. 3-4).  It did not raise any question concerning the jurisdiction of the Blackfeet Tribal Court.  For purposes of our decision, it is therefore appropriate to assume that the Tribal Court and the Federal District Court had concurrent jurisdiction over the dispute.  The question presented is whether the Tribal Court\'s jurisdiction is a sufficient reason for requiring the federal court to decline to exercise its own jurisdiction until the Tribal Court has decided the case on the merits.  In my opinion it is not. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 480 U. S. 21</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A federal court must always show respect for the jurisdiction of other tribunals.  Specifically, only in the most extraordinary circumstances should a federal court enjoin the conduct of litigation in a state court or a tribal court.  Thus, in <em>National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html">471 U. S. 845</a></span> (1985), we held that the Federal District Court should not entertain a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Crow Tribal Court until after petitioner had exhausted its remedies in the Tribal Court.  Our holding was based on our belief that Congress\' policy of supporting tribal self-determination</p>\n<p>"favors a rule that will provide the forum <em>whose jurisdiction is being challenged</em> the first opportunity to evaluate the factual and legal bases for the challenge."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html#856">471 U. S. 856</a></span> (emphasis added; footnote omitted).  We have enforced a similar exhaustion requirement in cases challenging the jurisdiction of state tribunals.  <em>See, e.g., Juidice v. Vail,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html">430 U. S. 327</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/327/case.html#335">430 U. S. 335</a></span>-336 (1977).</p>\n<p>The deference given to the deliberations of tribal courts on the merits of a dispute, however, is a separate matter as to which <em>National Farmers Union</em> offers no controlling precedent.  Indeed, in holding that exhaustion of the tribal jurisdictional issue was necessary, we explicitly contemplated later federal court consideration of the merits of the dispute.  We noted that</p>\n<p>"the orderly administration of justice in the federal court will be served by allowing a full record to be developed in the Tribal Court before either the merits or any question concerning appropriate relief is addressed."</p>\n<p>471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/845/case.html#856">471 U. S. 856</a></span> (footnote omitted).  I see no reason why tribal courts should receive more deference on the merits than state courts.  It is not unusual for a state court and a federal court to have concurrent jurisdiction over the same dispute.  In some such cases, it is appropriate for the federal court to stay its hand until the state court litigation has terminated, <em>see, e.g., Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html">424 U. S. 800</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#813">424 U. S. 813</a></span>-816 (1976), but, as we have consistently held, "[a]bstention from the exercise </p><p><a class="page-number" name="22">Page 480 U. S. 22</a></p><p> of federal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/case.html#813">424 U. S. 813</a></span>.  The mere fact that a case involving the same issue is pending in another court has never been considered a sufficient reason to excuse a federal court from performing its duty "to adjudicate a controversy properly before it."  <em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/185/case.html">360 U. S. 185</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/185/case.html#188">360 U. S. 188</a></span> (1959).  On the contrary, as between state and federal courts, the general rule is that "the pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction . . . ."  <em>McClellan v. Carland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/case.html">217 U.

In this case, a controversy concerning the coverage of the insurance policy issued to respondents Wellman Ranch Co. and its owners by petitioner is properly before the Federal District Court. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/9/case.html">*</a></span>  That controversy raises no question concerning the jurisdiction of the Blackfeet Tribal Court.</p>\n<p>Adherence to this doctrine, by allowing the declaratory judgment action to proceed in District Court, would imply no disrespect for the Blackfeet Tribe or for its judiciary.  It would merely avoid what I regard as the anomalous suggestion that the sovereignty of an Indian tribe is in some respects greater than that of the State of Montana, for example.</p>\n<p>Until today, we have never suggested that an Indian tribe\'s judicial system is entitled to a greater degree of deference than the judicial system of a sovereign State.  Today\'s opinion, however, requires the federal court to avoid adjudicating the merits of a controversy also pending in tribal court although it could reach those merits if the case, instead, were pending in state court.  Thus, although I of course agree with the Court\'s conclusion that the Federal District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case, I respectfully dissent from its exhaustion holding.,</p>\n<p>* The Court seems to assume that the merits of this controversy are governed by "tribal law."  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/9/case.html#16">480 U.
