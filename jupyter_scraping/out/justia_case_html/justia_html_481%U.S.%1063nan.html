Tucker\'s petition for certiorari raises the question whether inflammatory and prejudicial photographs of the victim\'s body introduced at trial violated his constitutional right to "fundamental fairness and a reliable sentencing determination." Pet. for Cert. i. This question is sufficiently similar to a question that will be decided by the Court in Thompson v.

I dissent. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Among the questions presented in Thompson is:</p><ul>"May admission of inflammatory evidence [i.e., two photos of murder victim] in capital case against 16-year-old defendant be deemed harmless error merely because of strong evidence of guilt, when such evidence also prejudices defendant\'s right to fair, full jury consideration of all mitigating circumstances-including age-during death penalty deliberations?" </ul> <p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> It is true that in Thompson the court below found that admission of the photographs at issue was error, but harmless, while here the court found no error in the admission of the photographs. This difference is not significant. In Thompson, in order to overturn the State court\'s determination of harmless error, we would have to find both that the admission of the photographs at issue violated the defendant\'s due process rights under the Federal Constitution, and that the error was not harmless . In order to overturn the State Court\'s determination that no error occurred in Tucker, we would have to find only the first of these, namely that the admission of the photographs at issue violated these same Federal Constitutional rights. Plainly, any standard we might develop in deciding whether sufficient prejudice existed to render an error harmful would be applicable in a decision whether sufficient possibility of prejudice existed to render admission of evidence error. The possibility that the analysis in Thompson will shed light on Tucker is therefore sufficient to justify a hold. </p><p> <br/><br/><br/>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1957061">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> TUCKER v.
