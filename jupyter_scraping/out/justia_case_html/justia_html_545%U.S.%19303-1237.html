S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7271(e)(1).  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) is such a law.  Under the FDCA, a drug maker must submit research data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an investigational new drug application (IND) when seeking authorization to conduct human clinical trials, and in a new drug application (NDA) when seeking authorization to market a new drug.  Respondents filed a patent-infringement suit, claiming, <em>inter alia,</em> that petitioner had willfully infringed their patents by supplying respondents\xe2\x80\x99 RGD peptides to other defendants for use in preclinical research.  Petitioner answered, among other things, that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) exempted its actions from infringement.  The jury found otherwise and awarded damages.  In post-trial motions, the District Court affirmed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s award and denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law.  The Federal Circuit affirmed that denial, finding that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s safe harbor did not apply.  It reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to modify the damages award and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is protected under \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) at least as long as there is a reasonable basis to believe that the compound tested could be the subject of an FDA submission and the experiments will produce the types of information relevant to an IND or NDA.  The statutory text makes clear that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) provides a wide berth for the use of patented drugs in activities related to the federal regulatory process, including uses reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the FDCA.  <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/661/index.html">496 U.

This necessarily includes preclinical studies, both those pertaining to a drug\xe2\x80\x99s safety in humans and those related to, <em>e.g.,</em> a drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy and mechanism of action.  Additionally, \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of patented compounds in preclinical research, even when the patented compounds do not themselves become the subject of an FDA submission.  The \xe2\x80\x9creasonable relation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement cannot be read effectively to limit \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s stated protection of activities leading to FDA approval for all drugs to those activities leading to FDA approval for generic drugs.  Similarly, the use of a patented compound in experiments not themselves included in a \xe2\x80\x9csubmission of information\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA does not, standing alone, render the use infringing.  Because the Federal Circuit applied the wrong standard in rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that petitioner failed to show that its activities were covered by \xc2\xa7271(e)(1), the trial evidence has yet to be reviewed under the standard set forth in the jury instruction, and developed in more detail here.

App. 95a\xe2\x80\x93107a.  The proposal set forth a 3-year timetable in which to develop \xe2\x80\x9cintegrin antagonists as angiogenesis inhibitors,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 105a, beginning with <em>in vitro </em>and <em>in vivo </em>testing of RGD peptides at Scripps in year one and culminating with the submission of an IND to the FDA in year three, <em>id.</em>, at 106a\xe2\x80\x93107a.  Petitioner agreed to the material terms of the proposal on February 20, 1995, <em>id.</em>, at 124a\xe2\x80\x93125a, and on April 13, 1995, pledged $6 million over three years to fund research at Scripps, <em>id.</em>, at 126a.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s April 13 letter specified that Scripps would be responsible for testing RGD peptides produced by petitioner as potential drug candidates but that, once a primary candidate for clinical testing was in \xe2\x80\x9cthe pipeline,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner would perform the toxicology tests necessary for FDA approval to proceed to clinical trials.  <em>Id.</em>, at 127a; see 21 CFR \xc2\xa7312.23(a)(8)(iii) (2005) (requirement that \xe2\x80\x9cnonclinical laboratory study\xe2\x80\x9d include a certification that it was performed under good laboratory practices); see also \xc2\xa758.3(d) (2004) (defining \xe2\x80\x9c[n]onclinical laboratory study\xe2\x80\x9d).

These experiments focused on EMD 66203 and two closely related derivatives, EMD 85189 and EMD 121974, and were designed to evaluate the suitability of each of the peptides as potential drug candidates.  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 863.  Accordingly, the tests measured the efficacy, specificity, and toxicity of the particular peptides as angiogenesis inhibitors, and evaluated their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics in animals.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Based on the test results, Scripps decided in 1997 that EMD 121974 was the most promising candidate for testing in humans.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Over the same period, Scripps performed similar tests on LM609, a monoclonal antibody developed by Dr. Cheresh.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  App. 277a, 285a\xe2\x80\x93298a.

Petitioner originally directed its efforts at EMD 85189, but switched focus in April 1997 to EMD 121974.  Case No. 96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x931307, App. 31a.  Petitioner subsequently discussed EMD 121974 with officials at the FDA.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397a.  In October 1998, petitioner shared its research on RGD peptides with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which agreed to sponsor clinical trials.  <em>Id.</em>, at 214a\xe2\x80\x93217a.  Although the fact was excluded from evidence at trial, the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reflects that NCI filed an IND for EMD 121974 in 1998.  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 874 (Newman, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On July 18, 1996, respondents filed a patent-infringement suit against petitioner, Scripps, and Dr. Cheresh in the District Court for the Southern District of California.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleged that petitioner willfully infringed and induced others to infringe respondents\xe2\x80\x99 patents by supplying the RGD peptide to Scripps, and that Dr. Cheresh and Scripps infringed the same patents by using the RGD peptide in experiments related to angiogenesis.  Respondents sought damages from petitioner and a declaratory judgment against Dr. Cheresh and Scripps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 863.  Petitioner answered that its actions involving the RGD peptides did not infringe respondents\xe2\x80\x99 patents, and that in any event they were protected by the common-law research exemption and 35 U.

With the consent of the parties, the District Court gave the following instruction regarding the \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) exemption:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo prevail on this defense, [petitioner] must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be objectively reasonable for a party in [petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s] and Scripps\xe2\x80\x99 situation to believe that there was a decent prospect that the accused activities would contribute, relatively directly, to the generation of the kinds of information that are likely to be relevant in the processes by which the FDA would decide whether to approve the product in question.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEach of the accused activities must be evaluated separately to determine whether the exemption applies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[Petitioner] does not need to show that the information gathered from a particular activity was actually submitted to the FDA.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 57a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe jury found that petitioner, Dr. Cheresh, and Scripps infringed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 patents and that petitioner had failed to show that its activities were protected by \xc2\xa7271(e)(1).  It awarded damages of $15 million.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to post-trial motions, the District Court dismissed respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit against Dr. Cheresh and Scripps, but affirmed the jury\xe2\x80\x99s damage award as supported by substantial evidence, Civ. Action No. 961307 JMF (SD Cal. Mar. 26, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, and denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment as a matter of law, Civ. Action No. 96CV\xe2\x80\x931307 JMF (SD Cal., Mar. 6, 2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a.  With respect to the last, the District Court explained that the evidence was sufficient to show that \xe2\x80\x9cany connection between the infringing Scripps experiments and FDA review was insufficiently direct to qualify for the [\xc2\xa7271(e)(1) exemption].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 49a.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part.  The panel majority affirmed the denial of judgment as a matter of law to petitioner, on the ground that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s safe harbor did not apply because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Scripps work sponsored by [petitioner] was not clinical testing to supply information to the FDA, but only general biomedical research to identify new pharmaceutical compounds.\xe2\x80\x9d  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 866.

Cf. <em>Eli Lilly</em>, 496 U. S., at 665\xe2\x80\x93669 (declining to limit \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption from infringement to submissions under particular statutory provisions that regulate drugs).  This necessarily includes preclinical studies of patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to the FDA in the regulatory process.  There is simply no room in the statute for excluding certain information from the exemption on the basis of the phase of research in which it is developed or the particular submission in which it could be included.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents concede the breadth of \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) in this regard, but argue that the only preclinical data of interest to the FDA is that which pertains to the safety of the drug in humans.  In respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, preclinical studies related to a drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology are not reasonably included in an IND or an NDA, and are therefore outside the scope of the exemption.  We do not understand the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s interest in information gathered in preclinical studies to be so constrained.  To be sure, its regulations provide that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprimary objectives in reviewing an IND are \xe2\x80\xa6 to assure the safety and rights of subjects,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 CFR 312.22(a) (2005), but it does not follow that the FDA is not interested in reviewing information related to other characteristics of a drug.  To the contrary, the FDA requires that applicants include in an IND summaries of the pharmacological, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, and biological qualities of the drug in animals.  See \xc2\xa7312.23(a)(5); Department of Health and Human Services, Guidance for Industry, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance 45 (Apr. 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe results of all relevant nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and investigational product metabolism studies should be provided in summary form.  This summary should address the methodology used, the results, and a discussion of the relevance of the findings to the investigated therapeutic and the possible unfavorable and unintended effects in humans\xe2\x80\x9d).  The primary (and, in some cases, only) way in which a drugmaker may obtain such information is through preclinical <em>in vitro </em>and <em>in vivo</em> studies.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the FDA does not evaluate the safety of proposed clinical experiments in a vacuum; rather, as the statute and regulations reflect, it asks whether the proposed clinical trial poses an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7355(i)(3)(B)(i); see also 21 CFR \xc2\xa7312.23(a)(8) (2005) (requiring applicants to include pharmacological and toxicological studies that serve as the basis of their conclusion that clinical testing would be \xe2\x80\x9creasonably safe\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa756.111(a)(2) (2004) (providing that the Institutional Review Boards that oversee clinical trials must consider whether the \xe2\x80\x9c[r]isks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits\xe2\x80\x9d).  This assessment involves a comparison of the risks and the benefits associated with the proposed clinical trials.  As the Government\xe2\x80\x99s brief, filed on behalf of the FDA, explains, the \xe2\x80\x9cFDA might allow clinical testing of a drug that posed significant safety concerns if the drug had a sufficiently positive potential to address a serious disease, although the agency would not accept similar risks for a drug that was less likely to succeed or that would treat a less serious medical condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10.  Accordingly, the FDA directs that an IND must provide sufficient information for the investigator to \xe2\x80\x9cmake his/her own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the proposed trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Guidance for Industry, <em>supra</em>, at 43.  Such information necessarily includes preclinical studies of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy in achieving particular results. </p>\n<p align="left">Respondents contend that, even accepting that the FDA is interested in preclinical research concerning drug characteristics other than safety, the experiments in question here are necessarily disqualified because they were not conducted in conformity with the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s good laboratory practices regulations.  This argument fails for at least two reasons.  First, the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that preclinical studies be conducted under \xe2\x80\x9cgood laboratory practices\xe2\x80\x9d applies only to experiments on drugs \xe2\x80\x9cto determine their safety,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 CFR \xc2\xa758.3(d).  See 21 CFR \xc2\xa758.1(a); \xc2\xa7312.23(a)(8)(iii) (2005) (only \xe2\x80\x9cnonclinical laboratory study subject to the good laboratory practice regulations under part 58\xe2\x80\x9d must certify compliance with good laboratory practice regulations).  The good laboratory practice regulations do not apply to preclinical studies of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy, mechanism of action, pharmacology, or pharmacokinetics.  Second, FDA regulations do not provide that even safety-related experiments not conducted in compliance with good laboratory practices regulations are not suitable for submission in an IND.  Rather, such studies must include \xe2\x80\x9ca brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) did not protect petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s provision of the patented RGD peptides for research at Scripps appeared to rest on two somewhat related propositions.  First, the court credited the fact that the \xe2\x80\x9cScripps-Merck experiments did not supply information for submission to the [FDA], but instead identified the best drug candidate to subject to future clinical testing under the FDA processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  331 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 865; see also <em>id</em>., at 866 (similar).   The court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe FDA has no interest in the hunt for drugs that may or may not later undergo clinical testing for FDA approval.  For instance, the FDA does not require information about drugs other than the compound featured in an [IND] application.  Thus, the Scripps work sponsored by [petitioner] was not \xe2\x80\x98solely for uses reasonably related to\xe2\x80\x99 clinical testing for FDA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>\n<p align="left">\nSecond, the court concluded that the exemption \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not globally embrace all experimental activity that at some point, however attenuated, may lead to an FDA approval process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 867.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not quibble with the latter statement.  Basic scientific research on a particular compound, performed without the intent to develop a particular drug or a reasonable belief that the compound will cause the sort of physiological effect the researcher intends to induce, is surely not \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related to the development and submission of information\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA.  It does not follow from this, however, that \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption from infringement categorically excludes either (1) experimentation on drugs that are not ultimately the subject of an FDA submission or (2) use of patented compounds in experiments that are not ultimately submitted to the FDA.  Under certain conditions, we think the exemption is sufficiently broad to protect the use of patented compounds in both situations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first proposition, it disregards the reality that, even at late stages in the development of a new drug, scientific testing is a process of trial and error.  In the vast majority of cases, neither the drugmaker nor its scientists have any way of knowing whether an initially promising candidate will prove successful over a battery of experiments.  That is the reason they conduct the experiments.  Thus, to construe \xc2\xa7271(e)(1), as the Court of Appeals did, not to protect research conducted on patented compounds for which an IND is not ultimately filed is effectively to limit assurance of exemption to the activities necessary to seek approval of a generic drug: One can know at the outset that a particular compound will be the subject of an eventual application to the FDA only if the active ingredient in the drug being tested is identical to that in a drug that has already been approved.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory text does not require such a result.  Congress did not limit \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s safe harbor to the development of information for inclusion in a submission to the FDA; nor did it create an exemption applicable only to the research relevant to filing an ANDA for approval of a generic drug.  Rather, it exempted from infringement <em>all</em> uses of patented compounds \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to the process of developing information for submission under <em>any </em>federal law regulating the manufacture, use, or distribution of drugs.  See <em>Eli Lilly</em>, 496 U. S., at 674.  We decline to read the \xe2\x80\x9creasonable relation\xe2\x80\x9d requirement so narrowly as to render \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s stated protection of activities leading to FDA approval for all drugs illusory.  Properly construed, \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) leaves adequate space for experimentation and failure on the road to regulatory approval: At least where a drugmaker has a reasonable basis for believing that a patented compound may work, through a particular biological process, to produce a particular physiological effect, and uses the compound in research that, if successful, would be appropriate to include in a submission to the FDA, that use is \xe2\x80\x9creasonably related\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment and submission of information under . . . Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7271(e)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For similar reasons, the use of a patented compound in experiments that are not themselves included in a \xe2\x80\x9csubmission of information\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA does not, standing alone, render the use infringing.  The relationship of the use of a patented compound in a particular experiment to the \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment and submission of information\xe2\x80\x9d to the FDA does not become more attenuated (or less reasonable) simply because the data from that experiment are left out of the submission that is ultimately passed along to the FDA.  Moreover, many of the uncertainties that exist with respect to the selection of a specific drug exist as well with respect to the decision of what research to include in an IND or NDA.  As a District Court has observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t will not always be clear to parties setting out to seek FDA approval for their new product exactly which kinds of information, and in what quantities, it will take to win that agency\xe2\x80\x99s approval.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Intermedics, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ventritex, Inc.</em>, 775 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1269, 1280 (ND Cal. 1991), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 991 F.\xc2\xa02d 808 (CA Fed. 1993).  This is especially true at the preclinical stage of drug approval.  FDA regulations provide only that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he amount of information on a particular drug that must be submitted in an IND . . . depends upon such factors as the novelty of the drug, the extent to which it has been studied previously, the known or suspected risks, and the developmental phase of the drug.\xe2\x80\x9d  21 CFR \xc2\xa7312.22(b).  We thus agree with the Government that the use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is protected under \xc2\xa7271(e)(1) as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the experiments will produce \xe2\x80\x9cthe types of information that are relevant to an IND or NDA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief of United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the Court of Appeals, petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that it failed to show that \xe2\x80\x9call of the accused activities are covered by [\xc2\xa7271(e)(1)].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 62a.

The Court of Appeals recognized that information included in an IND would come within \xc2\xa7271(e)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s safe harbor.  <em>Ibid</em>.
