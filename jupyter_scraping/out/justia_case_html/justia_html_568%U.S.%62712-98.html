A North Carolina statute requires that up to one-third of any damages recovered by a beneficiary for a tortious injury be paid to the State to reimburse it for payments it made for medical treatment on account of the injury.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. was born with multiple serious birth injuries that require her to receive between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing care per day and that will prevent her from being able to work, live independently, or provide for her basic needs.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid program pays part of the cost of her ongoing medical care.  E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the physician who delivered her and the hospital where she was born.  They presented expert testimony estimating their damages to exceed $42 million, but they ultimately settled for $2.8 million, due in large part to insurance policy limits.  The settlement did not allocate money among their various medical and nonmedical claims.  In approving the settlement, the state court placed one-third of the recovery into escrow pending a judicial determination of the amount of the lien owed by E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. to the State.  E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents then sought declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming that the State\xe2\x80\x99s reimbursement scheme violated the Medicaid anti-lien provision.  While that litigation was pending, the North Carolina Supreme Court held in another case that the irrebuttable statutory one-third presumption was a reasonable method for determining the amount due the State for medical expenses.  The Federal District Court, in the instant case, agreed.  But the Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded, concluding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory scheme could not be reconciled with Ahlborn.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The federal anti-lien provision pre-empts North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s irrebuttable statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.

Federal law requires an assignment to the State of \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to recover that portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 282, 284.  Ahlborn did not, however, resolve the question of how to determine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical care.  As North Carolina construes its statute, when the State\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid expenditures exceed one-third of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery, the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses, even if the settlement or verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical expenses.

It directly conflicts with the federal Medicaid statute and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cmust give way.\xe2\x80\x9d  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The state law has no process for determining what portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.  Instead, the State has picked an arbitrary percentage and by statutory command labeled that portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery as representing payment for medical care.  A State may not evade pre-emption through creative statutory interpretation or description, \xe2\x80\x9cframing\xe2\x80\x9d its law in a way that is at odds with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s intended operation and effect.  National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s argument, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the context of tort recoveries.  It lacks any limiting principle: If a State could arbitrarily designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medical expenses, it could arbitrarily designate half or all of the recovery in the same way.  The State offers no evidence showing that its allocation is reasonable in the mine run of cases, and the law provides no mechanism for determining whether its allocation is reasonable in any particular case. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNo estimate of an allocation will be necessary where there has been a judicial finding or approval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical damages.  In some cases, including Ahlborn, this binding stipulation or judgment will attribute to medical expenses less than one-third of the settlement.  Yet even in these circumstances, North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s statute would permit the State to take one-third of the total recovery.  A conflict thus exists between North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law and the Medicaid anti-lien provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is not as clear-cut as Ahlborn was, for here there was no such stipulation or judgment.  But Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning and the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s design contemplate that possibility: They envisioned that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary where a beneficiary and the State are unable to agree on what portion of a settlement represents compensation for medical expenses.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 288.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid Act\xe2\x80\x99s clear mandate that a State may not demand any portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical ex-penses.

The expert witnesses for E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents in that proceeding estimated damages in excess of $42 million for medical and life-care expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and other assorted expenses such as architectural renovations to their home and specialized transportation equipment.

E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents informed the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services of the negotiations.  The department had a statutory right to intervene in the malpractice suit and participate in the settlement negotiations in order to obtain reimbursement for the medical expenses it paid on E.

While that litigation was pending, the North Carolina Supreme Court con-fronted the same question in Andrews, supra.  It held that the irrebuttable statutory presumption that one-third of a Medicaid beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses was \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable method for determining the State\xe2\x80\x99s medical reimbursements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 604, 669 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 314.

E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. v. Cansler, 674 F.\xc2\xa03d 290 (2012).  It concluded that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s statutory scheme could not be reconciled with \xe2\x80\x9cAhlborn\xe2\x80\x99s clear holding that the general anti-lien provision in federal Medicaid law prohibits a state from recovering any portion of a settlement or judgment not attributable to medical expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 310.  In some cases, the court reasoned, the actual portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery representing payment for medical care would be less than one-third.  North Caro-lina\xe2\x80\x99s statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses therefore must be \xe2\x80\x9csubject to adversarial testing\xe2\x80\x9d in a judicial or administrative proceeding.

Congress has directed States, in administering their Medicaid programs, to seek reimbursement for medical expenses incurred on behalf of beneficiaries who later recover from third-party tortfeasors.  States must require beneficiaries \xe2\x80\x9cto assign the State any rights . . . to support (specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order) and to payment for medical care from any third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396k(a)(1)(A).  States receiving Medi-caid funds must also\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cha[ve] in effect laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA separate provision of the Medicaid statute, however, exists in some tension with these requirements.  It says that, with exceptions not relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the State plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71396p(a)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Ahlborn, the Court addressed this tension and held that the Medicaid statute sets both a floor and a ceiling on a State\xe2\x80\x99s potential share of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery.  Federal law requires an assignment to the State of \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to recover that portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care,\xe2\x80\x9d but it also \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 282, 284.  This is so because the beneficiary has a property right in the proceeds of the settlement, bringing it within the ambit of the anti-lien provision.  Id., at 285.  That property right is subject to the specific statutory \xe2\x80\x9cexception\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a State to seek reimbursement for medical expenses paid on the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, but the anti-lien provision protects the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the remainder of the settlement.  Id., at 284.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA question the Court had no occasion to resolve in Ahlborn is how to determine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical care.  The parties in that case stipulated that about 6 percent of respondent Ahlborn\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery (approximately $35,600 of a $550,000 settlement) represented compensation for medical care.  Id., at 274.  The Court nonetheless anticipated the concern that some settlements would not include an itemized allocation.  It also recognized the possibility that Medicaid beneficiaries and tortfeasors might collaborate to allocate an artificially low portion of a settlement to medical expenses.  The Court noted that these problems could \xe2\x80\x9cbe avoided either by obtaining the State\xe2\x80\x99s advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 288.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNorth Carolina has attempted a different approach.

North Carolina Dept. of Human Resources, 153 N.\xc2\xa0C. App. 305, 307\xe2\x80\x93308, 569 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 670, 672 (2002).  See also Ezell v. Grace Hospital, Inc., 360 N.\xc2\xa0C. 529, 631 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 131 (2006) (per curiam).  Under Ahlborn, however, this construction of the statute is at odds with the Medicaid anti-lien provision, which \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes attachment or encum- brance\xe2\x80\x9d of any portion of a settlement not \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated as payments for medical care.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 284.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn response to Ahlborn, the State advanced\xe2\x80\x94and the North Carolina Supreme Court in Andrews accepted\xe2\x80\x94 a new interpretation of its statute.  Under this interpretation the statute \xe2\x80\x9cdefines \xe2\x80\x98the portion of the settlement that represents payment for medical expenses\xe2\x80\x99 as the lesser of the State\xe2\x80\x99s past medical expenditures or one-third of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s total recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  Andrews, 362 N.\xc2\xa0C., at 604,  669 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 314.  In other words, when the State\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid expenditures on behalf of a beneficiary exceed one-third of the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery, the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses.  Under this reading of the statute the presumption operates even if the settlement or a jury verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical expenses.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Cf.

Mensing, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11).  The Medicaid anti-lien provision prohibits a State from making a claim to any part of a Medicaid beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery not \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated as payments for medical care.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ahlborn, supra, at 284.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s statute, therefore, is pre-empted if, and insofar as, it would operate that way.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd it is pre-empted for that reason.  The defect in \xc2\xa7108A\xe2\x80\x9357 is that it sets forth no process for determining what portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.  Instead, North Carolina has picked an arbitrary number\xe2\x80\x94one-third\xe2\x80\x94and by statutory command labeled that portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery as representing payment for medical care.  Pre-emption is not a matter of semantics.  A State may not evade the pre-emptive force of federal law by resorting to creative statutory interpretation or description at odds with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s intended operation and effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA similar issue was presented last Term, in National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012).  That case involved the pre-emptive scope of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7601 et\xc2\xa0seq.  The Act prohibited States from imposing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[r]equirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to premises, facilities and operations\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d at federally regulated slaughterhouses.  National Meat Assn., 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting \xc2\xa7678).  The State of California had enacted a law that prohibited slaughterhouses from (among other things) selling meat from nonambulatory ani- mals for human consumption.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (citing Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7599f(b) (West 2010)).  California sought to defend the law on the ground that it did not regulate the activities of slaughterhouses but instead restricted what type of meat could be sold in the marketplace after the animals had been butchered.  565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court rejected that argument.  It recognized that if the argument were to prevail, \xe2\x80\x9cthen any State could im-pose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the State disapproved.  That would make a mockery of the [Act\xe2\x80\x99s] preemption provision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  In a pre-emption case, the Court held, a proper analysis requires consideration of what the state law in fact does, not how the litigant might choose to describe it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat reasoning controls here.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s argument, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the context of tort recoveries.  The argument lacks any limiting principle: If a State arbitrarily may designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medical expenses, there is no logical reason why it could not designate half, three-quarters, or all of a tort recovery in the same way.  In Ahlborn, the State of Arkansas, under this rationale, would have succeeded in claiming the full amount it sought from the beneficiary had it been more creative and less candid in describing the effect of its full-reimbursement law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere the State concedes that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to defend\xe2\x80\x9d a law purporting to allocate most or all of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery to medical expenses.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 20.  That is true; but, as a doctrinal matter, it is no eas- ier to defend North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s across-the-board allocation of one-third of all beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 tort recoveries to medical ex-penses.  The problem is not that it is an unreasonable ap-proximation in all cases.  In some cases, it may well be a fair estimate.  But the State provides no evidence to substantiate its claim that the one-third allocation is reasonable in the mine run of cases.  Nor does the law provide a mechanism for determining whether it is a reasonable approximation in any particular case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn some instances, no estimate will be necessary or appropriate.  When there has been a judicial finding or approval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical damages\xe2\x80\x94in the form of either a jury verdict, court decree, or stipulation binding on all parties\xe2\x80\x94that is the end of the matter.  Ahlborn was a case of this sort.  All parties (including the State of Arkansas) stipulated that approximately 6 percent of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s settlement represented payment for medical costs.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 274.  In other cases a settlement may not be reached and the judge or jury, in its findings, may make an allocation.  With a stipulation or judgment under this procedure, the anti-lien provision protects from state demand the portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery that the stipulation or judgment does not attribute to medical expenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNorth Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s statute, however, operates to allow the State to take one-third of the total recovery, even if a proper stipulation or judgment attributes a smaller percentage to medical expenses.  Consider the facts of Ahlborn.  There, only $35,581.47 of the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s settlement \xe2\x80\x9cconstituted reimbursement for medical payments made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s statute, had it been applied in Ahlborn, would have allowed the State to claim $183,333.33 (one-third of the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s $550,000 settlement).  A conflict thus exists between North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law and the Medicaid anti-lien provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe instant case, to be sure, is not quite so clear cut; for there was no allocation of the settlement by either judi- cial decree or binding stipulation of the parties.  But the reasoning of Ahlborn and the design of the federal statute contemplate that possibility.  When the State and the beneficiary are unable to agree on an allocation, Ahlborn noted, the parties could \xe2\x80\x9csubmi[t] the matter to a court for decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 288.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe facts of the present case demonstrate why Ahlborn anticipated that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary in that situation.  Of the damages stemming from the injuries E. M.\xc2\xa0A. suffered at birth, it is apparent that a quite substantial share must be allocated to the skilled home care she will require for the rest of her life.  See App. 112.  It also may be necessary to consider how much E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents could have expected to receive as compensation for their other tort claims had the suit proceeded to trial.  An irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid Act\xe2\x80\x99s clear mandate that a State may not demand any por- tion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical expenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNorth Carolina offers responses to this reasoning, but none is persuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the State asserts that it is doing nothing more than what Ahlborn said it could do: \xe2\x80\x9cadop[t] special rules and procedures for allocating tort settlements.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 288, n.\xc2\xa018.  This misreads Ahlborn.  There the Court, citing an amicus brief, referred to judicial proceedings some States had established for allocating tort settlements where necessary for insurance or tax purposes.  See Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of America, O. T. 2005, No. 04\xe2\x80\x931506, pp. 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (citing Henning v. Wineman, 306 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 550 (Minn. 1981), and Rimes v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 106 Wis. 2d 263, 316 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 348 (1982)).  Those examples illustrated the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cspecial rules and procedures for allocating tort settlements\xe2\x80\x9d that Ahlborn con- sidered.  The decision did not endorse irrebuttable presumptions that designate some arbitrary fraction of a tort judgment to medical expenses in all cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, North Carolina contends that its law falls within the scope of a State\xe2\x80\x99s traditional authority to regulate tort actions, including the amount of damages that a party may recover.  This argument begins from a correct premise: In our federal system, there is no question that States possess the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional authority to provide tort remedies to their citizens\xe2\x80\x9d as they see fit.  Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., \n\n464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 238, \n248 (1984)\n.  But North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law is not an exercise of the State\xe2\x80\x99s general authority to regulate its tort system.  It does not limit tort plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to recover for certain types of nonmedical damages, and it does not say that medical damages are to be privileged above other damages in tort suits.  All it seeks to do is to allocate the share of damages attributable to medical expenses in tort suits brought by Medicaid beneficiaries.  A statute that singles out Medicaid beneficiaries in this manner cannot avoid compliance with the federal anti-lien provision merely by relying upon a connection to an area of traditional state regulation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, North Carolina suggests that even though its allocation of one-third of a tort recovery to medical expenses may be arbitrary, other methods for allocating a recovery would be just as arbitrary.  In the State\xe2\x80\x99s view there is no \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable \xe2\x80\x98true value\xe2\x80\x99 of [a] case that should control what portion of any settlement is subject to the State\xe2\x80\x99s third-party recovery rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  As explained earlier, allocations, while to some extent perhaps not precise, need not be arbitrary.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  In some cases a judgment or stipulation binding on all parties will allocate the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s recovery across different claims.  Where no such judgment or stipulation exists, a fair allocation of such a settlement may be difficult to determine.  Trial judges and trial lawyers, however, can find objective benchmarks to make projections of the damages the plaintiff likely could have proved had the case gone to trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the instant case, for example, the North Carolina trial court approved the settlement only after finding that it constituted \xe2\x80\x9cfair and just compensation\xe2\x80\x9d to E. M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents for her \xe2\x80\x9csevere and debilitating injuries\xe2\x80\x9d; for \xe2\x80\x9cmedical and life care expenses\xe2\x80\x9d her condition will require; and for \xe2\x80\x9csevere emotional distress\xe2\x80\x9d from her injuries.  App. 82.  What portion of this lump-sum settlement constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cfair and just compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for each individual claim will depend both on how likely E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents would have been to prevail on the claims at trial and how much they reasonably could have expected to receive on each claim if successful, in view of damages awarded in comparable tort cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis relates to North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s fourth argument: that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cwasteful, time consuming, and costly\xe2\x80\x9d to hold \xe2\x80\x9cfrequent mini-trials\xe2\x80\x9d in order to divide a settlement between medical and nonmedical expenses.  Brief for Petitioner 28.  Even if that were true, it would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the terms of the Medicaid anti-lien provision.  And it is not true as a general proposition.  States have considerable latitude to design administrative and judicial procedures to ensure a prompt and fair allocation of damages.  Sixteen States and the District of Columbia provide for hearings of this sort, and there is no indication that they have proved bur- densome.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28\xe2\x80\x93 29, and n.\xc2\xa07.  See, e.g., Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code Ann. \xc2\xa714124.76(a) (West 2011); Mo. Rev.

Many of these States have established rebuttable presumptions and adjusted burdens of proof to ensure that speculative assessments of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s likely recovery do not defeat the State\xe2\x80\x99s right to recover medical costs, a concern North Carolina raises.  See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7346\xe2\x80\x9337(h) (2011 Cum. Supp.) (rebuttable presumption of a one-third allocation); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 118E, \xc2\xa722(c) (West 2010) (rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement); Okla. Stat., Tit. 63, \xc2\xa75051.1(D)(1)(d) (West 2011) (rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement, \xe2\x80\x9cunless a more limited allocation of damages to medical expenses is shown by clear and convincing evidence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Without holding that these rules are necessarily compliant with the federal statute, it can be concluded that they are more accurate than the procedure North Carolina has enacted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe task of dividing a tort settlement is a familiar one. In a variety of settings, state and federal courts are called upon to separate lump-sum settlements or jury awards into categories to satisfy different claims to a portion of the moneys recovered.  See supra, at 11.  See also, e.g., Green v. Commissioner, 507 F.\xc2\xa03d 857, 867\xe2\x80\x93868 (CA5 2007) (separation of compensatory from noncompensatory damages for tax purposes); Donnel v.

North Star Drilling Co., 552 So. 2d 673, 685 (La. App. 1989) (separation of past dam- ages from future damages for purposes of calculating pre- judgment interest).  Indeed, North Carolina itself uses a judicial allocation procedure to ascertain the portion of a settlement subject to subrogation in a workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation suit.  It instructs trial courts to\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cconsider the anticipated amount of prospective compensation the employer or workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation carrier is likely to pay to the employee in the future, the net recovery to plaintiff, the likelihood of the plaintiff prevailing at trial or on appeal, the need for finality in the litigation, and any other factors the court deems just and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0C.

It might also consider a different one along the lines of what other States have done in Medicaid reimbursement cases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State thus has ample means available to allocate Medicaid beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 tort recoveries in an efficient manner that complies with federal law.  Indeed, if States are concerned that case-by-case judicial allocations will prove unwieldy, they may even be able to adopt ex ante administrative criteria for allocating medical and nonmedical expenses, provided that these criteria are backed by evidence suggesting that they are likely to yield reasonable results in the mine run of cases.

The statute is silent on the question.  It simply says that a State may recover the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cpayment\xe2\x80\x9d that the State has made on behalf of the victim \xe2\x80\x9cfor medical assistance for health care items or services\xe2\x80\x9d from funds that \xe2\x80\x9cany other party\xe2\x80\x9d has paid \xe2\x80\x9cfor such health care items or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(H).  Moreover, the question focuses upon a comparatively minor matter of statutory detail, not a major issue of far-reaching statutory policy.  It concerns everyday administration.  It calls for expertise of a kind that the administering agency is more likely than a court to possess.  And any of several different answers to the question would seem reasonable.  Under these circumstances, normally we should find that Congress delegated to the agency authority to fill the statutory gap, and we should uphold the agency\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion as long as it is reasonable.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837, \n844 (1984)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, however, the agency did not engage in rulemaking procedures, it did not carefully consider differing points of view of those affected, it did not set forth its views in a manual intended for widespread use, nor has it in any other way announced an interpretation that Congress would have \xe2\x80\x9cintended .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to carry the force of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n221 (2001)\n.  Indeed, the agency does not claim that it exercised any dele- gated legislative power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNeither do the documents in which the agency set forth its position (a memorandum and a letter) have much \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98power to persuade.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Christensen v.

And the conclusion now advanced by the agency represents a radical departure from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s previous position.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a, 141a\xe2\x80\x93142a.  Thus, the Solicitor General does not ask us to defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views\xe2\x80\x94and understandably so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNonetheless, the Administrative Procedure Act is not the tax code.  And cases that seek to determine whether Congress intended courts to give weight to agency views provide rules of thumb, general principles meant to guide interpretation, not rigid rules that narrowly confine it.  They seek to advance Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent as embodied in particular statutory schemes by helping courts to determine whether, and how, Congress intended those courts to respect an agency\xe2\x80\x99s expertise when reasonably exercised in particular cases.  They seek to allocate the law-interpreting function between court and agency in a way likely to work best within any particular statutory scheme.  But they do not purport to do more than that.  In particular, they do not set forth all-encompassing absolute rules, impervious to nuance and admitting of no exceptions.  Felix Frankfurter\xe2\x80\x99s observation, made many years ago, remains valid today: \xe2\x80\x9cThe problems subsumed by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98administrative discretion\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must be related to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the particular interest .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as to which \xe2\x80\x98administrative discretion\xe2\x80\x99 is exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Task of Administrative Law, 75 U.\xc2\xa0Pa.

See generally Eskridge &amp; Baer, The Continuum of Deference: Supreme Court Treatment of Agency Statutory Interpretations from Chevron to Ham- dan, 96 Geo. L.\xc2\xa0J. 1083 (2008).

But it is still worth noting that the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination has played some role in my own decision.  That is because the agency, after looking into the matter more thoroughly (perhaps after notice-and-comment rulemaking), might change its mind.  Given the nature of the question and of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s expertise, courts, I believe, should then give weight to that new and different agency decision.  Cf. National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 967\n\xe2\x80\x93986 (2005).

E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. sued those al-leged to have caused her injuries, eventually settling for an amount that included, among other things, medical expenses already covered by North Carolina.  The federal Medicaid statute requires North Carolina to recoup those expenses.  But neither the Act nor the regulations issued under it tell States how to determine what portion of a third-party recovery should be attributed to medical expenses.  The Court concludes that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law addressing that question is nonetheless preempted by the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Act, while plausible, is not compelled by the statutory text or our precedent.  It has the unfortunate consequence of denying flexibility to the States\xe2\x80\x94and, by necessary implication, the Secretary of Health and Human Services\xe2\x80\x94in resolving a policy question with broad significance for this complicated program.

The basic idea is simple: The statute\xe2\x80\x94as interpreted by the Secretary of HHS\xe2\x80\x94sets out the requirements for an eligible Medicaid program.  If States decide to enroll and comply with those requirements, they get federal money.  If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they don\xe2\x80\x99t.  The federal contribution is not enough to fully fund any State\xe2\x80\x99s program; States contribute anywhere from 17 to 50 percent of the costs.  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V).  The States have considerable discretion in structuring and administering their programs, subject of course to federal law and regulations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn practice, it\xe2\x80\x99s not always so simple.  The books are thick with federal regulations that States must interpret and reconcile.  By my count, at least 39 federal-court opinions, including one of our own, have reiterated Judge Friendly\xe2\x80\x99s observation that Medicaid law is \xe2\x80\x9calmost unintelligible to the uninitiated.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Schweiker v.

But where the law and the Secretary are silent on a specific ques-tion, it is up to the States\xe2\x80\x94sometimes informally advised by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medi- caid Services\xe2\x80\x94to make sense of it all in running their programs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe relevant provisions here require that North Caro- lina (1) pay for certain people\xe2\x80\x99s medical care, (2) make reasonable efforts to recoup from liable third parties (such as tortfeasors and insurers) any medical expenses it paid, and (3) not recoup such payments by imposing a lien on the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s property.  See ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935; see also \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396a(a)(25)(B) (2006 ed.).  To comply, North Carolina pays for a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s medical expenses on the condition that any such expenses the beneficiary recovers from third parties will go towards repaying the State.  See N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat.

Take this case: E.\xc2\xa0M.\xc2\xa0A. and her parents sought damages not only for medical expenses, but for lost income, pain and suffering, and other things, and ended up settling all these claims for a lump sum of $2.8 million.  Such a situation poses the question of how much North Carolina can recoup\xe2\x80\x94indeed, under federal law, must recoup\xe2\x80\x94from a lump sum that reflects more than just medical expenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis puts North Carolina in a tight spot.  If it fails to recover what it must, it violates federal law.  If it takes a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s property beyond medical expenses, it violates federal law.  Trying to navigate between these competing requirements\xe2\x80\x94with no interpretive guidance from the Secretary of HHS\xe2\x80\x94North Carolina elected to resolve the problem by laying out ground rules in advance, conditioning a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s right to recover from third parties on the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to fully repay the State, or, at a minimum, define one-third of her damages as \xe2\x80\x9cmedical expenses,\xe2\x80\x9d whichever is less.

The federal statute, which provides that States must recoup medical expenses owed by third parties, and which prevents States from placing a lien on a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s property, says nothing about how to comply with these two requirements in the event of a settlement.

There, the underlying tort suit settled for $550,000, and the Medicaid beneficiary and the State of Arkansas stipulated that only $35,581.47 of the settlement represented medical expenses.  The State nonetheless claimed it \xe2\x80\x9cwas entitled to a lien in the amount of $215,645.30\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the total amount paid by the State for the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s health care.  Id., at 274.  The question was whether the State could demand this money in light of its stipulation that only $35,581.47 reflected medical expenses.  The answer, of course, was no.  The State is only entitled to recover medical expenses; nothing else.  So when Arkansas contended that it was entitled to money the beneficiary had received for something other than medical expenses, we had no trouble rejecting that argument.  That proposition\xe2\x80\x94that States may not take money that is unrelated to medical expenses\xe2\x80\x94does not help answer the question here: May a State condition Medicaid benefits on a beneficiary agreeing to define one-third of a tort recovery as reflecting \xe2\x80\x9cmedical expenses\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court recognizes that Ahlborn \xe2\x80\x9chad no occasion to resolve\xe2\x80\x9d the question \xe2\x80\x9chow to determine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical care,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 5, but then promptly proceeds as if Ahlborn had done just that.  The Court quotes Ahlborn for the proposition that a State may not claim any portion of a tort recovery \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98designated as payments for medical care,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and then faults North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law because it \xe2\x80\x9csets forth no process for determining what portion\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cattributable to med-ical expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6, 7 (quoting 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 284), 7.  Ahlborn spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated\xe2\x80\x9d amounts because, as noted, there was a stipulated designation in that case.  What to do when there is no such stipulation\xe2\x80\x94when it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear \xe2\x80\x9cwhat portion of a settlement represents payment for medical care\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a different question.  The Court assumes the answer must be the same: that the settlement must be parsed in every case, so that there is an actual, after-the-fact designation in every case.  If the parties do not agree on one, as they did in Ahlborn, there must be a process in place for reaching a case-specific attribution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe nature of the \xe2\x80\x9cprocess\xe2\x80\x9d contemplated by the major- ity is unclear, but it must involve an effort to determine what claims would have succeeded had there been a trial, what the damages would have been for the separate claims, and so on\xe2\x80\x94the very sort of inquiries settlement is intended to obviate.  The Court talks of addressing these concerns through \xe2\x80\x9crebuttable presumptions and adjusted burdens of proof to ensure that speculative assessments of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s likely recovery do not defeat the State\xe2\x80\x99s right to recover medical costs,\xe2\x80\x9d but ominously declines to give any assurance \xe2\x80\x9cthat these rules are necessarily compliant with the federal statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing in Ahlborn requires all this, and North Caro-lina has taken a different approach.  It has adjusted its tort law to account for its obligations under federal Medicaid law by requiring that beneficiaries pay the State back in full or designate one-third of any recovery as \xe2\x80\x9cmedical ex-penses,\xe2\x80\x9d whichever is less.  This approach allows bene-ficiaries to obtain settlements, \xe2\x80\x9cmeet[s] concerns about settlement manipulation,\xe2\x80\x9d Ahlborn, supra, at 288, n.\xc2\xa018, complies with the statutory obligation that States make reasonable efforts to recover medical expenses from liable third parties, and guarantees that the beneficiary will never have to give back more than she has already received from the State.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing unusual about such an approach.  States define the contours of their own tort law all the time, setting rules about who may recover in particular circumstances, what claims may be alleged, which parties are liable, what defenses may be asserted, what damages are recoverable, and so on.  Doing so does not amount to imposing a lien on any property to which an individual has a vested right under state tort law.  The Court says North Carolina cannot rely on its \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional authority to regulate tort actions\xe2\x80\x9d because its rule in this case is not an exercise of its \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 11.  The Court cites no support for this vague new limitation on a State\xe2\x80\x99s power to define tort remedies under state law, and I am aware of none.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fact, federal law says nothing about how States must define the recovery available to a Medicaid beneficiary suing a third party.  That silence is a good indication that Congress did not mean to strip States of their traditional authority to regulate torts.  See Wyeth v. Levine, \n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, \n565 (2009)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has legislated in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted)).  The closest the Medicaid Act gets to this topic is its requirement that States have \xe2\x80\x9cin effect laws under which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71396(a)(25)(H).  That Congress has said nothing else about what recovery a State must allow, though clearly aware of the traditional power of States to regulate recoveries under private law, should be worth something.  Cf. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141\n\xe2\x80\x93167 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority nonetheless dismisses North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s solution as an arbitrary \xe2\x80\x9cone-size-fits-all\xe2\x80\x9d approach, ante, at 10, that has no \xe2\x80\x9clogical\xe2\x80\x9d endpoint; one that, if accepted, could permit States to \xe2\x80\x9cdesignate half, three-quarters, or all of a tort recovery in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8, 9.  This is an age-old objection to any line-drawing, to which Justice Holmes provided a familiar response: \xe2\x80\x9cNeither are we troubled by the question where to draw the line.  That is the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Irwin v. Gavit, \n\n268 U.\xc2\xa0S. 161, \n168 (1925)\n.  Whatever the case \xe2\x80\x9cas a doctrinal matter,\xe2\x80\x9d it is in fact \xe2\x80\x9ceasier to defend North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d one-third designation than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical where a State allocates all of a recovery to medical expenses.  Ante, at 9.  In addition, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s hobgoblin is less frightening when we remember that North Carolina never takes back more than what it paid for such expenses.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reasons for drawing a bright line, as North Carolina has, are obvious and familiar.  See generally Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1175 (1989).  Bright lines provide clear notice; here that means beneficiaries know exactly where they stand with respect to reimbursing the State as they negotiate settlements with third parties.  Such clear rules are easy, cheap, and administrable\xe2\x80\x94laudable qualities in the context of a vast and intricate program.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, on the other end, requires the time of lawyers and judges, and that time costs money\xe2\x80\x94money better spent on providing health care to the needy.  Or so the State, responsible for administering its program, could conclude, and nothing in the statute, regulations, or our precedent says otherwise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority points out that nearly one-third of the States conduct hearings of the sort it contemplates.  Ante, at 13.  Good for them.  The whole point of our federal system is that different States may reach different judgments about how to run their own different programs.  Such flexibility is particularly important in this context, where Medicaid spending is the largest component of most state budgets.  The Court also notes that, in other areas, courts have undertaken the work of \xe2\x80\x9cseparat[ing] lump-sum settlements or jury awards into categories to satisfy different claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  My point is not that the work required by the Court cannot be done\xe2\x80\x94just that it has not been required by Congress or the Secretary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn that note, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough that the Court finds the State\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable effort to reconcile its competing obligations preempted.  What is doubly unfortunate is that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis necessarily implies that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s hands are also tied.  The Medicaid Act is Spending Clause legislation, and such legislation is binding on States only insofar as it is \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, \n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n17 (1981)\n.  In addition, the anti-lien provision only precludes North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law if, as the Court acknowledges, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect conflict\xe2\x80\x9d between the two.  Ante, at 7 (quoting PLIVA, Inc., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court says\xe2\x80\x94wrongly, I believe\xe2\x80\x94that there is.  Ante, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cAn irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid Act\xe2\x80\x99s clear mandate that a State may not demand any portion of a beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical expenses\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  But if North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s approach directly conflicts with an unambiguous, clear mandate in the Act\xe2\x80\x94such that any presumption against preemption is overcome, see Wyeth, supra, at 565, n.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how the Secretary could adopt a similar approach.  See Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93843 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe concurrence wishes this were not so, see ante, at 4 (\xe2\x80\x9ctoday\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not freeze the Court\xe2\x80\x99s present interpretation of the statute permanently into law\xe2\x80\x9d), but fails to acknowledge the express rationale of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.

In exactly two sentences, the Court seems to falter and lose the courage of its conviction that a State must have a process in place for an individual allocation of medical expenses in every case.  The Court views the problem with North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law as being that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State provides no evidence to substantiate its claim that the one-third allocation is reasonable in the mine run of  cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.  That thought does not resurface until five pages later\xe2\x80\x94and only then\xe2\x80\x94when the Court says that States \xe2\x80\x9cmay even be able to adopt ex ante administrative criteria for allocating medical and nonmedical expenses, provided these criteria are backed by evidence suggesting that they are likely to yield reasonable results in the mine run of cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 14.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI am not sure whether this is a concession \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tthat individualized hearings may not be required after all, but if it is, it is flatly contrary to the rest of the opinion.  It is also quite odd to suggest that the problem with North Caro-lina\xe2\x80\x99s law would go away if only the State provided some sort of study substantiating the idea that one-third was a good approximation in most cases.  North Carolina is not a federal agency, whose actions are subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d test.  See \n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2)(E).  We have never before, in a preemption case, put the burden on the State to compile an evidentiary record supporting its legislative determination.  The burden is, of course, on those challenging the law.  See Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644\n\xe2\x80\x93662 (2003) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe start .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with a presumption that the state statute is valid, and ask whether petitioner has shouldered the burden of overcoming that presumption\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  We have said that, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress is not obligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record of the type that an administrative agency or court does to accommodate judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180, \n213 (1997)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).

It is hard enough to figure out what the Medicaid Act means by what it says; we should not read so much into its silence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUltimately, it is a basic policy judgment whether the Medicaid program is best served in this instance by post\xc2\xa0hoc individualized determinations, or whether the issue may be addressed in advance, through a general rule, as North Carolina has done here.  See ante, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cany of several different answers to the question would seem reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court can point to nothing that delegates to it the prerogative to make that judgment.  Rather, States and the Secretary\xe2\x80\x94working together\xe2\x80\x94should be afforded the leeway to make their joint venture a workable one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law does not conflict with federal law, I would let it be.
