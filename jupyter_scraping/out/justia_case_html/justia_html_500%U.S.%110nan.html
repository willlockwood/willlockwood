[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  More narrowly, the question is whether, at the time of petitioner\'s sentencing hearing, he and his counsel had adequate notice that the judge might sentence him to death.</p>\n<p>The unique circumstance that gives rise to concern about the adequacy of the notice in this case is the fact that, pursuant to court order, the prosecutor had formally advised the trial judge and the petitioner that the State would not recommend the death penalty.  To place this circumstance in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 500 U. S. 112</a></p><p> proper perspective, it is necessary to relate the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On or about June 21, 1983, Robert and Cheryl Bravence were killed at their campsite near Santiam Creek, Idaho.  On December 1, 1983, the State filed an information charging petitioner with the crime of first-degree murder.  The first count alleged that Robert Bravence had been beaten to death and the second count alleged that Cheryl Bravence had been killed in the same way.  Identical charges were also filed against petitioner\'s older brother, Mark.  At the arraignment, the trial judge advised petitioner that "the maximum punishment that you may receive if you are convicted on either of the two charges is imprisonment for life or death."  App. 14.</p>\n<p>After the arraignment, petitioner\'s appointed counsel entered into plea negotiations with the prosecutor.  During these negotiations, petitioner agreed to take two lie-detector tests.  Although the results of the tests were not entirely satisfactory, they convinced the prosecutor that petitioner\'s older brother Mark was primarily responsible for the crimes, and was the actual killer of both victims.  <em>Id.</em> at 193.  The parties agreed on an indeterminate sentence with a 1-year minimum in exchange for a guilty plea, subject to a commitment from the trial judge that he would impose that sentence.  In February, 1984, the judge refused to make that commitment.  In March, the case went to trial.  The State proved that petitioner and his brother Mark decided to steal their victims\' Volkswagen van.  Petitioner walked into the Bravences\' campsite armed with a shotgun and engaged them in conversation.  When Cheryl left and went to a nearby creek, Mark entered the campsite, ordered Robert to kneel down, and struck him on the head with a nightstick.  When Cheryl returned, Mark gave her the same order, and killed her in the same manner.  <em>See State v. Lankford,</em> 113 Idaho 688, 691, 747 P.2d 710, 713 (1987). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 500 U. S. 113</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner testified in support of a defense theory that he was only an accessory after the fact. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The jury was instructed, however, that evidence that petitioner "was present, and that he aided and abetted in the commission of the crime of robbery" was sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree murder.  App. 16. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The trial judge refused </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 500 U. S. 114</a></p><p> to instruct the jury that a specific intent to kill was required. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The jury found petitioner guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p>At the prosecutor\'s request, the sentencing hearing was postponed until after the separate trial of petitioner\'s brother was concluded.  The sentencing was first set for June 28, 1984, and later reset for October, 1984.  In the interim, pursuant to petitioner\'s request, on September 6, 1984, the trial court entered an order requiring the State to notify the court and the petitioner whether it would ask for the death penalty, and if so, to file a statement of the aggravating circumstances on which it intended to rely. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  A week later, the State filed this negative response:</p>\n<p>"COMES NOW, Dennis L. Albers, in relation to the Court\'s Order of September 6, 1984, and makes the following response."</p>\n<p>"In relation to the above-named defendant, Bryan Stuart Lankford, the State through the Prosecuting Attorney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 500 U. S. 115</a></p><p> <em>will not</em> be recommending the death penalty as to either count of first degree murder for which the defendant was earlier convicted."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 26 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>In the following month, there was a flurry of activity.  The trial court granted petitioner\'s <em>pro se</em> request for a new lawyer, denied that lawyer\'s motion for a new trial based on the alleged incompetence of trial counsel, denied a motion for a continuance of the sentencing hearing, and denied the new lawyer\'s request for a typewritten copy of the trial transcript. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In none of these proceedings was there any mention of the possibility that petitioner might receive a death sentence. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 500 U. S. 116</a></p><p></p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing on October 12, 1984, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] there was no discussion of the death penalty as a possible sentence.  The prosecutor offered no evidence.  He relied on the trial record, explained why he had not recommended the death penalty, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and ultimately recommended an indeterminate life sentence with a minimum of "somewhere between ten and 20 years."  <em>Id.</em> at 104.  The defense put on a number of witnesses who testified that petitioner was a nonviolent person, but that he was subject to domination by his brother Mark, who had violent and dangerous propensities.  <em>Id.</em> at 997.  In her argument in mitigation, defense counsel stressed these facts, as well as the independent evidence that Mark was the actual killer.  She urged the Court to impose concurrent, indeterminate life sentences, which would make petitioner eligible for parole in 10 years, less the time he had already served.  She argued against consecutive indeterminate sentences which would have amounted to a 20-year term, or a fixed-life term that would have amounted to a 40-year minimum.  She made no reference to a possible death sentence.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge made a rather lengthy statement in which he indicated that he considered petitioner\'s testimony unworthy of belief and that the seriousness of the crime warranted more severe punishment than that which the State had recommended.  <em>Id.</em> at 114-118.  At the beginning of this lengthy statement, he described the options available to the court, including the indeterminate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 500 U. S. 117</a></p><p> life sentence recommended by the State,</p>\n<p>"or a fixed life sentence for a period of time greater than the number of years he would serve on an indeterminate life sentence, <em>i.e.,</em> ten.  For example, a fixed term of 40 years or death or a fixed life sentence. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 114.  He concluded by saying that he would announce his decision on the following Monday.</p>\n<p>On that Monday, the trial judge spent the entire day conducting the sentencing hearing in Mark\'s case.  At 9:38 p.m., he reconvened petitioner\'s sentencing hearing.  After a preliminary colloquy, he read his written findings and sentenced petitioner to death.  These findings, some of which were repeated almost verbatim in his later order sentencing Mark to death, repeatedly reflected the judge\'s opinion that the two brothers were equally culpable. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 500 U. S. 118</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner sought postconviction relief on a variety of grounds, including a claim that the trial court violated the Constitution by failing to give notice of its intention to impose the death sentence in spite of the State\'s notice that it was not seeking the death penalty.  <em>Id.</em> at 168.  The trial court held that the Idaho Code provided petitioner with sufficient notice, and that the prosecutor\'s statement that he did not intend to seek the death penalty had "no bearing on the adequacy of notice to petitioner that the death penalty might be imposed."  <em>Id.</em> at 200.  Petitioner\'s request for relief on this claim was therefore denied.  <em>Id.</em> at 201.</p>\n<p>In a consolidated appeal, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed petitioner\'s conviction and sentence and also affirmed the denial of postconviction relief.  On the notice issue, the Court concluded that the express advice given to petitioner at his arraignment, together with the terms of the statute, were sufficient.  <em>State v. Lankford,</em> 113 Idaho at 697, 747 P.2d at 719.</p>\n<p>One Justice dissented from the affirmance of petitioner\'s sentence.  <em>Id.</em> at 705, 747 P.2d at 727.  Relying on the absence of any contention that petitioner struck any of the fatal blows, and the fact that the evidence concerning petitioner\'s intent was equivocal, he concluded that the sentence was invalid under our decisions in <em>Enmund v. Florida</em> [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and <em>Tison v. Arizona,</em> [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] as well as under the Idaho cases that the majority had considered in its proportionality review. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 500 U. S. 119</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Idaho Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>Satterwhite v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/249/case.html">486 U. S. 249</a></span> (1988); 486 U.S. 1051 (1988).  On remand, by a vote of 3 to 2, the court reinstated its earlier judgment.  116 Idaho 279, 775 P.2d 593 (1989).  We again granted certiorari, 498 U.S. 919 (1990), to consider the question raised by the trial court\'s order concerning the death penalty and the State\'s response thereto.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Before discussing the narrow legal issue raised by the special presentencing order and the State\'s response, it is useful to put to one side certain propositions that are not in dispute in this case.  As a matter of substantive Idaho law, the trial judge\'s power to impose a sentence that is authorized by statute is not limited by a prosecutor\'s recommendation.  Thus, petitioner does not argue that the State made a formal waiver that limited the trial judge\'s authority to impose the death sentence.  The issue is one of adequate procedure, rather than of substantive power.  Conversely, the State does not argue that a sentencing hearing would be fair if the defendant and his counsel did not receive adequate notice that he might be sentenced to death.  The State\'s argument is that the terms of the statute, plus the advice received at petitioner\'s arraignment, provided such notice.  This argument would plainly be correct if there had not been a presentencing order, or if similar advice had been given after petitioner received the State\'s negative response and before the sentencing hearing commenced.</p>\n<p>As a factual matter, it is also undisputed that the character of the sentencing proceeding did not provide the petitioner with any indication that the trial judge contemplated death as a possible sentence.  A hearing to decide whether the sentences should be indeterminate or fixed, whether they should run concurrently or consecutively, and what period of imprisonment was appropriate, would have proceeded in exactly the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 500 U. S. 120</a></p><p> same way as this hearing did.  Indeed, it is apparent that the parties assumed that nothing more was at stake.  There is nothing in the record after the State\'s response to the presentencing order and before the trial judge\'s remark at the end of the hearing that mentioned the possibility of a capital sentence.  During the hearing, while both defense counsel and the prosecutor were arguing the merits of concurrent or consecutive, and fixed or indeterminate, terms, the silent judge was the only person in the courtroom who knew that the real issue that they should have been debating was the choice between life or death.</p>\n<p>The presentencing order entered by the trial court requiring the State to advise the court and the defendant whether it sought the death penalty, and if so, requiring the parties to specify the aggravating and mitigating circumstances on which they intended to rely, was comparable to a pretrial order limiting the issues to be tried.  The purpose of such orders is to eliminate the need to address matters that are not in dispute, and thereby to save the valuable time of judges and lawyers.  For example, if the State had responded in the affirmative and indicated an intention to rely on only three aggravating circumstances, the defense could reasonably have assumed that the evidence to be adduced would relate only to those three circumstances, and therefore, the defense could have limited its preparation accordingly.  Similarly, in this case, it was surely reasonable for the defense to assume that there was no reason to present argument or evidence directed at the question whether the death penalty was either appropriate or permissible.  Orders that are designed to limit the issues would serve no purpose if counsel acted at their peril when they complied with the orders\' limitations.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, true that this order did not expressly place any limits on counsel\'s preparation.  The question, however, is whether it can be said that counsel had adequate notice of the critical issue that the judge was actually debating.  Our </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 500 U. S. 121</a></p><p> answer to that question must reflect the importance that we attach to the concept of fair notice as the bedrock of any constitutionally fair procedure.  Justice Frankfurter eloquently made this point in <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/123/case.html">341 U. S. 123</a></span> (1951):</p>\n<p>"Representing a profound attitude of fairness between man and man, and more particularly between the individual and government, \'due process\' is compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions, and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess.  Due process is not a mechanical instrument.  It is not a yardstick.  It is a process.  It is a delicate process of adjustment inescapably involving the exercise of judgment by those whom the Constitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/123/case.html#162">341 U. S. 162</a></span>-163 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p>"The heart of the matter is that democracy implies respect for the elementary rights of men, however suspect or unworthy; a democratic government must therefore practice fairness; and fairness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/123/case.html#170">341 U.

At least such is the conviction underlying our Bill of Rights.  That a conclusion satisfies one\'s private conscience does not attest its reliability.  The validity and moral authority of a conclusion largely depend on the mode by which it was reached.  Secrecy is not congenial to truth-seeking and self-righteousness gives too slender an assurance of rightness.  No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.  Nor has a better way been found for generating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 500 U.

Three examples will suffice to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p>One of the arguments that petitioner\'s counsel could have raised had she known the death penalty was still at issue pertained to a concern voiced by the dissenting Justice in the Idaho Supreme Court, who was troubled by the question whether Bryan Lankford\'s level of participation met the standard described in <em>Enmund v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/case.html">458 U. S. 782</a></span> (1982), <em>Tison v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/137/case.html">481 U. S. 137</a></span> (1987), and several Idaho cases. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The dissenting Justice described the majority\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="123">Page 500 U. S. 123</a></p><p> opinion as having mischaracterized the trial court\'s findings as to Bryan Lankford\'s state of mind.  <em>State v. Lankford,</em> 113 Idaho 688, 706, 747 P.2d 710, 728 (1987).  The factual dispute over the record, combined with the dissenting Justice\'s reliance on Idaho cases, demonstrates that petitioner failed to make an argument that, at least as a matter of state law, might have influenced the trial judge\'s deliberations.  There was, however, no point in making such an argument if the death penalty was not at issue.</p>\n<p>One of the aggravating circumstances that the trial judge found as a basis for his sentence was that the "murders of the Bravences were especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, and manifested exceptional depravity."  App. 156-157.  Even if petitioner had been the actual killer, it is at least arguable that the evidence was insufficient to support this finding. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  If petitioner was not the actual killer, this finding was even more questionable.  The point, however, is that petitioner\'s counsel had no way of knowing that the court was even considering such a finding, and therefore she did not discuss that possibility at the sentencing hearing.  It is unrealistic to assume that the notice provided by the statute and the arraignment survived the State\'s response to an order that would have no purpose other than to limit the issues in future proceedings.</p>\n<p>In view of the fact that the trial Judge\'s sentence appears to rest largely on his disbelief of petitioner\'s testimony [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="124">Page 500 U. S. 124</a></p><p> consequent conclusion that he was just as culpable as his brother, the omission of certain factual evidence takes on special significance.  In her postconviction motion, petitioner\'s counsel represented that the results of two polygraph examinations demonstrated that petitioner was truthful in his testimony concerning "his lack of participation in, or knowledge of, the killings."  App. 170.  Such evidence is inadmissible in Idaho in an ordinary case, and therefore, appropriately, was not offered at the sentencing hearing.

Bryan does stand, then, convicted of two counts of first degree murder for his participation.  I tend to generally believe the witnesses from Texas, the family members, and I have believed this for a long time:  that Bryan has traditionally been a pretty good person, except when he\'s been around Mark.

The state has suggested that the Court consider letting those sentences run concurrently or together at the same time.  I think one first must analyze what that would mean in this case.  That sentence would result in Bryan Lankford being eligible for parole in less than ten years, considering the fact that he\'s served a considerable amount of time in the County Jail.  In view of the recommendation or suggestion that I run the two sentences concurrently, the recommendation would be, in essence, that this Court sentence Bryan Lankford to spend, from this day, less than five years in the penitentiary for the murder of each one of the two Bravences, whose names have not yet been spoken today."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 114-115.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>"This court does not know how many blows were struck by Bryan Lankford or how many blows were struck by Mark Lankford.

Do you understand . . . ?"</p>\n<p>7 Record 15.  Lankford stated that he did.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Court\'s theory is that the unquestionable constitutional adequacy of this notice was destroyed by the judge\'s later order that the State indicate its intentions with regard to sentencing and the prosecutor\'s consequent statement that the State would not seek the death penalty.  That theory would perhaps be correct if there was any reasonable basis for Lankford or his counsel to believe that the sentence could not exceed the prosecutor\'s recommendation.  But plainly there was not.</p>\n<p>The Idaho death penalty statute places full responsibility for determining the sentence upon the judge.  It directs that,</p>\n<p>"[w]here <em>the court</em> finds a statutory aggravating circumstance <em>the court shall</em> sentence the defendant to death <em>unless the court</em> finds that mitigating circumstances which may be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 500 U. S. 129</a></p><p> presented outweigh the gravity of any aggravating circumstance."</p>\n<p>Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(c) (1987) (emphasis added).  Moreover, the finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance is not dependent upon any presentation by the prosecution.  Under Idaho law, "[e]vidence admitted at trial shall be considered and need not be repeated at the sentencing hearing."  Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(d).  Anyone familiar with Lankford\'s case and Idaho law should have recognized immediately that the judge would necessarily find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance, for the jury\'s guilty verdict on the two separate murder counts established that, "[a]t the time the murder was committed the defendant also committed another murder," Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(g)(2). [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Thus, the judge would be bound <em>by law, see</em> Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(e), to weigh all mitigating and aggravating circumstances and to impose the death penalty <em>unless</em> the former outweighed the latter.  Moreover, since an aggravating circumstance would necessarily have been found, in the event that Lankford did <em>not</em> receive the death penalty, the court would be required to "detail in writing its reasons" for giving a lesser sentence.  <em>Ibid.</em>  No provision of the Idaho Code suggests that these duties placed upon the judge by \xc2\xa7 19-2515 dissolve upon the State\'s recommending a lower sentence. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 500 U. S. 130</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Not only is Idaho statutory law clear on its face, but Idaho case law confirms it.  In <em>State v. Rossi,</em> 105 Idaho 681, 672 P.2d 249 (App.1983), the defendant claimed an abuse of discretion when the trial court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment twice as long as the prosecutor had recommended.  The Idaho Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p>"Our Supreme Court has . . . held that no prejudicial error resulted from a court\'s refusal to follow the [sentencing] recommendation of the jury.  We hold that a trial court is also not bound by a sentence recommendation made by the state. . . .  <em>The state\'s recommendation to the trial court is purely advisory.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 682, 672 P.2d at 250 (emphasis added).  <em>Rossi</em> was not a capital case, but nothing in any provision of the Idaho Code or in Idaho case law suggests that the rule in capital cases would be any different.  Indeed, in <em>State v. Osborn,</em> 102 Idaho 405, 631 P.2d 187 (1981), the Idaho Supreme Court found no error where a defendant was not informed whether the State would seek the death penalty, because "[w]hether the state would urge the maximum penalty or not was immaterial to the question of adequate notice to appellant that it was possible."  <em>Id.</em> at 413, 631 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<p>The Court nevertheless holds that Lankford reasonably concluded from the judge\'s September 6 order and the State\'s response that the death penalty did not remain an issue.  "The presentencing order," the Court says, ". . . was comparable to a pretrial order limiting the issues to be tried."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/110/case.html#120">500 U. S. 120</a></span>.  To say that is simply to assume the conclusion.  Assuredly, despite the clarity of Idaho law, if the judge explicitly limited the issues to be considered at sentencing, or in some other way indicated that he would not exceed the prosecutor\'s recommendation, Lankford would have a case.  But <em>was</em> it reasonable to view the September 6 order as "a pretrial order limiting the issues to be tried"?  A pretrial order having such preclusive effect is typically entered pursuant to a rule or statute that says it will be preclusive.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 500 U. S. 110</a></p><p> Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 16(e).  When an order is not entered pursuant to such a provision, as was the case here, one would expect the order itself to specify its preclusive effect, if any.  But the present order said only that the prosecutor must state his intentions.  It seems to me that the absolute limit of preclusion even <em>inferable</em> from that order was that the prosecutor, if he did not express the intention to seek the death penalty, would not be permitted to argue for it at the sentencing hearing.  The consequence of that, of course, would be that the death penalty would be less likely to be imposed, since no one would be pressing it upon the judge and defense counsel\'s arguments against it would go unanswered.  But neither explicitly in the order, nor as an inference of the order, nor even as a consequence of an inference, does it appear that the judge would be entirely <em>precluded</em> from imposing the death penalty.  There was simply no basis for thinking that.</p>\n<p>But perhaps it could be argued that, even though the judge was not legally bound by the prosecutor\'s recommendation against the death penalty, his entry of the order indicated he <em>intended</em> (contrary to Idaho law) to be bound, and that he should be held to that indicated intent by a sort of promissory estoppel.  Even as a factual matter, that argument has no support.  If the judge had entered the order on his own initiative, one might think "Why else would he demand to know the State\'s position in advance unless he intended to accept it?"  In fact, however, it was not the judge, but defense counsel, who asked that the State make its intentions clear.</p>\n<p>"MR. LONGETEIG:  I wonder could the court fix a time in which the state would file a notice of its intention in respect to capital punishment.  This would materially, depending on what he does, alter our course of action in this matter."</p>\n<p>"THE COURT:  I don\'t know that there is any provision that the state notify. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 500 U. S. 132</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"MR. LONGETEIG:  I\'m not aware of any either.  I think it would be a matter of the discretion of the court.  But I would request that."</p>\n<p>"THE COURT:  Oh, well, Mr. Albers apparently doesn\'t have any objections to your request.  He\'s indicated that, I think, as soon as he knows for sure what he wants to do, he\'ll tell you."</p>\n<p>"MR. LONGETEIG:  That\'s satisfactory"</p>\n<p>"MR. ALBERS:  And that will certainly be in plenty of time before the sentencing."</p>\n<p>7 Record 55.  Not only did the judge give no indication that <em>he</em> wanted the State\'s recommendation because he would automatically accept it, but, to the contrary, he plainly indicated that, regardless of what the recommendation was, the death penalty <em>would</em> be at issue.  Immediately following the colloquy quoted above, the record continues as follows:</p>\n<p>"THE COURT:  There obviously needs to be inquiry pursuant to 19-2515 as to the statutory aggravating circumstances that may exist regardless whether or not the state intends to pursue the death penalty."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 56.  The reference to a statutory "inquiry" is to Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(d) (1987), which provides that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n all cases <em>in which the death penalty may be imposed,</em> the court shall, after conviction, order a presentence investigation . . . and shall thereafter convene a sentencing hearing for the purpose of hearing all relevant evidence and arguments of counsel in aggravation and mitigation of the offense. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Pursuant to that section, the judge did order a presentence investigation -- a step not required (or even specifically contemplated) by the Code except in death penalty cases.  And the trial judge\'s reference to <em>statutory</em> aggravating circumstances itself shows that the death penalty remained </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 500 U. S. 133</a></p><p> at issue, for only as to that penalty are qualifying aggravating circumstances specifically listed, <em>see</em> Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(g). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In sum, it was clear that the death penalty remained at issue in the sentencing hearing, and there is no basis for the contention that the judge "misled" Lankford to think otherwise.  Since that is so, today\'s decision creates a vast uncertainty in the law.  If defendants are no longer to be held to knowledge of the law, or if their unreasonable expectations are henceforth to be the criteria of the process which is their due, the lawfulness and finality of no conviction or sentence can be assured.  The defense created by the Court today will always be available, its success to be limited by factors we will presumably seek to identify in a series of future cases that will undertake the impossible task of explaining how much ignorance of the law, or how much unreasonableness of expectation, is too much.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court believes, and I have assumed up to this point, that Lankford and his counsel <em>did</em> detrimentally rely upon the State\'s declaration, <em>i.e.,</em> that they did believe, albeit unreasonably, that the death penalty was foreclosed as an option at sentencing.  It is far from clear, however, that that was so, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 500 U. S. 134</a></p><p> and I do not believe that Lankford has carried the burden of establishing it.</p>\n<p>The reality that the death penalty was not foreclosed as a matter of law was so clear -- from the Idaho statutes, from the case law, and even from the judge\'s explicit statement that the death-sentence "inquiry" would have to be held -- that it is difficult to believe counsel thought otherwise.  Counsel clearly did <em>not</em> believe that the prosecutor\'s recommendation established the permissible maximum with regard to a sentence less than death.  For though the prosecutor, who spoke first at the sentencing hearing, recommended the minimum sentence of life imprisonment with possibility of parole in 10 to 20 years, Lankford\'s counsel argued specifically against life imprisonment <em>without possibility of parole.</em>  8 Record 329.  It is conceivable, I suppose, that counsel thought the judge possessed legal authority to exceed the prosecutor\'s recommendation in that respect, but not in respect of imposing death; but the possibility of baseless belief that Idaho law contained such peculiar asymmetry is surely remote.</p>\n<p>There remains, of course, the possibility that counsel genuinely (though unreasonably) believed, because of the September 6 order, that the death penalty had been precluded not in law, but as a matter of the judge\'s intentions.  But there is some indication that even this was not so.  The judge, in his lengthy statement at the end of the sentencing hearing -- concluding with the announcement that he would not sentence immediately but would take the matter under advisement -- stated that the available sentences included "[f]or example, a fixed term of 40 years <em>or death</em> or a fixed life sentence.  So there are a great number of possibilities available to this Court."  <em>Id.</em> at 330 (emphasis added).  If Lankford\'s counsel believed that the defense had been given assurance that the death penalty was (at least as a practical matter) out of the case, one would have expected a shocked objection at this point.  None was made -- though counsel was aggressive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 500 U. S. 135</a></p><p> enough in objecting to another portion of the judge\'s concluding statement, two pages later in the transcript, that the judge interrupted with "Counsel, I\'m not here to argue with you."  <em>Id.</em> at 332.</p>\n<p>The only evidence supporting detrimental (albeit unreasonable) reliance is the fact that counsel\'s presentation at the sentencing hearing did not specifically address the death penalty.  That is not terribly persuasive evidence, since all the arguments made against a life sentence or a minimum term of more than 10 years would apply <em>a fortiori</em> against a sentence of death.  In any event, counsel\'s presentation was entirely consistent with (1) belief that the death penalty was not entirely ruled out, but simply an overwhelmingly unlikely possibility, plus either (2) a tactical decision not to create the impression, by arguing the point, that that option was even thinkable, or (3) sheer negligence.  If it was the last, Lankford may have a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, which can be raised in a petition for habeas corpus.  But he has not carried the burden of sustaining the claim made here.</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>Because Lankford has not established that his counsel had any basis reasonably to believe that the death penalty was, either legally or as a practical matter, out of the case -- and indeed he has not even established that his counsel <em>unreasonably</em> believed that to be so -- we have no cause to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Idaho.  In doing so, we seemingly adopt the topsy-turvy principle that the capital defendant cannot be presumed to know the law, but must be presumed to have detrimentally relied upon a misunderstanding of the law or a misinterpretation of the judge.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Evidence at trial also established that the camping couple whom the Lankford brothers killed offered no provocation or resistance, that their skulls were brutally smashed while they were kneeling in a position of submission, that they were driven -- dead or mortally injured -- into a remote area where their bodies were hidden under branches and other debris and remained undiscovered until three months later.  <em>State v. Lankford,</em> 113 Idaho 688, 691-692, 747 P.2d 710, 713 (1987).  Thus, reasonable defense counsel would also have anticipated that a sentencer might well find additional statutory aggravating circumstances, <em>see</em> Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(g)(5) (1987) (aggravating circumstance that the murder was "especially heinous atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity"); Idaho Code \xc2\xa7 19-2515(g)(6) (aggravating circumstance that "the defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life").</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The majority, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/110/case.html#115">500 U. S. 115</a></span>, n. 7, notes that "the judge\'s comment was made prior to the State\'s response."  I fail to see how that is relevant.  The court\'s statement was that the death penalty procedures would be followed "<em>whether or not</em> the state intends to pursue the death penalty."  7 Record 56 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>As the Court also notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/110/case.html#115">500 U. S. 115</a></span>, n. 7, Lankford obtained new counsel after this discussion.  However, I think the knowledge of the first counsel (Mr. Longeteig) should be imputed to the second counsel (Ms. Fisher).  It was obviously Ms. Fisher\'s duty to inform herself of all relevant circumstances, including the knowledge of Mr. Longeteig.  That should not have been difficult, as the judge specifically ordered Mr. Longeteig to remain in the case and be at Ms. Fisher\'s "beck and call," 8 Record 25, to assist her in preparing for sentencing.  If Ms. Fisher failed to ask him about the death penalty, that cannot be labelled a due process violation attributable to the State.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
