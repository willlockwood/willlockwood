We are required to pay duties upon an estimated and fictitious value, amounting, with charges &amp;c., to $47,662.95, and we are compelled to enter the goods at their estimated and fictitious value to save penalties and forfeitures and to get possession of our property."</p>\n<p>"We protest against being committed to anything by the form of the entry, which we submit to upon compulsion, insisting that they are not according to the truths of the transactions.  The sixteenth section of the tariff law of 1842 fixes the date of purchase for shipment as the time in reference to which the value is to be ascertained, except in the case of goods imported into the United States from some country other than that of the growth or manufacture of the imported articles.  There is nothing in the eighth section, or any part of the Tariff Act of 1846, nor in any other law of the United States, inconsistent with the sixteenth section of the act of 1842."</p>\n<p>"We give notice that we intend to seek redress by suit at law and otherwise, as we may be advised, for the wrong done to us in respect to the excessive duty imposed upon this importation."</p>\n<p>"We rely upon the objection we have made, and upon such other objections founded in law and in fact as belong to the case, and we now offer to specify them to the collector, more particularly if requested so to do."</p>\n<p>"The sum of money now illegally extorted from us, over and above the true and honest duties, is $2,366.25, more or less, being 25 percent on the valuation over and above actual cost, as specified in the invoice herewith produced."</p>\n<p>"True copy.

That the payment made in this case by the plaintiffs to the defendant was a voluntary and not a coercive payment, and so that the plaintiffs could not maintain their action; that the evidence showed that the collector had been entirely passive in this whole matter, and had done no act and made no demand which compelled the plaintiffs to pay the entire amount, which they did pay upon their own advisement; that the collector merely received the sum tendered to him by the plaintiffs, and never made the payment a condition precedent to the delivery of the goods, nor threatened to raise the valuation expressed on the face of the invoice; all that was done was done by the plaintiffs themselves voluntarily, without the least coercion or action on the part of the defendant, and that the verdict should therefore be in his favor."</p>\n<p>"2.

And the court further refused to charge or instruct the jury in conformity with the points insisted upon by the defendant\'s counsel, and in conformity with which he had prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury as aforesaid."</p>\n<p>"And the counsel for said defendant then and there excepted to the said charge of the court, and to the refusal of the court to charge the jury in conformity with which the said counsel had so prayed the court to charge the jury, as aforesaid: "</p>\n<p>"And thereupon the jurors of the jury aforesaid found a verdict for the plaintiffs for three thousand two hundred and six dollars and forty-four cents."</p>\n<p>"And because the said several matters so offered and given in evidence, and the matters insisted upon by the said defendant, and the decision of the said court, and the charge of the said court, and the said exceptions taken to the same, do not appear by the record of the verdict aforesaid, the said defendant has caused the same to be written on this bill of exceptions, to be annexed to said record, and has prayed the said justice, holding the said court, to set his hand and seal to the same.

Thompson.</a></span></em>  In respect to the first one, which related to the proper time for fixing the value of goods imported from the country of their growth or manufacture, this Court there held it was the time of their procurement when not purchased, and the time of their purchase when they had been actually purchased abroad, rather than the time of their exportation or shipment.  The goods in this case were valued at the latter time, though they had been previously purchased, and at a lower price.  For the reasons assigned in the other case, the instruction given that this time was wrong must be considered legal.</p>\n<p>Another point decided in <em>Greely v. Thompson,</em> and which is a ground of exception here, was that though the money was collected in obedience to orders from the Treasury </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 51 U. S. 255</a></p><p> Department, which the collector, so far as regards the department, was bound to follow, yet this did not justify him as to others, or bar a recovery by third persons if not liable in law to pay so high duties.  For the reasons there assigned, this exception is likewise one which cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>The other points in that case do not arise here, but one does arise which did not exist there, and which we now proceed to examine.</p>\n<p>The importer had put in his invoice the price actually paid for the goods, with charges, and proposed to enter them at the value thus fixed.  But the collector concluded in that event to have them appraised, and the value would then, by instructions and usage at New York, be ascertained as at the time of the shipment, which was considerably higher, and would probably subject the importer not only to pay more duties, but to suffer a penalty.</p>\n<p>The importer protested against this, but in order to avoid the penalty, under such a wrong appraisal, adopted the following course.</p>\n<p>This being a case of purchase of goods abroad, and not procurement, it came clearly within the eighth section of the act of 1846, and therefore the importer, as that act permits, was allowed to make, and did make, an addition to his invoice, so as to escape the penalty, by means of the addition, and the payment of the consequent increased duties.  Pamphlet Laws for 1846, p. 69.</p>\n<p>This increase of duties, thus obtained, the present action is instituted to recover back, they having been paid under protest and unwillingly.  The government, however, insist that this excess of duties was caused and paid voluntarily, and hence, though illegal, cannot be recovered back.  If they were paid voluntarily, some precedents would seem to countenance the inability to sustain this suit.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/35/137/case.html">Elliot v. Swartwout,</a></span></em> 10 Pet. 137.</p>\n<p>But the gist of the point is were these increased duties in truth paid voluntarily, in the meaning of that term as applicable to the present subject?  We have already seen that the importer did not at first propose to enter his goods of such a value as to justify these increased duties.  On the contrary, he insisted on entering them at only the price for which he purchased them, with charges, and thus agreeing with his original invoice, while the collector virtually insisted on having them appraised at their increased value as at the time of the shipment, such being the usage in the custom house at New York, and such the requirement of the circular of the Secretary of the Treasury, November 24, 1846.  The importer, knowing that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 51 U. S. 256</a></p><p> this would subject him to a severe penalty, in order to avoid it felt compelled to add to his invoice the amount which the price had risen between the purchase and the shipment.</p>\n<p>But this addition and consequent payment of the higher duties were so far from voluntary in him that he accompanied them with remonstrances against being thus coerced to do the act in order to escape a greater evil, and accompanied the payment with a protest against the legality of the course pursued towards him.</p>\n<p>Now it can hardly be meant in this class of cases that to make a payment involuntary, it should be by actual violence or any physical duress.  It suffices if the payment is caused on the one part by an illegal demand and made on the other part reluctantly and in consequence of that illegality, and without being able to regain possession of his property except by submitting to the payment.  <em>See</em> cases cited hereafter</p>\n<p>All these requisites existed here.  We have already decided that the demand for such an increased appraisal was illegal.  The appraisal itself, as made, was illegal.  The raising of the invoice was thus caused by these illegalities in order to escape a greater burden in the penalty.  The payment of the increased duties thus caused was wrongfully imposed on the importer, and was submitted to merely as a choice of evils.</p>\n<p>He was unwilling to pay either the excess of duties or the penalty, and must be considered, therefore, as forced into one or the other by the collector, <em>colore officii,</em> through the invalid and illegal course pursued in having the appraisal made of the value at the wrong period, however well meant may have been the views of the collector.</p>\n<p>The money was thus obtained by a moral duress not justified by law, and which was not submitted to by the importer except to regain possession of his property withheld from him on grounds manifestly wrong.  Indeed it seems sufficient to sustain the action, whether under the Act of February 26, 1845, or under principles of the common law, if the duties exacted were not legal and were demanded and were paid under protest.  5 Stat. 727; <em>Clinton v. Strong,</em> 9 Johns. 370; 1 Miller 536; 1 Bos. &amp; P., 139; <em>Irving v. Chitsowdt,</em> 4 T.R. 485, 553; Cowp. 69, 805.</p>\n<p>All these circumstances existed here, and hence the judgment below must be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and was argued by counsel.
