JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In each of these causes, a beneficiary received from trustees royalties arising from a lease of oil and gas lands in Wyoming.  Taxes were exacted upon the full amounts so received.  Separate suits were brought to recover proper allowances for depletion.  The respondents prevailed in both of the courts below.  Here, the causes were heard together. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="193">Page 291 U.

Falk,</em> No. 225, October Term, 1933, and the argument made in the Government\'s brief in that case is likewise applicable here. . . .  There is therefore substantially no difference between the position of the beneficiaries in this case and the <em>Falk</em> case."</p>\n<p>The judgments below are affirmed upon authority of <em>Helvering v. Falk, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/291/183/case.html">291 U. S. 183</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS, MR. JUSTICE STONE, and MR.

S. 183</a></span>, because of the nature of the duties imposed upon the trustees, and of the remainder interest granted to the beneficiaries by the trust instrument presently involved, and accordingly concur in the result.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. 22, <em>Reynolds, Collector of Internal Revenue v.
