JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In May, 1976, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated rules requiring cable television systems that have 3,500 or more subscribers and carry broadcast signals to develop, at a minimum, a 20-channel capacity by 1986, to make available certain channels for access by third parties, and to furnish equipment and facilities for access purposes.  <em>Report and Order in Docket No. 20508,</em> 59 F.C.C.2d 294 (1976 Order).  The issue here is whether these rules are "reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission\'s various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting," <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html">392 U. S. 157</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#178">392 U. S. 178</a></span> (1968), and hence within the Commission\'s statutory authority.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The regulations now under review had their genesis in rules prescribed by the Commission in 1972 requiring all cable operators in the top 100 television markets to design their systems to include at least 20 channels and to dedicate 4 of those channels for public, governmental, educational, and leased access.  The rules were reassessed in the course of further rulemaking proceedings.  As a result, the Commission modified a compliance deadline, <em>Report and Order in Docket No. 206,</em> 54 F.C.C.2d 207 (1975), effected certain substantive changes, and extended the rules to all cable systems having 3,500 or more subscribers, <em>1976 Order, supra.</em>  In its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 440 U. S. 692</a></p><p> 1976 Order, the Commission reaffirmed its view that there was "a definite societal good" in preserving access channels, though it acknowledged that the "overall impact that use of these channels can have may have been exaggerated in the past."  59 F.C.C.2d at 296.</p>\n<p>As ultimately adopted, the rules prescribe a series of interrelated obligations ensuring public access to cable systems of a designated size and regulate the manner in which access is to be afforded and the charges that may be levied for providing it.  Under the rules, cable systems must posses a minimum capacity of 20 channels, as well as the technical capability for accomplishing two-way, nonvoice communication. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  47 CFR \xc2\xa7 76.252 (1977).  Moreover, to the extent of their available activated channel capacity, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] cable systems must allocate four </p><p><a class="page-number" name="693">Page 440 U. S. 693</a></p><p> separate channels for use by public, educational, local governmental, and leased-access users, with one channel assigned to each.  \xc2\xa7 76.254(a).  Absent demand for full-time use of each access channel, the combined demand can be accommodated with fewer than four channels, but with at least one.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 76.254(b), (c). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  When demand on a particular access channel exceeds a specified limit, the cable system must provide another access channel for the same purpose, to the extent of the system\'s activated capacity.  \xc2\xa7 76.254(d).  The rules also require cable systems to make equipment available for those utilizing public access channels. \xc2\xa7 76.256(a).</p>\n<p>Under the rules, cable operators are deprived of all discretion regarding who may exploit their access channels and what may be transmitted over such channels.  System operators are specifically enjoined from exercising any control over the content of access programming, except that they must adopt rules proscribing the transmission on most access channels of lottery information and commercial matter. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 76.256(b), (d).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="694">Page 440 U. S. 694</a></p><p> The regulations also instruct cable operators to issue rules providing for first-come, nondiscriminatory access on public and leased channels.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 76.256(d)(1), (3).</p>\n<p>Finally, the rules circumscribe what operators may charge for privileges of access and use of facilities and equipment.  No charge may be assessed for the use of one public access channel.  \xc2\xa7 76.256(c)(2).  Operators may not charge for the use of educational and governmental access for the first five years the system services such users.  \xc2\xa7 76.256(c)(1).  Leased access channel users must be charged an "appropriate" fee.  \xc2\xa7 76.256(d)(3).  Moreover, the rules admonish that charges for equipment, personnel, and production exacted from access users "shall be reasonable and consistent with the goal of affording users a low-cost means of television access."  \xc2\xa7 76.256(c)(3).  And "[n]o charges shall be made for live public access programs not exceeding five minutes in length."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Lastly, a system may not charge access users for utilization of its playback equipment or the personnel required to operate such equipment when the cable\'s production equipment is not deployed and when tapes or film can be played without technical alteration to the system\'s equipment.  <em>Petition for Reconsideration in Docket No. 20508,</em> 62 F.C.C.2d 399, 407 (1976).</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s capacity and access rules were challenged on jurisdictional grounds in the course of the rulemaking proceedings.  In its 1976 Order, the Commission rejected such comments on the ground that the regulations furthered objectives that it might properly pursue in its supervision over broadcasting.  Specifically, the Commission maintained that its rules would promote</p>\n<p>"the achievement of longstanding communications regulatory objectives by increasing outlets for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 440 U. S. 695</a></p><p> local self-expression and augmenting the public\'s choice of programs."</p>\n<p>59 F.C.C.2d at 298.  The Commission did not find persuasive the contention that "the access requirements are in effect common carrier obligations which are beyond our authority to impose."  <em>Id.</em> at 299.  The explanation was:</p>\n<p>"So long as the rules adopted are reasonably related to achieving objectives for which the Commission has been assigned jurisdiction, we do not think they can be held beyond our authority merely by denominating them as somehow \'common carrier\' in nature.  The proper question, we believe, is not whether they fall in one category or another of regulation -- whether they are more akin to obligations imposed on common carriers or obligations imposed on broadcasters to operate in the public interest -- but whether the rules adopted promote statutory objectives."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Additionally, the Commission denied that the rules violated the First Amendment, reasoning that, when broadcasting or related activity by cable systems is involved, First Amendment values are served by measures facilitating an exchange of ideas.</p>\n<p>On petition for review, the Eighth Circuit set aside the Commission\'s access, channel capacity, and facilities rules as beyond the agency\'s jurisdiction.  571 F.2d 1025 (1978).  The court was of the view that the regulations were not reasonably ancillary to the Commission\'s jurisdiction over broadcasting, a jurisdictional condition established by past decisions of this Court.  The rules amounted to an attempt to impose common carrier obligations on cable operators, the court said, and thus ran counter to the statutory command that broadcasters themselves may not be treated as common carriers.  <em>See</em> Communications Act of 1934, \xc2\xa7 3(h), 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153(h).  Furthermore, the court made plain its belief that the regulations presented grave First Amendment problems.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 440 U. S. 696</a></p><p> We granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 816 (1978), and we now affirm. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Commission derives its regulatory authority from the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended, 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151 <em>et seq.</em>  The Act preceded the advent of cable television, and understandably does not expressly provide for the regulation of that medium.  But it is clear that Congress meant to confer "broad authority" on the Commission, H.R.Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934), so as "to maintain, through appropriate administrative control, a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission."  <em>FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/134/case.html">309 U. S. 134</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/134/case.html#138">309 U. S. 138</a></span> (1940).  To that end, Congress subjected to regulation "all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio."  Communications Act of 1934, \xc2\xa7 2(a), 47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152(a).  In <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.,</em> we construed \xc2\xa7 2(a) as conferring on the Commission a circumscribed range of power to regulate cable television, and we reaffirmed that determination in <em>United States v. Midwest Video Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html">406 U. S. 649</a></span> (1972).  The question now before us is whether the Act, as construed in these two cases, authorizes the capacity and access regulations that are here under challenge.</p>\n<p>The <em>Southwestern</em> litigation arose out of the Commission\'s efforts to ameliorate the competitive impact on local broadcasting operations resulting from importation of distant signals by cable systems into the service areas of local stations.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="697">Page 440 U. S. 697</a></p><p> Fearing that such importation might "destroy or seriously degrade the service offered by a television broadcaster," <em>First Report and Order,</em> 38 F.C.C. 683, 700 (1965), the Commission promulgated rules requiring CATV systems [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] to carry the signals of broadcast stations into whose service area they brought competing signals, to avoid duplication of local station programming on the same day such programming was broadcast, and to refrain from bringing new distant signals into the 100 largest television markets unless first demonstrating that the service would comport with the public interest.  <em>See Second Report and Order,</em> 2 F.C.C.2d 725 (1966). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s assertion of jurisdiction was based on its view that "the successful performance" of its duty to ensure "the orderly development of an appropriate system of local television broadcasting" depended upon regulation of cable operations.  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#177">392 U. S. 177</a></span>.  Against the background of the administrative undertaking at issue, the Court construed \xc2\xa7 2(a) of the Act as granting the Commission jurisdiction over cable television "reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission\'s various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting."  392 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html#178">392 U. S. 178</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Soon after our decision in <em>Southwestern,</em> the Commission </p><p><a class="page-number" name="698">Page 440 U. S. 698</a></p><p> resolved</p>\n<p>"to condition the carriage of television broadcast signals . . . upon a requirement that the CATV system also operate to a significant extent as a local outlet by originating."</p>\n<p><em>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry,</em> 15 F.C.C.2d 417, 422 (1968).  It stated that its</p>\n<p>"concern with CATV carriage of broadcast signals [was] not just a matter of avoidance of adverse effects, but extend[ed] also to requiring CATV affirmatively to further statutory policies."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, the Commission promulgated a rule providing that CATV systems having 3,500 or more subscribers may not carry the signal of any television broadcast station unless the system also operates to a significant extent as a local outlet by originating its own programs -- or cablecasting -- and maintains facilities for local production and presentation of programs other than automated services.  47 CFR \xc2\xa7 74.1111(a) (1970).  This Court, by a 5-to-4 vote but without an opinion for the Court, sustained the Commission\'s jurisdiction to issue these regulations in <em>United States v. Midwest Video Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p>Four Justices, in an opinion by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, reaffirmed the view that the Commission has jurisdiction over cable television, and that such authority is delimited by its statutory responsibilities over television broadcasting.  They thought that the reasonably ancillary standard announced in <em>Southwestern</em> permitted regulation of CATV "with a view not merely to protect, but to promote, the objectives for which the Commission had been assigned jurisdiction over broadcasting."  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#667">406 U. S. 667</a></span>.  The Commission had reasonably determined, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN\'s opinion declared, that the origination requirement would</p>\n<p>"\'further the achievement of long-established regulatory goals in the field of television broadcasting by increasing the number of outlets for community self-expression and augmenting the public\'s choice of programs and types of services. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#667">406 U.

S. 699</a></p><p> The conclusion was that the "program origination rule [was] within the Commission\'s authority recognized in Southwestern."  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">406 U. S. 670</span>.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in a separate opinion concurring in the result, admonished that the Commission\'s origination rule "strain[ed] the outer limits" of its jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html#676">406 U. S. 676</a></span>.  Though not "fully persuaded that the Commission ha[d] made the correct decision in [the] case," he was inclined to defer to its Judgment.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Because its access and capacity rules promote the long-established regulatory goals of maximization of outlets for local expression and diversification of programming -- the objectives promoted by the rule sustained in <em>Midwest Video</em> -- the Commission maintains that it plainly had jurisdiction to promulgate them.  Respondents, in opposition, view the access regulations as an intrusion on cable system operations that is qualitatively different from the impact of the rule upheld in <em>Midwest Video.</em>  Specifically, it is urged that by requiring the allocation of access channels to categories of users specified by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="700">Page 440 U. S. 700</a></p><p> the regulations and by depriving the cable operator of the power to select individual users or to control the programming on such channels, the regulations wrest a considerable degree of editorial control from the cable operator and in effect compel the cable system to provide a kind of common carrier service.  Respondents contend, therefore, that the regulations are not only qualitatively different from those heretofore approved by the courts, but also contravene statutory limitations designed to safeguard the journalistic freedom of broadcasters, particularly the command of \xc2\xa7 3(h) of the Act that "a person engaged in . . . broadcasting shall not . . . be deemed a common carrier."  47 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 153(h).</p>\n<p>We agree with respondents that recognition of agency jurisdiction to promulgate the access rules would require an extension of this Court\'s prior decisions.  Our holding in <em>Midwest Video</em> sustained the Commission\'s authority to regulate cable television with a purpose affirmatively to promote goals pursued in the regulation of television broadcasting; and the plurality\'s analysis of the origination requirement stressed the requirement\'s nexus to such goals.  But the origination rule did not abrogate the cable operators\' control over the composition of their programming, as do the access rules.  It compelled operators only to assume a more positive role in that regard, one comparable to that fulfilled by television broadcasters.  Cable operators had become enmeshed in the field of television broadcasting, and, by requiring them to engage in the functional equivalent of broadcasting, the Commission had sought "only to ensure that [they] satisfactorily [met] community needs within the context of their undertaking."  406 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">406 U.

Indeed, in its early consideration of access obligations -- whereby "CATV operators [would] furnish studio facilities and technical assistance [but] have no control over program content except as may be required by the Commission\'s rules and applicable law" -- the Commission acknowledged that the result would be the operation of cable systems "as common carriers on some channels."  <em>First Report and Order in Docket No. 1897,</em> 20 F.C.C.2d at 207; <em>see id.</em> at 202; <em>Cable Television Report and Order,</em> 36 F.C.C.2d 143, 197 (1972).  In its <em>1976 Order,</em> the Commission did not directly deny that its access requirements compelled common carriage, and it has conceded before this Court that the rules "can be viewed as a limited form of common carriage-type obligation."  Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1575, p 39.  But the Commission continues to insist that this characterization of the obligation imposed by the rules is immaterial to the question of its power to issue them; its authority to promulgate the rules is assured, in the Commission\'s view, so long as the rules promote statutory objectives.</p>\n<p>Congress, however, did not regard the character of regulatory obligations as irrelevant to the determination of whether they might permissibly be imposed in the context of broadcasting itself.  The Commission is directed explicitly by \xc2\xa7 3(h) of the Act not to treat persons engaged in broadcasting as common carriers.  We considered the genealogy and the meaning of this provision in <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

Accordingly, we did not decide the question whether the Act, though not mandating the claimed access, would nevertheless permit the Commission to require broadcasters to extend a range of public access by regulations similar to those at issue here.  The Court speculated that the Commission might have flexibility to regulate access, 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#122">412 U.

The language of \xc2\xa7 3(h) is unequivocal; it stipulates that broadcasters shall not be treated as common carriers.  As we see it, \xc2\xa7 3(h), consistently with the policy of the Act to preserve editorial control of programming in the licensee, forecloses any discretion in the Commission to impose access requirements amounting to common carrier obligations on broadcast systems. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The provision\'s background manifests a congressional belief that the intrusion worked by such regulation on the journalistic integrity of broadcasters would overshadow any benefits associated with the resulting public access.  It is difficult to deny, then, that forcing broadcasters to develop a "nondiscriminatory system for controlling access . . . is precisely what Congress intended to avoid through \xc2\xa7 3(h) of the Act."  412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#140">412 U.

Though afforded wide latitude in its supervision over communication by wire, the Commission was not delegated unrestrained authority.  The Court regarded the Commission\'s regulatory effort at issue in <em>Southwestern</em> as consistent with the Act, because it had been found necessary to ensure the achievement of the Commission\'s statutory responsibilities. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Specifically, regulation was imperative to prevent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="707">Page 440 U.

And in <em>Midwest Video.</em> the Commission had endeavored to promote long-established goals of broadcasting regulation.  Petitioners do not deny that statutory objectives pertinent to broadcasting bear on what the Commission might require cable systems to do.  Indeed, they argue that the Commission\'s authority to promulgate the access rules derives from the relationship of those rules to the objectives discussed in <em>Midwest Video.</em>  But they overlook the fact that Congress has restricted the Commission\'s ability to advance objectives associated with public access at the expense of the journalistic freedom of persons engaged in broadcasting.</p>\n<p>That limitation is not one having peculiar applicability to television broadcasting.  Its force is not diminished by the variant technology involved in cable transmissions.

Our review of the Act in <em>Columbia Broadcasting</em> led us to conclude that \xc2\xa7 3(h) embodies a substantive determination not to abrogate a broadcaster\'s journalistic independence for the purpose of, and as a result of, furnishing members of the public with media access:</p>\n<p>"Congress pointedly refrained from divesting broadcasters of their control over the selection of voices; \xc2\xa7 3(h) of the Act stands as a firm congressional statement that broadcast licensees are not to be treated as common carriers, obliged to accept whatever is tendered by members of the public.  [The] provisio[n] clearly manifest[s] the intention of Congress to maintain a substantial measure of journalistic independence for the broadcast licensee."</p>\n<p>412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#116">412 U. S. 116</a></span>.  We now reaffirm that view of \xc2\xa7 3(h):  the purpose of the provision and its mandatory wording preclude Commission discretion to compel broadcasters to act as common carriers, even with respect to a portion of their total services.  As we demonstrate in the following text, that same constraint applies to the regulation of cable television systems.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission contends that the signal carriage rules involved in <em>Southwestern</em> are, in part, analogous to the Commission\'s access rules in question here.  The signal carriage rules required, <em>inter alia,</em> that cable operators transmit, upon request, the broadcast signals of broadcast licensees into whose service area the cable operator imported competing signals.  <em>See First Report and Order in Docket No. 1489,</em> 38 F.C.C. 683, 716-719 (1965).  But that requirement did not amount to a duty to hold out facilities indifferently for public use, and thus did not compel cable operators to function as common carriers.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/689/case.html#701">440 U. S. 701</a></span>.  Rather, the rule was limited to remedying a specific perceived evil, and thus involved a balance of considerations not addressed by \xc2\xa7 3(h).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>We do not suggest, nor do we find it necessary to conclude, that the discretion exercised by cable operators is of the same magnitude as that enjoyed by broadcasters.  Moreover, we reject the contention that the Commission\'s access rules will not significantly compromise the editorial discretion actually exercised by cable operators.  At least in certain instances the access obligations will restrict expansion of other cable services.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a> <a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a> <em>supra.</em>  And even when not occasioning the displacement of alternative programming, compelling cable operators indiscriminately to accept access programming will interfere with their determinations regarding the total service offering to be extended to subscribers.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission has argued that the capacity, access, and facilities regulations should not be reviewed as a unit, but as discrete rules entailing unique considerations.  But the Commission concedes that the facilities and access rules are integrally related, <em>see</em> Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1575, p. 36 n. 32, and acknowledges that the capacity rules were adopted in part to complement the access requirement, <em>see id.</em> at 35; <em>1976 Order,</em> 59 F.C.C.2d at 313, 322.  At the very least, it is unclear whether any particular rule or portion thereof would have been promulgated in isolation.  Accordingly, we affirm the lower court\'s determination to set aside the amalgam of rules without intimating any view regarding whether a particular element thereof might appropriately be revitalized in a different context.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>The court below suggested that the Commission\'s rules might violate the First Amendment rights of cable operators.  Because our decision rests on statutory grounds, we express no view on that question, save to acknowledge that it is not frivolous and to make clear that the asserted constitutional issue did not determine or sharply influence our construction of the statute.  The Court of Appeals intimated, additionally, that the rules might effect an unconstitutional "taking" of property or, by exposing a cable operator to possible criminal prosecution for offensive cablecasting by access users over which the operator has no control, might affront the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  We forgo comment on these issues as well.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In 1969, the Commission adopted a rule requiring cable television systems to originate a significant number of local programs.  In <em>United States v. Midwest Video Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/649/case.html">406 U. S. 649</a></span>, the Court upheld the Commission\'s authority to promulgate this "mandatory origination" rule.  Thereafter, the Commission decided that less onerous rules would accomplish its purpose of "increasing the number of outlets for community self-expression and augmenting the public\'s choice of programs and types of services." [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Accordingly, it adopted the access rules that the Court invalidates today. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="710">Page 440 U. S. 710</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In my opinion the Court\'s holding in <em>Midwest Video</em> that the mandatory origination rules were within the Commission\'s statutory authority requires a like holding with respect to the less burdensome access rules at issue here.  The Court\'s contrary conclusion is based on its reading of \xc2\xa7 3(h) of the Act as denying the Commission the power to impose common carrier obligations on broadcasters.  I am persuaded that the Court has misread the statute.</p>\n<p>Section 3(h) provides:</p>\n<p>"\'Common carrier\' or \'carrier\' means any person engaged as a common carrier for hire, in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy, except where reference is made to common carriers not subject to this chapter; but a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier."</p>\n<p>47 U.S.C. 153(h).</p>\n<p>Section 3 is the definitional section of the Act.  It does not purport to grant or deny the Commission any substantive authority.  Section 3(h) makes it clear that every broadcast station is not to be deemed a common carrier, and therefore subject to common carrier regulation under Title II of the Act, simply because it is engaged in radio broadcasting.  But nothing in the words of the statute or its legislative history suggests that \xc2\xa7 3(h) places limits on the Commission\'s exercise of powers otherwise within its statutory authority because </p><p><a class="page-number" name="711">Page 440 U. S. 711</a></p><p> a lawfully imposed requirement might be termed a "common carrier obligation." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission\'s understanding supports this reading of \xc2\xa7 3(h).  In past decisions interpreting FCC authority under the Communications Act,</p>\n<p>"we [have been] guided by the \'venerable principle that the construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html">412 U. S. 94</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#121">412 U. S. 121</a></span>, quoting <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/367/case.html">395 U. S. 367</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/6/case.html#31">395 U. S. 31</a></span>.  The Commission\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 3(h) is clear:  it has never interpreted that provision, or any other in the Communications Act, as a limitation on its authority to impose common carrier obligations on cable systems.</p>\n<p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="712">Page 440 U. S. 712</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Commission\'s 1966 rules, which gave rise to this Court\'s decision in <em>United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/157/case.html">392 U. S. 157</a></span>, imposed just such an obligation.  Under those rules, local systems were required to carry, upon request and in a specific order of priority, the signals of broadcast stations into whose viewing area they bring competing signals. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  And its 1969 rules, according to the FCC Report and Order, reflected the Commission\'s view</p>\n<p>"that a multi-purpose CATV operation combining carriage of broadcast signals with program origination and common carrier services, might best exploit cable channel capacity to the advantage of the public and promote the basic purpose for which this Commission was created. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]"</p>\n<p>Finally, in adopting the rules at issue here, the Commission explicitly rejected the rationale the Court accepts today:</p>\n<p>"So long as the rules adopted are reasonably related to achieving objectives for which the Commission has been assigned jurisdiction, we do not think they can be held beyond our authority merely by denominating them as somehow \'common carrier\' in nature.  The proper question, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="713">Page 440 U. S. 713</a></p><p> we believe, is not whether they fall in one category or another of regulation -- whether they are more akin to obligations imposed on common carriers or obligations imposed on broadcasters to operate in the public interest -- but whether the rules adopted promote statutory objectives."</p>\n<p>59 F.C.C.2d 294, 299 (1976).</p>\n<p>In my judgment, this is the correct approach.  <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, supra,</em> relied upon almost exclusively by the majority, is not to the contrary.  In that case, we reviewed the provisions of the Communications Act, including \xc2\xa7 3(h), which had some bearing on the access question presented.  We emphasized, as does the majority here, that "Congress has time and again rejected various legislative attempts that would have mandated a variety of forms of individual access."  412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#122">412 U. S. 122</a></span>.  But we went on to conclude:</p>\n<p>"That is not to say that Congress\' rejection of such proposals must be taken to mean that Congress is opposed to private rights of access under all circumstances.  <em>Rather, the point is that Congress has chosen to leave such questions with the Commission, to which it is given the flexibility to experiment with new ideas as changing conditions require.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Commission here has exercised its "flexibility to experiment" in choosing to replace the mandatory origination rule upheld in <em>Midwest Video</em> with what it views as the less onerous local access rules at issue here.  I have no reason to doubt its conclusion that these rules, like the mandatory origination rule they replace, do promote the statutory objectives of "increasing the number of outlets for community self-expression </p><p><a class="page-number" name="714">Page 440 U. S. 714</a></p><p> and augmenting the public\'s choice of programs and types of services."  And under this Court\'s holding in <em>Midwest Video,</em> this is all that is required to uphold the jurisdiction of the Commission to promulgate these rules.  Since Congress has not seen fit to modify the scope of the statute as construed in <em>Midwest Video,</em> I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case with instructions to decide the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The quotation is from the report accompanying the promulgation of the 1969 rules.  <em>See First Report and Order,</em> 20 F.C.C.2d 201, 202 (1969) (<em>1969 Order</em>).  The report accompanying the 1976 rules identifies precisely the same purpose.  <em>See Report and Order in Docket 20508,</em> 59 F.C.C.2d 294, 298 (1976) (App. 103).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>By the time of this Court\'s decision in <em>Midwest Video,</em> the Commission had adopted limited access and channel capacity rules.  <em>See Cable Television Report and Order in Docket No. 18397,</em> 36 F.C.C.2d 143 (1972); <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC,</em> 523 F.2d 1344 (CA9 1975).  In 1974, the Commission largely repealed the mandatory origination rule at issue in <em>Midwest Video</em> on the grounds that access was found to be a less burdensome and equally effective means of furthering the same statutory objectives.  <em>See Report and Order in Docket No.19988,</em> 49 F.C.C.2d 1090, 1099-1100, 1104-1106 (1974).  The 1972 access rules were reviewed and amended in 1976, <em>see Report and Order in Docket No. 2008, supra,</em> and it is these rules that are at issue here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Senate Report on the Communications Act of 1934, for example, simply stated:</p>\n<p>"Section 3:  Contains the definitions.  Most of these are taken from the Radio Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, and international conventions."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1934).  The House Report was only slightly more detailed; as to \xc2\xa7 3(h), it explained:</p>\n<p>"Since a person must be a common carrier for hire to come within this definition, it does not include press associations or other organizations engaged in the business of collecting and distributing news services, which may refuse to furnish to any person service which they are capable of furnishing, and may furnish service under varying arrangements, establishing the service to be rendered, the terms under which rendered, and the charges therefor."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1850, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1934).  Finally, the Conference Report "noted that the definition does not include any person if not a common carrier in the ordinary sense of the term."  H.R.Conf.Rep. No.1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 46 (1934).</p>\n<p>Section 3(h), it seems clear to me, cannot be read to be directly applicable to cable systems in any regard.  Such systems are not, in the full range of their activities, "common carrier[s] in the ordinary sense of the term."  And, as relevant here, they are technically not broadcasters at all; what they are engaged in is the distinct process of "cablecasting."  <em>See 1969 Order, supra,</em> at 223.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Second Report and Order in Docket 14895,</em> 2 F.C.C.2d 725 (1966).
