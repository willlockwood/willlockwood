Proceeds from these resources are held by the United States in trust for the Tribe.  The Tribe filed a breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking monetary damages for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mismanagement of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7161\xe2\x80\x93162a and other laws.  During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production of certain documents.  The Government agreed to release some of the documents, but asserted that others were protected by, <em>inter alia,</em> the attorney-client privilege.  The CFC granted the motion in part, holding that departmental communications relating to the management of trust funds fall within a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the attorney-client privilege.  Under that exception, which courts have applied to common-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against trust beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Denying the Government\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.  The appeals court held that the United States cannot deny a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s request to discover communications between the Government and its attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when those communications concern management of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not apply to the general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and the nature of the Indian trust relationship.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust funds were used to pay the attorney.  In the leading American case, <em>Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.</em> v. <em>Zimmer</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d 709, the Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memorandum related to the trust\xe2\x80\x99s administration because: (1) the trustees had obtained the legal advice as \xe2\x80\x9cmere representative[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of the beneficiaries, who were the \xe2\x80\x9creal clients\xe2\x80\x9d of the attorney, <em>id.</em>, at 711\xe2\x80\x93712, and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the beneficiaries outweighed the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 interest in the attorney-client privilege, <em>id.</em>, at 714.  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary exception based on the same two criteria.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private trustee.  While the United States\xe2\x80\x99 responsibilities with respect to the management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by statute, not the common law, see, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Navajo Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/488/index.html">537 U. S. 488</a>, 506 <em>(Navajo\xc2\xa0I),</em> and in fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, <em>e.g., Heckman</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/224/413/index.html">224 U. S. 413</a>, 437.  Once federal law imposes fiduciary obligations on the Government, the common law \xe2\x80\x9ccould play a role,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Navajo Nation</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ <em>(Navajo II); e.g., </em>to inform the interpretation of statutes, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/465/index.html">537 U. S. 465</a>, 475\xe2\x80\x93476.  But the applicable statutes and regulations control.  When \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tribe cannot identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Government violated \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0neither the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98control\xe2\x80\x99 over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Navajo II</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d based on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust.  <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 711\xe2\x80\x93712.  Applying these factors, the Court concludes that the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \xe2\x80\x9cmere representative\xe2\x80\x9d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d for whom that advice is intended.  See <em>id</em>., at 711.  Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe.  The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe.  Because its sovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 private interests, the Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, capacity.  Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may need to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental and conservation obligations.  It may also face conflicting duties to different tribes or individual Indians.  It may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help determine whether there are conflicting interests at all.  For the attorney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable.  See, <em>e.g., Jaffee</em> v. <em>Redmond</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/1/index.html">518 U. S. 1</a>, 18.  The Government will not always be able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests, especially before receiving counsel\xe2\x80\x99s advice.  If the Government were required to identify the specific interests it considered in each communication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be substantially compromised.  See <em>Upjohn Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/383/index.html">449 U. S. 383</a>, 393.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception properly applied here because of the fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s duty to disclose all trust-management-related information to the beneficiary.  The Government, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.  In this case, 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7162a(d) delineates the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrust responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  It identifies the Interior Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to supply tribal account holders \xe2\x80\x9cwith periodic statements of their account performance\xe2\x80\x9d and to make \xe2\x80\x9cavailable on a daily basis\xe2\x80\x9d their account balances, \xc2\xa7162a(d)(5).  The Secretary has complied with these requirements in regulations mandating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly statement of performance.  25 CFR pt. 115.8.  The common law of trusts does not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regulations.  A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibilities as nonexhaustive, see \xc2\xa7162a(d), cannot be read to include a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts, since that would vitiate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mackey </em>v.<em> Lanier Collection Riggs Agency &amp; Service</em>,<em> Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/825/index.html">486 U. S. 825</a>, 837.  By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue are classed \xe2\x80\x9cthe property of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d while other records are \xe2\x80\x9cthe property of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 CFR \xc2\xa7115.1000.  This Court considers ownership of records to be a significant factor in deciding who \xe2\x80\x9cought to have access to the document,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Riggs, supra,</em> at 712.  Here, that privilege belongs to the United States.

The common law, however, has recognized an exception to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice related to the exercise of fiduciary duties.  In such cases, courts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney-client communications from the beneficiary of the trust.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception applies to the general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.  We hold that it does not.  Although the Government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities with re-spect to the management of funds belonging to Indian tribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far.  The trust obligations of the United States to the Indian tribes are established and governed by statute rather than the common law, and in fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not as a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law.  The reasons for the fiduciary exception\xe2\x80\x94that the trustee has no independent interest in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject to a general common-law duty of disclosure\xe2\x80\x94do not apply in this context.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000-acre reservation in northern New Mexico that was established by Executive Order in 1887.  The land contains timber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are developed pursuant to statutes administered by the Department of the Interior.  Proceeds derived from these natural resources are held by the United States in trust for the Tribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other statutes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC).  The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act, \xc2\xa71505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims against the Government that are founded on the Constitution, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States.  The complaint seeks monetary damages for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the Tribe.  The Tribe argues that the Government violated various laws, including 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7161a and 162a, that govern the management of funds held in trust for Indian tribes.  See 88 Fed.\xc2\xa0Cl. 1, 3 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government and the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolution in order to resolve the claim.  During that time, the Government turned over thousands of documents but withheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was restored to the active litigation docket.  The CFC divided the case into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.  The first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government\xe2\x80\x99s management of the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s trust accounts from 1972 to 1992.  The Tribe alleges that during this period the Government failed to invest its trust funds properly.  Among other things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to maximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily in short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust\nfunds with other tribal trusts.  During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel the Government to produce the 226 withheld documents.  In response, the Government agreed to withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege and, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents.  But the Government continued to assert the attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to the remaining 155 documents.  The CFC reviewed those documents <em>in camera</em> and classified them into five cate-gories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust administration sent by personnel at the Department of the Interior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal affairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the Solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treas-\nury Departments, (3) documents generated under contracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Interior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and (5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other categories.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CFC granted the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s motion to compel in part.  The CFC held that communications relating to the management of trust funds fall within a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the attorney-client privilege.  Under that exception, which courts have applied in the context of common-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the execution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of the trust.  The CFC concluded that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that the exception should apply.  Accordingly, the CFC held, the United States may not shield from the Tribe communications with attorneys relating to trust matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in the first two categories because those documents \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve matters regarding the administration of tribal trusts, either directly or indirectly implicating the investments that benefit Jicarilla\xe2\x80\x9d and contain \xe2\x80\x9clegal advice relating to trust administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  The CFC allowed\nthe Government to withhold most of the documents in the remaining categories as attorney work product,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] but the court identified some individual documents that it determined were also subject to the fiduciary exception.  <em>Id</em>., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the documents by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC to vacate its production order.  The Court of Appeals denied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly applied the fiduciary exception.  The court held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States cannot deny an Indian tribe\xe2\x80\x99s request to discover communications between the United States and its attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when those communications concern management of an Indian trust and the United States has not claimed that the government or its attorneys considered a specific com-peting interest in those communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In re United States</em>, 590 F.\xc2\xa03d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009).  In qualifying its holding, the court recognized that sometimes the Government may have other statutory obligations that clash with its fiduciary duties to the Indian tribes.  But because the Government had not alleged that the legal advice in this case related to such conflicting interests, the court reserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might apply in that situation.  The court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that, because its duties to the Indian tribes were governed by statute rather than the common law, it had no general duty of disclosure that would override the attorney-client privilege.  The court also disagreed with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention that a case-by-case approach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredictable and would impair the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain confidential legal advice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2011),[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and now reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that evidentiary privileges \xe2\x80\x9cshall be governed by the principles of the common law \xe2\x80\xa6 in the light of reason and experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed.

Unless applicable law provides other-wise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege in civil litigation to protect confidential communications between Government officials and Government attorneys.  <em>Id.</em>, at 574 (\xe2\x80\x9c[G]overnmental agencies and employees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental counterparts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust relationship between the Government and the Tribe, documents that would otherwise be privileged must be disclosed.  As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds of the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as a principle of trust law in the 19th century.  The rule was that when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the administration of the trust, and not for the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s own defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of documents related to that advice.  <em>Wynne</em> v. <em>Humberston,</em> 27 Beav. 421, 423\xe2\x80\x93424, 54 Eng.\xc2\xa0Rep. 165, 166 (1858); <em>Talbot</em> v. <em>Marshfield</em> 2 Dr. &amp; Sm. 549, 550\xe2\x80\x93551, 62 Eng.\xc2\xa0Rep. 728, 729 (1865).  The courts reasoned that the normal attorney-client privilege did not apply in this situation because the legal advice was sought for the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 benefit and was obtained at the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 expense by using trust funds to pay the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  <em>Ibid.;</em> <em>Wynne</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 423\xe2\x80\x93424, 54 Eng. Rep., at 166.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fiduciary exception quickly became an established feature of English common law, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Mason</em>, 22 Ch.\xc2\xa0D. 609 (1883), but it did not appear in this country until the following century.  American courts seem first\nto have expressed skepticism.  See <em>In re Prudence-Bonds Corp.</em>, 76 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948) (declining to apply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a bondholding corporation because of the \xe2\x80\x9cimportant right of such a corporate trustee \xe2\x80\xa6 to seek legal advice and nevertheless act in accordance with its own judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  By the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, however, American courts began to adopt the English common-law rule.  See <em>Garner</em> v. <em>Wolfinbarger</em>, 430 F.\xc2\xa02d 1093, 1103\xe2\x80\x931104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon a showing of \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause,\xe2\x80\x9d to discover legal advice given to corporate management).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The leading American case on the fiduciary exception is <em>Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.</em> v. <em>Zimmer</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976).  In that case, the beneficiaries of a trust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the estate for alleged breaches of trust.  The beneficiaries moved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memorandum related to the administration of the trust that the trustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege.  The Delaware Chancery Court, observing that \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican case law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee in this context,\xe2\x80\x9d looked to the English cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 712.  Applying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court held that the memorandum was discoverable.  It identified two reasons for applying the exception.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the legal advice as \xe2\x80\x9cmere representative[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of the beneficiaries because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 interest when administering the trust.  <em>Ibid.</em>  For that reason, the beneficiaries were the \xe2\x80\x9creal clients\xe2\x80\x9d of the attorney who had advised the trustee on trust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client privilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather than the trustees.  <em>Id.</em>, at 711\xe2\x80\x93712.  The court based its \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d determination on several factors: (1) when the advice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the trustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore there was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court saw no indication that the memorandum was intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the law firm had been paid out of trust assets.  That the advice was obtained at the beneficiaries\xe2\x80\x99 expense was not only a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant factor\xe2\x80\x9d entitling the beneficiaries to see the document but also \xe2\x80\x9ca strong indication of precisely who the real clients were.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 712.  The court distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9clegal advice procured at the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s <em>own</em> expense and for his <em>own</em> protection,\xe2\x80\x9d which would remain privileged, \xe2\x80\x9cand the situation where the trust itself is assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where interests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the trustees could not withhold those attorney-client communications from the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the court concluded that the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi-ciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client privilege.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis here ultimately more important than the protection of the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 714.  Because more information helped the beneficiaries to police the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 management of the trust, disclosure was, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, \xe2\x80\x9ca weight-ier public policy than the preservation of confidential attorney-client communications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary exception based on the same two criteria.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re Long Island Lighting Co.</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 268, 272 (CA2 1997); <em>Wachtel</em> v. <em>Health Net, Inc.</em>, 482 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 233\xe2\x80\x93234 (CA3 2007); <em>Solis</em> v. <em>Food Employers Labor Relations Assn</em>., 2011 U.

Not until the decision below had a federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the United States as trustee for the Indian tribes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the Court of Appeals analogized the Government to a private trustee.  590 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1313.  We have applied that analogy in limited contexts, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/206/index.html">463 U. S. 206</a>, 226 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II)</em>, but that does not mean the Government resembles a private trustee in every respect.  On the contrary, this Court has previously noted that the relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is distinctive, \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from that existing between individuals whether dealing at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, <em>as trustees and beneficiaries</em>, or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Klamath and Moadoc Tribes </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/244/index.html">296 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7162a, that trust is defined and governed by statutes rather than the common law.

Thus, while trust administration \xe2\x80\x9crelat[es] to the welfare of the Indians, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress has prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is distinctly an interest of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heckman</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/224/413/index.html">224 U.

Such a result was possible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role over the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the governing authority enforcing statutory law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not question \xe2\x80\x9cthe undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U.

The Government, following \xe2\x80\x9ca humane and self imposed policy \xe2\x80\xa6 has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Seminole Nation </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/286/index.html">316 U.

Congress has expressed this policy in a series of statutes that have defined and redefined the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.  In some cases, Congress established only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow purpose.  See <em>Mitchell I</em>, 445 U.

The Indian tribes have been called \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic dependent nations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cherokee Nation</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831), under the \xe2\x80\x9ctutelage\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States, <em>Heckman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 444, and subject to \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s guardianship over . . . their affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/231/28/index.html">231 U. S. 28</a>, 48 (1913).  These concepts do not necessarily correspond to a common-law trust relationship.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Restatement 2d, \xc2\xa77 (\xe2\x80\x9cA guardianship is not a trust\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is because Congress has chosen to structure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.  We will apply common-law trust principles where Congress has indicated it is appropriate to do so.  For that reason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by statute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged information from the Government against its wishes.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s claim arises from 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7161\xe2\x80\x93162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, \xc2\xa74001 <em>et seq</em>.  These pro-visions define \xe2\x80\x9cthe trust responsibilities of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to tribal funds.  \xc2\xa7162a(d).  The Court of Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these and other statutes, is \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  590 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1313.  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have discussed, the Government exercises its carefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign capacity to implement national policy respecting the Indian tribes.  The two features justifying the fiduciary exception\xe2\x80\x94the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s status as the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d and the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s common-law duty to disclose information about the trust\xe2\x80\x94are notably absent in the trust relationship Congress has established between the United States and the Tribe.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception based on its determination that the Tribe rather than\nthe Government was the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the Government attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 advice.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d based on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust.  <em>Riggs</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 711\xe2\x80\x93712.  Applying these factors, we conclude that the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \xe2\x80\x9cmere representative\xe2\x80\x9d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d for whom that advice is intended.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe.  Courts look to the source of funds as a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong indicator of precisely who the real clients were\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant factor\xe2\x80\x9d in determining who ought to have access to the legal advice.  <em>Id.</em>, at 712.  We similarly find it significant that the attorneys were paid by the Government for advice regarding the Government\xe2\x80\x99s statutory obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The payment structure confirms our view that the Government seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe.  Undoubtedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s management of tribal trusts.  That intention represents \xe2\x80\x9ca humane and self imposed policy\xe2\x80\x9d based on felt \xe2\x80\x9cmoral obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Seminole Nation</em>, 316 U. S., at 296\xe2\x80\x93297.  This statutory purpose does not imply a full common-law trust, however.  Cf. Restatement 2d, \xc2\xa725, Comment <em>b</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cNo trust is created if the settlor manifests an intention to impose merely a moral obligation\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress makes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign governing authority, and the implementation of federal policy remains \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctly an interest of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heckman</em>, 224 U. S., at 437.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active interest\xe2\x80\x9d in the disposition of Indian assets because the terms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the United States.  <em>McKay</em> v. <em>Kalyton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/204/458/index.html">204 U. S. 458</a>, 469 (1907).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In some prior cases, we have found that the Government had established the trust relationship in order to impose its own policy on Indian lands.  See <em>Mitchell I</em>, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress \xe2\x80\x9cintended that the United States \xe2\x80\x98hold the land \xe2\x80\xa6 in trust\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 because it wished to prevent alienation of the land\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other cases, the Government has invoked its trust relationship to prevent state interference with its policy toward the Indian tribes.  See <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/305/382/index.html">305 U. S. 382</a>, 386 (1939); <em>Candelaria</em>, 271 U.

And the exercise of federal authority thereby established has often been \xe2\x80\x9cleft under the acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive Department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Heckman</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 446.  In this way, Congress has designed the trust relationship to serve the interests of the United States as well as to benefit the Indian tribes.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rickert</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/188/432/index.html">188 U. S. 432</a>, 443 (1903) (trust relationship \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98authorizes the adoption on the part of the United States of such policy as their own public interests may dictate\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Choctaw Nation</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/119/1/index.html">119 U.

The United States has a sovereign interest in the administration of Indian trusts distinct from the private interests of those who may benefit from its administration.  Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cmanagement does not manage for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Garner</em>, 430 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1101; <em>Wachtel</em>, 482 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 232 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]f central importance in both <em>Garner</em> and <em>Riggs</em> was the fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Government is never in that position.  While one purpose of the Indian trust relationship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its own independent interest in the implementation of federal Indian policy.  For that reason, when the Government seeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal trusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship related to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law.  In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a fiduciary capacity.  See <em>Riggs</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 711.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communication.  When \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple interests\xe2\x80\x9d are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence between the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee breaks down.  <em>Id.</em>, at 714.  That principle applies with particular force to the Government.  Because of the multiple interests it must represent, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government cannot follow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting interests without the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/110/index.html">463 U.

The Government may need to comply with other statutory duties, such as the environmental and conservation obligations that the Court of Appeals discussed.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1314\xe2\x80\x931315.  The Government may also face conflicting obligations to different tribes or individual Indians.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nance</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 645 F.\xc2\xa02d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal Government has \xe2\x80\x9cconflicting fiduciary responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d to the Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); <em>Hoopa Valley Tribe</em> v. <em>Christie</em>, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo trust relation exists which can be discharged to the plaintiff here at the expense of other Indians\xe2\x80\x9d).  Within the bounds of its \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral trust relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with the Indian people, we have recognized that the Government has \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to reorder its priorities from serving a subgroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all Indians nationwide.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lincoln</em> v. <em>Vigil</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/182/index.html">508 U.

And sometimes, we have seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes to dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of those for whom it was nominally kept in trust.  The Government may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests.  Indeed, the point of consulting counsel may be to determine whether conflicting interests are at stake.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s multiple obligations by suggesting that the Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it identifies \xe2\x80\x9ca specific competing interest\xe2\x80\x9d that was considered in the particular communications it seeks to withhold.  590 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1313.  But the conflicting interests the Government must consider are too pervasive for such a case-by-case approach to be workable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable.

If the Government were required to identify the specific interests it considered in each communication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be substantially compromised.  The Government will not always be able to predict what considerations qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific competing interest,\xe2\x80\x9d especially in advance of receiving counsel\xe2\x80\x99s advice.  Forcing the Government to monitor all the considerations contained in each communication with counsel would render its attorney-client privilege \xe2\x80\x9clittle better than no privilege at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary exception properly applied to the Government because \xe2\x80\x9cthe fiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to trust management to the beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d  590 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1312.  In general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust must produce trust-related information to the beneficiary on a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes limited and may be modified by the settlor.

As we have previously said, common-law principles are relevant only when applied to a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Navajo II</em>, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7162a(d), which delineates \xe2\x80\x9ctrust responsibilities of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d that the Secretary of the Interior must discharge.  The enumerated responsibilities include a provision identifying the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide specific information to tribal account holders: The Secretary must \xe2\x80\x9csuppl[y] account holders with periodic statements of their account performance\xe2\x80\x9d and must make \xe2\x80\x9cavailable on a daily basis\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cbalances of their account.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7162a(d)(5).  The Secretary has complied with these requirements by adopting regulations that instruct the Office of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe with a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR \xc2\xa7115.801 (2010), that identifies \xe2\x80\x9cthe source, type, and status of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust account; the beginning balance; the gains and losses; receipts and disbursements; and the ending account balance of the quarterly statement period,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7115.803.

Those provisions define the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure ob-ligation to the Tribe.  The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for Respondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust responsibilities as nonexhaustive.  See \xc2\xa7162a(d) (trust responsibilities \xe2\x80\x9care not limited to\xe2\x80\x9d those enumerated).  The Government replies that this clause \xe2\x80\x9cis best read to refer to other statutory and regulatory requirements\xe2\x80\x9d rather than to common-law duties.  Brief for United States 38.  Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the clause to include a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts.  When Congress provides specific statutory obligations, we will not read a \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d provision to impose general obligations that would include those specifically enumerated.  <em>Massachusetts Mut.

For example, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in American society.\xe2\x80\x9d  F.

The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development, and social programs for themselves.

The control over the Indian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to the trust relationship\xe2\x80\x94forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining alienation\xe2\x80\x94does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common-law trustee.  Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and administered as an instrument of federal policy.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly analogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust.  A revocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to the beneficiary.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may revoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bogert \xc2\xa7962, at 25, \xc2\xa7964; Restatement 3d, \xc2\xa774, Comment <em>e</em>, at 31 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or accountings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the trust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor or in the terms of the trust or a statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  In many respects, Indian trusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has acted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to alter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal property interests.

The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims that the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States.  If the Secretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was required to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon their request, to provide \xe2\x80\x9cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1978.

Where, as here, the governing statutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary relationship, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s duties include fiduciary obligations derived from common-law trust principles.  Because the common-law rationales for the fiduciary exception fully support its application in this context, I would hold that the Government may not rely on the attorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation communications between the Government and its attorneys relating to trust fund management.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to the contrary rests on false factual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other Indian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pending cases seeking relief for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mismanagement of their trust funds.  But perhaps more troubling is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s disregard of our settled precedent that looks to common-law trust principles to define the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes.  Indeed, aspects of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion suggest that common-law principles have little or no re-levance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court rejected long ago.  Although today\xe2\x80\x99s holding pertains only to a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion may well be a further dilution of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations that will have broader negative repercussions for the relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part that \xe2\x80\x9cthe privilege of a \xe2\x80\xa6 government \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 501 \xe2\x80\x9cwas adopted precisely because Congress wished to leave privilege questions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Weber Aircraft Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/792/index.html">465 U. S. 792</a>, 804, n. 25 (1984).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client privilege \xe2\x80\x9cis to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Upjohn Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/383/index.html">449 U. S. 383</a>, 389 (1981).  But the majority neglects to explain that the privilege is a limited exception to the usual rules of evidence requiring full disclosure of relevant information.  See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \xc2\xa72192, p.\xc2\xa064 (3d ed. 1940) (common law recognizes \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental maxim that the public \xe2\x80\xa6 has a right to every man\xe2\x80\x99s evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cany exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because it \xe2\x80\x9chas the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder,\xe2\x80\x9d courts construe the privilege narrowly.  <em>Fisher</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/index.html">425 U. S. 391</a>, 403 (1976).  It applies \xe2\x80\x9conly where necessary to achieve its purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>; \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here this purpose ends, so too does the protection of the privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Health Net, Inc.</em>, 482 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 231 (CA3 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege has its roots in 19th-century English common-law cases holding that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a trustee obtained legal advice relating to his administration of the trust, and not in antici-pation of adversarial legal proceedings against him, the beneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of that advice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(collecting cases).  The fiduciary exception is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both federal and state courts,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and has been applied in a wide variety of contexts, including in litigation involving common-law trusts, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C. </em>v. <em>Zimmer</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes between corporations and shareholders, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Garner</em> v. <em>Wolfinbarger</em>, 430 F.\xc2\xa02d 1093 (CA5 1970), and ERISA enforcement actions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe</em>, 162 F.\xc2\xa03d 554 (CA9 1999).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority correctly identifies the two rationales courts have articulated for applying the fiduciary exception, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, but its description of those rationales omits a number of important points.  With regard to the first rationale, courts have characterized the trust beneficiary as the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d of legal advice relating to trust administration because such advice, provided to a trustee to assist in his management of the trust, is ultimately for the benefit of the trust beneficiary, rather than for the trustee in his personal capacity.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mett</em>, 178 F.\xc2\xa03d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[A]s a representative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is administering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that he is personally being served\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans</em>, 796 F.\xc2\xa02d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) <em>(per curiam)</em>)); <em>Riggs</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 713 (same).  The majority places heavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal advice, see <em>ante</em>, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who pays for the legal advice, although \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially relevant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Third) of Trusts \xc2\xa782, Comment <em>f</em>, p.\xc2\xa0188 (2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement).  Instead, the lynchpin of the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry is the identity of the ultimate beneficiary of the legal advice.  See <em>Wachtel</em>, 482 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 232 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]f central importance \xe2\x80\xa6 [i]s the fiduciary\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the advice was rendered for the benefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any personal capacity, the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d of the advice is the beneficiary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception\xe2\x80\x94rooted in the trustee\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty to disclose all information related to trust management\xe2\x80\x94the majority glosses over the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto enable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of trust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Third Restatement \xc2\xa782, Comment <em>a(2)</em>, at 184.  As the leading American case on the fiduciary exception explains, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n order for the beneficiaries to hold the trustee to the proper standards of care and honesty and procure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled, their knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust management is crucial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riggs</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 712.  Courts justifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale have thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship is \xe2\x80\xa6 ultimately more important than the pro-tection of the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 714; see <em>Mett</em>, 178 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1063 (under this rationale, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fiduciary exception can be understood as an instance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the face of a competing legal principle\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority fails to appreciate the important oversight and accountability interests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex-ception, or explain why they operate with any less force in the Indian trust context.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in this case is whether the fiduciary exception applies in the Indian trust context such that the Government may not rely on the attorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation communications between the Government and its attorneys relating to the administration of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust fund accounts.  Answering that question requires a proper understanding of the nature of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s trust relationship with Indian tribes, particularly with regard to its management of Indian trust funds.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.  See <em>Cherokee Nation</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Our decisions over the past century have repeatedly reaffirmed this \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government\xe2\x80\x9d in its dealings with Indians.  <em>Seminole Nation </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/286/index.html">316 U. S. 286</a>, 296 (1942); see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/206/index.html">463 U. S. 206</a>, 225\xe2\x80\x93226 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II)</em> (collecting cases and noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress, too, has recognized the general trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]early every piece of modern legislation dealing with Indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the trust relationship between tribes and the federal government.\xe2\x80\x9d  F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \xc2\xa75.04[4][a], pp. 420\xe2\x80\x93421 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this backdrop, Congress has enacted federal statutes that \xe2\x80\x9cdefine the contours of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 fiduciary responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to its management of Indian tribal property and other trust assets.  <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 224.  The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s claims as relevant in this case concern the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mismanagement of its tribal trust fund accounts.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The system of trusteeship and federal management of Indian funds originated with congressional enactments in the 19th century directing the Government to hold and manage Indian tribal funds in trust.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Act of June 9, 1837, 5 Stat. 135; see also Misplaced Trust: The Bureau of Indian Affairs\xe2\x80\x99 Mismanagement of the Indian Trust Fund, H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 102\xe2\x80\x93449, p.\xc2\xa06 (1992) (hereinafter Misplaced Trust).  Through these and later congressional enactments, the United States has come to manage almost $3 billion in tribal funds and collects close to $380 million per year on behalf of tribes.  Cohen \xc2\xa75.03[3][b], at 407.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, numerous statutes outline the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligations as trustee in managing Indian trust funds.  In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury, at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, must invest \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll funds held in trust by the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 to the credit of Indian tribes\xe2\x80\x9d in certain securities \xe2\x80\x9csuitable to the needs\nof the fund involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7161a(a).  The Secretary of the Interior may deposit in the Treasury and pay mandatory interest on Indian trust funds when \xe2\x80\x9cthe best interests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits, in lieu of investments.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7161.  Similarly, the Secretary of the Interior may invest tribal trust funds in certain public debt instruments \xe2\x80\x9cif he deems it advisable and for the best interest of the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7162a(a).  And Congress has set forth a nonexhaustive list of the Secretary of the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrust responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to Indian trust funds, which include a series of accounting, auditing, management, and disclosure obligations.  \xc2\xa7162a(d).  These and other statutory provisions[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] give the United States \xe2\x80\x9cfull responsibility to manage Indian [trust fund accounts] for the benefit of the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 224.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[A] fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the Government assumes such elaborate control over [trust assets] belonging to Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 225.  Under the statutory regime described above, the Government has extensive managerial control over Indian trust funds, exercises considerable discretion with respect to their in-vestment, and has assumed significant responsibilities to account to the tribal beneficiaries.  As a result, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll of the necessary elements of a common-law trust are present:\na trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the Indian [Tribe]), and a trust corpus (Indian \xe2\x80\xa6 funds).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

As explained below, the twin rationales for the fiduciary exception fully support its application in this context.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed factual and legal premises.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Government seeks legal advice from a government attorney on matters relating to the management of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust funds, the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d of that advice for purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not the Government.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of that conclusion is premised on its erroneous view that the Government, in managing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust funds, \xe2\x80\x9chas its own independent interest in the implementation of federal Indian policy\xe2\x80\x9d that diverges from the interest of the Nation as beneficiary.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18; see also <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter, the Government has sovereign interests in managing Indian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Minnesota</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/270/181/index.html">270 U. S. 181</a>, 194 (1926).  Throughout the history of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered and administered the trust relationship \xe2\x80\x9cas an instrument of federal policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17, n.\xc2\xa08 (detailing shifts in policy); see generally <em>Cobell </em>v. <em>Norton</em>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d 1081, 1086\xe2\x80\x931088 (CADC 2001) (same, and describing that history as \xe2\x80\x9ccontentious and tragic\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the specific context of Indian trust fund management, however, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests of the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as beneficiary.  As explained above, Congress has enacted an extensive network of statutes regulating the Government\xe2\x80\x99s management of Indian trust fund accounts.  That statutory framework establishes a \xe2\x80\x9cconventional fiduciary re-lationship\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of Indian trust fund admini-stration.  <em>Navajo Nation II</em>, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a conventional fiduciary, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s management of Indian trust funds must \xe2\x80\x9cbe judged by the most exacting<em> </em>fiduciary standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Seminole Nation</em>, 316 U. S., at 296\xe2\x80\x93297.  Among the most fundamental fiduciary obligations of a trustee is \xe2\x80\x9cto administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  2A A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts \xc2\xa7170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see <em>Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon</em>, 249 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 458, 464, 164 N.\xc2\xa0E. 545, 546 (1928) (Cardozo, C.\xc2\xa0J.)

Although Indian trust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not part of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s general funds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohen \xc2\xa75.03[3][b], at 408, and n.\xc2\xa0140 (citing <em>Quick Bear </em>v. <em>Leupp</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/210/50/index.html">210 U.

By law, the Government cannot pursue any \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d interest, <em>ante</em>, at 18, distinct from its responsibilities as a fiduciary.  See Cohen \xc2\xa75.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 141 (\xe2\x80\x9cFederal statutes forbid use of Indian tribal funds in any man-\nner not authorized by treaty or express provisions of\nlaw\xe2\x80\x9d (citing 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7122, 123)).  In other words, any uniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in other contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes does not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund administration.  It naturally follows, then, that when the Government seeks legal advice from government attorneys relating to the management of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust funds, the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion holds true even though government attorneys are \xe2\x80\x9cpaid out of congressional appropriations\nat no cost to the [Nation].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  As noted above, although the source of funding for legal advice may be relevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the legal advice was rendered.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  And, for all the emphasis the majority places on the funding source here, see <em>ante</em>, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that the fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended federal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government attorneys out of their own trust funds.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of the United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in some contexts, that \xe2\x80\x9cequivalence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbreaks down\xe2\x80\x9d when there are \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple interests\xe2\x80\x9d involved in a trust relationship.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  According to the majority, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As a result, the majority concludes that the fiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the Indian trust context.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Preliminarily, while the Government in certain circumstances may have sovereign obligations that conflict with its duties as a fiduciary for Indian tribes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nevada</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/110/index.html">463 U. S. 110</a> (1983),[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] the existence of competing interests is not unique to the Government as trustee.  Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises frequently in the private trust context.

In such circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9ca trustee\xe2\x80\x94and ultimately a court\xe2\x80\x94may need to provide some response that offers a compromise between the confidentiality or privacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa782, Comment <em>f</em>, at 188.  The majority provides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context could not similarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes into account any unique governmental interests that bear on the application of the fiduciary exception in any given circumstance.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (authorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equitable concerns).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s categorical rejection of the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader than necessary.  This case involves only the Government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged mismanagement of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust fund accounts, and the Government did not claim below that the attorney-client communications at issue relate to any competing governmental obligations.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a\xe2\x80\x9319a.  To the extent the United States in other contexts has competing interests, the Government and its attorneys already have to identify those interests in determining how to balance them against their obligations to Indian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating to those interests may properly be withheld or redacted consistent with application of the fiduciary exception.  See 88 Fed. Cl.\xc2\xa01, 13 (2009) (observing that redactions \xe2\x80\x9callo[w] the privilege and exception to reign supreme within their respective spheres\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s categorical approach fails to appreciate that privilege determinations are by their very nature made on a case-by-case\xe2\x80\x94indeed, document-by-document\xe2\x80\x94basis.  Government attorneys, like private counsel, must review each requested document and make an individualized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privilege logs and challenges must do the same.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhile such a \xe2\x80\x98case-by-case\xe2\x80\x99 basis may to some slight extent undermine desirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client privilege, it obeys the spirit of\xe2\x80\x9d of Rule 501, <em>Upjohn</em>, 449 U. S., at 396\xe2\x80\x93397, which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provide[s] the courts with the flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case basis,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/40/index.html">445 U.

See <em>Upjohn</em>, 449 U.

As explained above, courts relying on this second rationale have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship is \xe2\x80\xa6 ultimately more important than the protection of the trustees\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riggs</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 714.  Because the statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a conventional fiduciary in managing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s trust funds, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation informed of matters relating to trust administration includes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client communications relating to trust fund management.  See Third Restatement \xc2\xa782, Comment <em>f</em>, at 187\xe2\x80\x93188; Restatement of the Law (Third) Governing Lawyers \xc2\xa784, pp. 627\xe2\x80\x93628 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, the majority does not suggest that the Nation needs less information than a private beneficiary to exercise effective oversight over the Government as trustee.  Instead, the majority contends that the Nation is entitled to less disclosure because the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure obligations are more limited than a private trustee.  In particular, the majority states that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus the Nation \xe2\x80\x9cmust point to a right conferred by statute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged information from the Government against its wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  The majority cites a single statutory provision and its implementing regulations as \xe2\x80\x9cdefin[ing] the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure obligation to the [Nation].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22; see <em>ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (citing 25 U.

Because those \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly defined disclosure obligations\xe2\x80\x9d do not provide Indian tribes with a specific statutory right to disclosure of attorney-client communications relating to trust administration, <em>ante</em>, at 22, the majority concludes that the Government has no duty to disclose those communications to the\nNation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion employs a fundamentally flawed legal premise.  We have never held that all of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s trust responsibilities to Indians must be set forth expressly in a specific statute or regulation.  To the contrary, where, as here, the statutory framework establishes that the relationship between the Government and an Indian tribe \xe2\x80\x9cbears the hallmarks of a conventional fiduciary relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Navajo II</em>, 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have consistently looked to general trust principles to flesh out the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/465/index.html">537 U. S. 465</a> (2003), we construed a statute that vested the Government with discretionary authority to \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d trust property for certain purposes as imposing a concomitant duty to preserve improvements that had previously been made to the land.  <em>Id.</em>, at 475 (quoting 74 Stat. 8).  Even though the statute did not \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly subject the Government to duties of management and conservation,\xe2\x80\x9d we construed the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the statute by reference to \xe2\x80\x9celementary trust law,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cconfirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary actually administering trust property may not allow it to fall into ruin on his watch.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 U. S., at 475<em>.</em>  Similarly, in <em>Seminole Nation</em>, we relied on general trust principles to conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to prevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt members of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or treaty provision expressly imposed such a duty.  See 316 U. S., at 296.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, although the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral \xe2\x80\x98contours\xe2\x80\x99 of the government\xe2\x80\x99s obligations\xe2\x80\x9d are defined by statute, the \xe2\x80\x9cin-terstices must be filled in through reference to general trust law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cobell</em>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1101 (quoting <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 224).  This approach accords with our recognition in other trust contexts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary function of the fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discretionary powers which are controlled by no other specific duty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Varity Corp.</em> v. <em>Howe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/489/index.html">516 U. S. 489</a>, 504 (1996) (emphasis deleted); cf. <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund</em> v. <em>Central Transport, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/559/index.html">472 U. S. 559</a>, 570 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ather than explicitly enumerating <em>all</em> of the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries, Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of their authority and responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more than activities already controlled by other specific legal duties, it would serve no purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howe</em>, 516 U.

But despite its assurance that it \xe2\x80\x9cwill apply common-law trust principles where Congress has indicated it is appropriate to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, the majority inexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust principles in this case.  In doing so, the majority states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he common law of trusts does not override the specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (referring to \xc2\xa7162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7115.801\xe2\x80\x93115.803).  That statement evidences the majority\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which common-law principles operate in the context of a conventional fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure obligations are not limited solely to the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly defined disclosure obligations\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in \xc2\xa7162a(d)(5) and its implementing regulations, <em>ante</em>, at 22; rather, given that the statutory regime requires the Government to act as a conventional fiduciary in managing Indian trust funds, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure obligations include those of a fiduciary under common-law trust principles.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9317.  Instead of \xe2\x80\x9coverrid[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the specific disclosure duty set forth in \xc2\xa7162a(d)(5) and its implementing regulations, general trust principles flesh out the Government\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure obligations under the broader statutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional fiduciary in this context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text of the very statute cited by the majority.  Section 162a(d), which was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108 Stat. 4239, sets forth eight \xe2\x80\x9ctrust responsibilities of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that provision also specifically states that the Secretary of the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproper discharge of the trust responsibilities of the United States shall include<em> (but are not limited to)</em>\xe2\x80\x9d those specified duties.  25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7162a(d) (emphasis added).  By expressly including the italicized language, Congress recognized that the Government has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out of the broader statutory scheme governing the management of Indian trust funds.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Indeed, Title I of the 1994 Act is entitled \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Recognition</em> of Trust Responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d 108 Stat. 4240 (emphasis added), and courts have similarly observed that the Act \xe2\x80\x9crecognized and reaffirmed \xe2\x80\xa6 that the government has longstanding and substantial trust obligations to Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cobell</em>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1098; see also H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 103\xe2\x80\x93778, p.\xc2\xa09 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe responsibility for management of Indian Trust Funds by the [Government] has been determined through a series of court decisions, treaties, and statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).  That conclusion accords with common sense as not even the Government argues that it had no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust funds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority requires the Nation to \xe2\x80\x9cpoint to a right conferred by statute\xe2\x80\x9d to the attorney-client communications at issue, <em>ante</em>, at 14, and finding none, denies the Nation access to those communications.  The upshot of that decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the position of the dissenting Justices in <em>White Mountain Apache</em> and <em>Mitchell II</em>, who rejected the use of common-law principles to inform the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes.  See <em>White Mountain Apache</em>, 537 U. S., at 486\xe2\x80\x93487 (Thomas, J., dissenting); <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 234\xe2\x80\x93235 (Powell, J., dissenting).  That approach was wrong when <em>Mitchell II</em> was decided nearly 30 years ago, and it is wrong today.  Under our governing precedents, common-law trust principles play an important role in defining the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary relationship.  Applying those principles in this context, I would hold that the fiduciary exception is fully applicable to the communications in this case.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have described the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duties toward Indian tribes as consisting of \xe2\x80\x9cmoral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust,\xe2\x80\x9d to be fulfilled through conduct \xe2\x80\x9cjudged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Seminole Nation</em>, 316 U. S., at 297; see also <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 225\xe2\x80\x93226 (collecting cases).  The sad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Government has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in managing Indian trust fund accounts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cobell</em>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1089 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe General Accounting Office, Interior Department Inspector General, and Office of Management and Budget, among others, have all condemned the mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the past twenty years\xe2\x80\x9d); Misplaced Trust 8 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he [Government\xe2\x80\x99s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian trust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exercise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expectations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Congress, and taxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 56 (\xe2\x80\x9c[H]ad this type of mismanagement taken place in any other trust arrangements such as Social Security, there would be war\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Congress has recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Indian trust fund is more than balance sheets and accounting procedures.  These moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native American tribes and a source of income to tens of thousands of native Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 5.  Given the history of governmental mismanagement of Indian trust funds, application of the fiduciary exception is, if anything, even more important in this context than in the private trustee context.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case deprives the Nation\xe2\x80\x94as well as the Indian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending in the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mismanagement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a\xe2\x80\x93138a\xe2\x80\x94of highly relevant information going directly to the merits of whether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary duties.  Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns expressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight and accountability that has marked the Government\xe2\x80\x99s handling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But perhaps even more troubling than the majority\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its disregard of our established precedents that affirm the central role that common-law trust principles play in defining the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes.  By rejecting the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s claim on the ground that it fails to identify a specific statutory right to the communications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an approach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of common-law principles altogether in the Indian trust context.  Its decision to do so in a case involving only a narrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse yet, risks further diluting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary obligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not intend and that would inflict serious harm on the already-frayed relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.  Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason for reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Solis </em>v. <em>Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.</em>, __ F.\xc2\xa03d __, 2011 WL 1663597, *4\xe2\x80\x935 (CA4 2011); <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Health Net, Inc.</em>, 482 F.\xc2\xa03d 225, 232\xe2\x80\x93234 (CA3 2007); <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Fiatallis North America, Inc.</em>, 401 F.\xc2\xa03d 779, 787\xe2\x80\x93788 (CA7 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mett</em>, 178 F.\xc2\xa03d 1058, 1062\xe2\x80\x931064 (CA9 1999); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Long Island Lighting Co.</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 268, 271\xe2\x80\x93272 (CA2 1997); <em>Wildbur </em>v. <em>ARCO Chemical Co.</em>, 974 F.\xc2\xa02d 631, 645 (CA5 1992); <em>Fausek </em>v. <em>White</em>, 965 F.\xc2\xa02d 126, 132\xe2\x80\x93133 (CA6 1992); see also Restatement (Third) of Trusts \xc2\xa782, Comment <em>f</em> and Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Notes on \xc2\xa782, pp. 187\xe2\x80\x93188, 198\xe2\x80\x93204 (2005); Restatement of Law (Third) Governing Lawyers \xc2\xa784 (1998).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, 25 U.

See <em>ibid.</em> (citing<em> Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C. </em>v. <em>Zimmer</em>, 355 A.\xc2\xa02d 709, 712 (Del. Ch. 1976)).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In <em>Nevada</em>, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation involving water rights even though it was also required by statute to represent the water rights of a reclamation project.  See 463 U. S., at 128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior \xe2\x80\x9cboth the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the commencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation lands\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cit is simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform its obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has obliged it to represent other interests as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  We thus observed in the context of that case that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government cannot follow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting interests without the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We expressly distinguished the context \xe2\x80\x9cwhere only a relationship between the Government and the tribe is involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 142.  In that context, we acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe law respecting obligations between a trustee and a beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects adequately describe the duty of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a></em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0To be sure, in decisions involving the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, we have explained that the jurisdictional analysis \xe2\x80\x9cmust train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Navajo I</em>, 537 U. S., at 506.  But even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that those jurisdictional decisions have relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express statutory provisions.  Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on general trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory scheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mitchell II</em>, 463 U. S., at 226 (noting that common-law trust sources establish that \xe2\x80\x9ca trustee is accountable in damages for breaches of trust\xe2\x80\x9d and that, \xe2\x80\x9c[g]iven the existence of a trust relationship, it naturally follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Navajo II</em>, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (affirming that general \xe2\x80\x9ctrust principles \xe2\x80\xa6 could play a role in inferring that the trust obligation is enforceable by damages\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that the \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d phrase (by which it means the \xe2\x80\x9cshall include (but are not limited to)\xe2\x80\x9d language) cannot be read to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts\xe2\x80\x9d because doing so would \xe2\x80\x9cimpose general obligations that would include those specifically enumerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  But the flaw in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that it misperceives the function of the relevant language.  Rather than serving as a \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d provision that affirmatively \xe2\x80\x9cincorporate[s]\xe2\x80\x9d common-law trust duties into \xc2\xa7162a(d), <em>ante</em>, at 22, that language simply makes clear that \xc2\xa7162a(d) does not set forth an exhaustive list of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s trust responsibilities in managing Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any substantive obligations into the statute.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority also contends that its reading of \xc2\xa7162a(d) is supported by a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96 Stat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected a claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide upon request \xe2\x80\x9cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa75(b), <em>id.</em>, at 1978.  According to the majority, this provision reflected Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from Indian tribes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22, n.\xc2\xa011.  But this provision cannot bear the weight the majority places on it.  Even putting aside the undisputed fact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents subject to the fiduciary exception are, under the \xe2\x80\x9creal client\xe2\x80\x9d rationale, <em>per se</em> nonprivileged.  See, <em>e.g., Mett</em>, 178 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1063.  Accordingly, if anything, the ICLA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Government disclose \xe2\x80\x9cnonprivileged\xe2\x80\x9d materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that Congress intended communications related to trust fund management to be disclosed to Indian tribes.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s errors are further compounded by its failure to accord proper consideration to the mandamus posture of this case.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis Court repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</em> v. <em>Mayacamas Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/271/index.html">485 U.

Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.  Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 380\xe2\x80\x93381 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; alterations deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority purports to leave the decision whether to grant mandamus relief to the Federal Circuit, but simultaneously drops a footnote stating that it \xe2\x80\x9cassume[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court of Federal Claims on remand will \xe2\x80\x9cfollow [its] holding\xe2\x80\x9d that the fiduciary exception is inapplicable here.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24, and n.\xc2\xa013.  By doing so, the majority virtually assures that the Nation will not be able to use the communications at issue in this litigation, thereby effectively granting extraordinary relief to the Government upon no showing whatsoever that the stringent conditions for mandamus have been met.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
