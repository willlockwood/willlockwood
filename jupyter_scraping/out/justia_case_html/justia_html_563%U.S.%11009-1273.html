V. SANTA CLARA COUNTY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ASTRA USA, INC., et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x931273.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 19, 2011\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 29, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">Section 340B of the Public Health Services Act imposes ceilings on prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to specified health care facilities (340B or covered entities), dominantly, local providers of medical care for the poor.  The \xc2\xa7340B ceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs.  To qualify for participation in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on their Medicaid drug purchases.  The amount of the rebates depends on a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d prices, as defined by legislation and regulation.  The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism.  The 340B Program also draws on the larger scheme\xe2\x80\x99s pricing methodology.  In the 340B Program\xe2\x80\x99s contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate Program.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered entity to reimburse that entity.  HRSA may also terminate the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for Medicaid coverage of its drugs.  Currently, HRSA handles overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secretary to develop formal procedures.  Once those procedures are in place, HRSA will reach an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d which will be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  In addition to authorizing compensation awards to overcharged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary penalties payable to the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical companies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in violation of the PPAs.  Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs\xe2\x80\x99 intended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for breach of contract.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B entities.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incompatible with the statutory regime.  As the County has conceded, covered entities have no right of action under \xc2\xa7340B itself.  Congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.  Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts enforceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries.  This argument overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 agreement to abide by them.  The agreements have no negotiable terms.  Like the Medicaid Rebate Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme.  A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself.  Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the \xc2\xa7340B ceiling price, not that they violated an independent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the County\xe2\x80\x99s would spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the Government.  But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the interdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program.  Suits by 340B entities would undermine the agency\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to administer these two programs harmoniously and uniformly.  Notably, the Medicaid Rebate Program\xe2\x80\x99s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for its drugs.  Had Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely would not have barred them from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit noted that HHS\xe2\x80\x99s Office of the Inspector General has reported on HRSA\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate enforcement authority.  But Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits.  Instead, Congress opted to strengthen and formalize HRSA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement authority, to make the new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities\xe2\x80\x99 complaints, and to render the agency\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of those complaints binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7256b (Oct. 2010 Supp.), imposes ceilings on prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to specified health care facilities.  Those facilities, here called \xe2\x80\x9c340B\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccovered\xe2\x80\x9d entities, include public hospitals and community health centers, many of them providers of safety-net services to the poor.  The \xc2\xa7340B ceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Drug manufacturers opt into the 340B Program by signing a form Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement (PPA) used nationwide.  PPAs are not transactional, bargained-for contracts.  They are uniform agreements that recite the responsibilities \xc2\xa7340B imposes, respectively, on drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS.  Manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 eligibility to participate in state Medicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into PPAs for covered drugs purchased by 340B entities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is conceded that Congress authorized no private right of action under \xc2\xa7340B for covered entities who claim they have been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.  This case presents the question whether 340B entities, though accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the statute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to which the manufacturers subscribed.  We hold that suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incompatible with the statutory regime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her designate, HRSA) in control of \xc2\xa7340B\xe2\x80\x99s drug-price prescriptions.  That control could not be maintained were potentially thousands of covered entities permitted to bring suits alleging errors in manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 price calculations.  If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it would make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form contract implementing the statute, setting out terms identical to those contained in the statute.  Though labeled differently, suits to enforce \xc2\xa7340B and suits to enforce PPAs are in substance one and the same.  Their treatment, therefore, must be the same, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o matter the clothing in which [340B entities] dress their claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tenet</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/1/index.html">544 U.

The PPAs \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically nam[e]\xe2\x80\x9d covered entities as the recipients of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the very object of the agreements is to ensure that those entities would be \xe2\x80\x9ccharge[d] \xe2\x80\xa6 no more than the ceiling price.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 33.

The form agreements, composed by HHS, contain no negotiable terms.  Like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreements, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, the 340B Program agreements serve as the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme.  A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself.  The absence of a private right to enforce the statutory ceiling price obligations would be rendered meaningless if 340B entities could overcome that obstacle by suing to enforce the contract\xe2\x80\x99s ceiling price obligations instead.  The statutory and contractual obligations, in short, are one and the same.  See <em>Grochowski </em>v. <em>Phoenix Construction</em>, 318 F.\xc2\xa03d 80, 86 (CA2 2003) (when\na government contract confirms a statutory obligation, \xe2\x80\x9ca third-party private contract action [to enforce that obligation] would be inconsistent with \xe2\x80\xa6 the legislative scheme \xe2\x80\xa6 to the same extent as would a cause of action directly under the statute\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the \xc2\xa7340B ceiling price, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Third Amended Complaint in No. 3:05\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9303740 (ND Cal.), \xc2\xb61, 65, not that they violated any independent substantive obligation arising only from the PPAs.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Repeatedly, the County acknowledged that \xc2\xa7340B is the source of the contractual term allegedly breached.

But Congress did not respond to the reports of inadequate HRSA enforcement by inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits in district courts across the country.
