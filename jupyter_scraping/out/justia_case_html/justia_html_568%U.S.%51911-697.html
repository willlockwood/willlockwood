Wiley Asia\xe2\x80\x99s books state that they are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edition English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States.  He then sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the profit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s unauthorized importation and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7106(3) exclusive right to distribute and \xc2\xa7602\xe2\x80\x99s import prohibition.  Kirtsaeng replied that because his books were \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made\xe2\x80\x9d and acquired legitimately, \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine permitted importation and resale without Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s further permission.  The District Court held that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine does not apply to goods manufactured abroad.  The jury then found that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s American copyrights and assessed damages.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d language indicated that the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted works manufactured abroad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad.

Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as imposing the non-geographical limitation made \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin compliance with\xe2\x80\x9d the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission.

Copyright Act).  This simple reading promotes the traditional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-word linguistic sense.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic difficulties.  Wiley first reads \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin conformance with the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wiley then argues that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis applicable\xe2\x80\x9d only in the United States.  However, neither \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d nor any other word in \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cwhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor can a geographical limitation be read into the word \xe2\x80\x9capplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that the Act does not instantly protect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad.  Indeed, \xc2\xa7602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies subject to the Copyright Act.  And \xc2\xa7104 says that works \xe2\x80\x9csubject to protection\xe2\x80\x9d include unpublished works \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to the [author\xe2\x80\x99s] nationality or domicile,\xe2\x80\x9d and works \xe2\x80\x9cfirst published\xe2\x80\x9d in any of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the United States.

A comparison of the language in \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion.  The former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who \xe2\x80\x9clawfully obtained\xe2\x80\x9d a copy, while the present version covers only owners of a \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made\xe2\x80\x9d copy.  This new language, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of a copy will not receive \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d protection but one who owns a copy will be protected, provided that the copy was \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made.\xe2\x80\x9d  A nongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions of the present statute.  For example, the \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing clause,\xe2\x80\x9d which limited importation of many copies printed outside the United States, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies made in America and copies made abroad.  But that \xe2\x80\x9cequal treatment\xe2\x80\x9d principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpretation that would grant an American copyright holder permanent control over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed abroad but not those printed in America.  Finally, the Court normally presumes that the words \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d carry the same meaning when they appear in different but related sections, and it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the consequences produced by a geographical interpretation.

Yousuf, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  The common-law \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, which has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical distinctions.

I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 8.  For example, a geographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely require libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books in their collections that were printed overseas.  Wiley counters that such problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court first adopted a geographical interpretation.  But the law has not been settled for so long in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Second Circuit in this case was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation.  Reliance on the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine is also deeply embedded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers, who have long relied on its protection.  And the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders to assert geographically based resale rights.  Thus, the practical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious, extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant\xe2\x80\x94particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade to America.

Thus, it might seem that, \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one who buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into the United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he bought the copy in the United States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut Quality King considered an instance in which the copy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufactured in the United States (and then sent abroad and sold).  This case is like Quality King but for one important fact.  The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.  That fact is important because \xc2\xa7109(a) says that the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine applies to \xe2\x80\x9ca particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  And we must decide here whether the five words, \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title,\xe2\x80\x9d make a critical legal difference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPutting section numbers to the side, we ask whether the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other lawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully manufactured abroad.

The Second Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, Wiley, and the Solicitor General (as amicus) all read those words as imposing a form of geographical limitation.  The Second Circuit held that they limit the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine to particular copies \xe2\x80\x9cmade in territories in which the Copyright Act is law,\xe2\x80\x9d which (the Circuit says) are copies \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured domestically,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9coutside of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  654 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 221\xe2\x80\x93222 (emphasis added).

And the Ninth Circuit has held that those words limit the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s applicability (1) to copies lawfully made in the United States, and (2) to copies lawfully made outside the United States but initially sold in the United States with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission.

And, despite an American copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission to make copies abroad, one who buys a copy of any such book or other copyrighted work\xe2\x80\x94whether at a retail store, over the Internet, or at a library sale\xe2\x80\x94could not resell (or otherwise dispose of) that particular copy without further permission.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKirtsaeng, however, reads the words \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d as imposing a non-geographical limitation.

In that case, \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine would apply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture met the requirements of American copyright law.  In particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here, copies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the copyright owner.  See \xc2\xa7106 (referring to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to authorize).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn our view, \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s language, its context, and the common-law history of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, taken together, favor a non-geographical interpretation.  We also doubt that Congress would have intended to create the practical copyright-related harms with which a geographical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly, artistic, commercial, and consumer activities.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93D, infra.  We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s nongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe language of \xc2\xa7109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s nongeographical interpretation, namely, that \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d means made \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cin compliance with\xe2\x80\x9d the Copyright Act.  The language of \xc2\xa7109(a) says nothing about geography.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d can mean \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n accordance with.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 Oxford English Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989).  See also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9caccording to\xe2\x80\x9d).  And a nongeographical interpretation provides each word of the five-word phrase with a distinct purpose.  The first two words of the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made,\xe2\x80\x9d suggest an effort to distinguish those copies that were made lawfully from those that were not, and the last three words, \xe2\x80\x9cunder this title,\xe2\x80\x9d set forth the standard of \xe2\x80\x9clawful[ness].\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the nongeograph- ical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright objective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word linguistic sense.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe geographical interpretation, however, bristles with linguistic difficulties.  It gives the word \xe2\x80\x9clawfully\xe2\x80\x9d little, if any, linguistic work to do.  (How could a book be unlawfully \xe2\x80\x9cmade under this title\xe2\x80\x9d?)  It imports geography into a statutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.  And it is far more complex than may at first appear.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec- ond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first emphasize the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, Wiley reads \xe2\x80\x9cunder this title\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin conformance with the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15.  Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis applicable\xe2\x80\x9d only in the United States.  Ibid.  And the Solicitor General must do the same.  See Brief for United States 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cA copy is \xe2\x80\x98lawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x99 if Title 17 governs the copy\xe2\x80\x99s creation and the copy is made in compliance with Title 17\xe2\x80\x99s requirements\xe2\x80\x9d).

It might mean \xe2\x80\x9csubject to,\xe2\x80\x9d see post, at 6, but as this Court has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a uniform, consistent meaning.  See Kucana v.

Where, precisely, is the Copyright Act \xe2\x80\x9capplicable\xe2\x80\x9d?  The Act does not instantly protect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking place abroad.

As a matter of ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing, say, a tariff upon \xe2\x80\x9cany rhododendron grown in Nepal\xe2\x80\x9d applies to all Nepalese rhododendrons.  And, similarly, one can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable to all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.  Indeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are \xe2\x80\x9csub- ject to\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  \xc2\xa7602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer- ring to importation of copies \xe2\x80\x9cthe making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if this title had been applicable\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for United States 5.

As we shall later describe, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93D, infra, without some such qualification a copyright holder could prevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving away copies of a video game made in Japan, a film made in Germany, or a dress (with a design copyright) made in China, even if the copyright holder has granted permission for the foreign manufacture, importation, and an initial domestic sale of the copy.  A publisher such as Wiley would be free to print its books abroad, allow their im- portation and sale within the United States, but prohibit students from later selling their used texts at a campus bookstore.  We see no way, however, to reconcile this half-geographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the language of the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  As a matter of English, it would seem that those five words either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they do not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, we believe that geographical interpretations create more linguistic problems than they resolve.

In respect to history, we compare \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s present language with the language of its immediate predecessor.  That predecessor said:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  Copyright Act of 1909, \xc2\xa741, \n\n35Stat.\n1084 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSee also Copyright Act of 1947, \xc2\xa727, \n\n61Stat.\n660.  The predecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does not argue that it does).  So we ask whether Congress, in changing its language implicitly introduced a geograph- ical limitation that previously was lacking.  See also Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law principle).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA comparison of language indicates that it did not.  The predecessor says that the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine protects \xe2\x80\x9cthe transfer of any copy the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  The present version says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\xe2\x80\x9d  What does this change in language accomplish?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe language of the former version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who \xe2\x80\x9clawfully obtained\xe2\x80\x9d a copy.  The present version covers only those who are owners of a \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made\xe2\x80\x9d copy.  Whom does the change leave out?  Who might have law- fully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned that copy?  One answer is owners of movie theaters, who during the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s (and before) often leased films from movie distributors or filmmakers.  See S. Donahue, American Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing producer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements); Note, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribution and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of Anti-Blind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L.\xc2\xa0J. 131, 135 (1986).  Because the theater owners had \xe2\x80\x9clawfully obtained\xe2\x80\x9d their copies, the earlier version could be read as allowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given them \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d protection.  Because the theater owners were lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in language makes clear that they (like bailees and other lessees) cannot take advantage of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.

Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of a copy will not receive \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d protection but one who owns a copy will receive \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d protection, provided, of course, that the copy was \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made\xe2\x80\x9d and  not pi- rated.  The new language also takes into account that a copy may be \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d when the copy, say of a phonorecord, comes into its owner\xe2\x80\x99s possession through use of a compulsory license, which \xe2\x80\x9cthis title\xe2\x80\x9d provides for elsewhere, namely, in \xc2\xa7115.  Again, for those who find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative report makes this clear.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x931476, p. 79 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, any resale of an illegally \xe2\x80\x98pirated\xe2\x80\x99 phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115 would not\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther provisions of the present statute also support a nongeographical interpretation.  For one thing, the stat- ute phases out the \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing clause,\xe2\x80\x9d a clause that appeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation of many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the United States.  \xc2\xa7601, \n\n90Stat.\n2588 (\xe2\x80\x9cPrior to July 1, 1982 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the importation into or public distribution in the United States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is prohibited unless the portions consisting of such material have been manufac- tured in the United States or Canada\xe2\x80\x9d).  The phasing out of this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manufactured in America and copies manufactured abroad.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

And it is particularly difficult to believe that Congress would have sought this unequal treatment while saying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the manufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of policy goal.

To interpret these words geographically would mean that one who buys a copyrighted work of art, a poster, or even a bumper sticker, in Canada, in Europe, in Asia, could not display it in America without the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s further authorization.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n(2) Section 109(e) specifically provides that the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted video arcade game \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly perform or display that game in coin-operated equipment\xe2\x80\x9d without the authorization of the copyright owner.

American law too has generally thought that competition, including freedom to resell, can work to the advantage of the consumer.  See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v.

Thus, it is not surprising that for at least a century the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine has played an important role in American copyright law.  See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.

Hence, Congress, the dissent believes, must have meant \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s different language to mean something different (such as the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s own geographical interpretation of \xc2\xa7109(a)).

For one thing, the law has not been settled for long in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The Second Circuit, in its decision below, is the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical interpretation.  The Third Circuit has favored a nongeographical interpretation.  Sebastian Int\xe2\x80\x99l, 847 F. 2d 1093.  The Ninth Circuit has favored a modified geographical interpretation with a nongeographical (but textually unsustainable) corollary designed to diminish the problem.  Denbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d 1143.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  And other courts have hesitated to adopt, and have cast doubt upon, the validity of the geographical interpretation.  Pearson Educ., Inc. v.

Museums, for example, are not in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to check with the heirs of copyright owners before sending, e.g., a Picasso on tour.  Brief for Association of Art Mu- seum Directors 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  That inertia means a dramatic change is likely necessary before these institutions, instructed by their counsel, would begin to engage in the complex permission-verifying process that a geographical interpretation would demand.  And this Court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of the geographical interpretation could provide that dramatic change.  These intolerable consequences (along with the absurd result that the copyright owner can ex- ercise downstream control even when it authorized the import or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth Circuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to adopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to mitigate these harms.  Brief for United States 27\xe2\x80\x9328; post, at 24\xe2\x80\x9328.  But those readings are not defensible, for they require too many unprecedented jumps over linguistic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.  See, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of \xc2\xa7106(3) \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly curtails the independent effect of \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so far to assert geographically based resale rights.  They may decide differently if the law is clarified in their favor. Regardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only if unenforced is not a sound copyright law.  It is a law that would create uncertainty, would bring about selective enforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disrespect for copyright law itself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, we believe that the practical problems that petitioner and his amici have described are too serious, too extensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss them as insignificant\xe2\x80\x94particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade to America.

(as visited Mar. 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).

That section says:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cImportation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono-records under section 106.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added).

We took as given the fact that the products at issue had at least once been sold.

Those advancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copyright Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provision, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies.  Qual- ity King, supra, at 146.  Thus, they said, \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) must prohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to allow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a first sale, as Quality King\xe2\x80\x99s holding would do, would leave \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) without much to prohibit.  It would become superfluous, without any real work to do.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not believe that this argument is a strong one.  Under Quality King\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) would still forbid importing (without permission, and subject to the exceptions in \xc2\xa7602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for example, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the licensee of an American publisher  prints copies of a book overseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send them to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other manufacturer (if not the \xe2\x80\x9cowner\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7109(a), e.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted goods to the United States; (3) \xe2\x80\x9ca book publisher transports copies to a wholesaler\xe2\x80\x9d and the wholesaler (not yet the owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright Law Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4) a foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri- bution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to send them to the United States.  See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on Copyright \xc2\xa78.12[B][1][a], at 8\xe2\x80\x93159 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 109(a) provides that the distribution right may be exercised solely with respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work, not to prevent or restrict the resale or other further transfer of possession of such copies\xe2\x80\x9d).  These examples show that \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) retains significance.  We concede it has less significance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the dissent also adopts a construction of \xc2\xa7106(3) that \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly curtails\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s effect, post, at 26, and so limits the scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater, degree.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Quality King we rejected the \xe2\x80\x9csuperfluous\xe2\x80\x9d argument for similar reasons.  But, when rejecting it, we said that, where an author gives exclusive American distribution rights to an American publisher and exclusive British distribution rights to a British publisher, \xe2\x80\x9cpresumably only those [copies] made by the publisher of the United States edition would be \xe2\x80\x98lawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of \xc2\xa7109(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 148 (emphasis added).  Wiley now argues that this phrase in the Quality King opinion means that books published abroad (under license) must fall outside the words \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d and that we have consequently already given those words the geographical interpretation that it favors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe cannot, however, give the Quality King statement the legal weight for which Wiley argues.  The language \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d was not at issue in Qual- ity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued; we did not canvas the considerations we have here set forth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example assumes a \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d; and we there hedged our state- ment with the word \xe2\x80\x9cpresumably.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most importantly, the statement is pure dictum.  It is dictum contained in a rebuttal to a counterargument.  And it is unnecessary dictum even in that respect.

For example, Irwin Karp, representing the Authors League of America asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIf a German jobber lawfully buys cop- ies from a German publisher, are we not running into the problem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained copies?\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., pt. 4, at 211.  The Copyright Office representative replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThis could vary from one situation to another, I guess.  I should guess, for example, that if a book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a wholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of transaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a draft, which, by explicitly referring to \xc2\xa7106, was similar to the provision that became law, now \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).  The Office noted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of a copy (without permission) \xe2\x80\x9cwould violate the exclusive rights of the U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright owner .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. where the copyright owner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign country for distribution only in that country.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., pt. 6, at 150.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill, that part of the report says nothing about the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine, about \xc2\xa7109(a), or about the five words, \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  And neither the report nor its accompanying 1960\xe2\x80\x99s draft answers the question before us here.  Cf. Quality King, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 145 (without those five words, the import clause, via its reference to \xc2\xa7106, imports the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut to ascertain the best reading of \xc2\xa7109(a), rather than dissecting the remarks of industry representatives concerning \xc2\xa7602 at congressional meetings held 10 years before the statute was enacted, see post, at 13\xe2\x80\x9316, we would give greater weight to the congressional report accompanying \xc2\xa7109(a), written a decade later when Congress passed the new law.

See, e.g., Copyright Law Revision, 1964 Revision Bill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5, p. 66 (Comm. Print 1965) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ull ownership of a lawfully-made copy authorizes its owner to dispose of it freely\xe2\x80\x9d).  It explains, as we have explained, the nongeographical purposes of the words \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, supra.  And it says nothing about geography.  Nor, importantly, did \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor provision.  See supra, at 12.  This means that, contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, any lack of legislative history pertaining to the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine only tends to bolster our position that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1976 revision did not intend to create a drastic geographical change in its revision to that provision.  See post, at 18, n. 13.  We consequently believe that the legislative history, on balance, supports the non- geographical interpretation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeographical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impos- sible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide foreign and domestic markets.  We concede that is so.  A publisher may find it more difficult to charge different prices for the same book in different geographic markets.  But we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can find no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that publishers are especially entitled to such rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Constitution describes the nature of American copyright law by providing Congress with the power to \xe2\x80\x9csecur[e]\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]uthors\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfor limited [t]imes\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive [r]ight to their .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [w]ritings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 8.  The Founders, too, discussed the need to grant an author a limited right to exclude competition.  Compare Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956) (arguing against any monopoly) with Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at 16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) (arguing for a limited monopoly to secure production).  But the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s language nowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should include a right to divide markets or a concomitant right to charge different purchasers different prices for the same book, say to increase or to maximize gain.  Neither, to our knowledge, did any Founder make any such suggestion.  We have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference for interpretations of copyright statutes that would provide for market divisions.  Cf. Copyright Law Revision, pt. 2, at 194 (statement of Barbara Ringer, Copyright Office) (division of territorial markets was \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily a matter of private contract\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo the contrary, Congress enacted a copyright law that (through the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine) limits copyright holders\xe2\x80\x99 ability to divide domestic markets.  And that limitation is consistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid market divisions.  Cf. Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46\n\xe2\x80\x9350 (1990) (per curiam) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]greements between competitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are illegal\xe2\x80\x9d).  Whether copyright owners should, or should not, have more than ordinary commercial power to divide international markets is a matter for Congress to decide.  We do no more here than try to determine what decision Congress has taken.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, the dissent and Wiley contend that our decision launches United States copyright law into an unprecedented regime of \xe2\x80\x9cinternational exhaustion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 18\xe2\x80\x9323; Brief for Respondent 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  But they point to nothing indicative of congressional intent in 1976.  The dissent also claims that it is clear that the United States now opposes adopting such a regime, but the Solicitor General as amicus has taken no such position in this case.  In fact, when pressed at oral argument, the Solicitor General stated that the consequences of Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute (perpetual downstream control) were \xe2\x80\x9cworse\xe2\x80\x9d than those of Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s reading (restriction of market segmentation).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.  And the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s position in Quality King is under- mined by his agreement in that case with our reading of \xc2\xa7109(a).  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Quality King, O. T. 1996, No. 1470, p.\xc2\xa030 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

But our holding in Quality King that \xc2\xa7109(a) is a defense in U.\xc2\xa0S. courts even when \xe2\x80\x9cthe first sale occurred abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 145, n.\xc2\xa014, has already significantly eroded such a principle.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons we conclude that the considerations supporting Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s nongeographical interpretation of the words \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d are the more persuasive.

Neither the text nor the history of \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7109(a) supports removing first-sale protection from every copy of a protected work manufactured abroad.  See ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x9316, 28\xe2\x80\x9331.  I recognize, however, that the combination of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision and Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\xe2\x80\x99anza Research Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 135 (1998)\n, constricts the scope of \xc2\xa7602(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on unauthorized importation.  I write to suggest that any problems associated with that limitation come not from our reading of \xc2\xa7109(a) here, but from Qual- ity King\xe2\x80\x99s holding that \xc2\xa7109(a) limits \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played an integral part in American copyright law for over a century.  See ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9319; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n\n210 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339 (1908)\n.  No codification of the doctrine prior to 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies made in the United States.  See ante, at 12.  And nothing in the text or history of \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x94the Copyright Act of 1976\xe2\x80\x99s first-sale provision\xe2\x80\x94suggests that Congress meant to enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley proposes, which at once would deprive American consumers of important rights and encourage copyright holders to manufacture abroad.  See ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x9316, 28\xe2\x80\x9331.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat said, John Wiley is right that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, when combined with Quality King, substantially narrows \xc2\xa7602(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on unauthorized importation.  Quality King held that the importation ban does not reach any copies receiving first-sale protection under \xc2\xa7109(a).  See 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 151\xe2\x80\x93152.  So notwithstanding \xc2\xa7602(a)(1), an \xe2\x80\x9cowner of a particular copy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. lawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d can import that copy without the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission.  \xc2\xa7109(a).  In now holding that copies \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d include copies manufactured abroad, we unavoidably diminish \xc2\xa7602(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s scope\xe2\x80\x94indeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications.  See ante, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if Congress views the shrinking of \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) as a problem, it should recognize Quality King\xe2\x80\x94not our decision today\xe2\x80\x94as the culprit.  Here, after all, we merely construe \xc2\xa7109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that \xc2\xa7109(a) limits \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).  Had we come out the opposite way in that case, \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner to restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the first-sale doctrine.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That result would enable the copyright owner to divide international markets in the way John Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).  But it would do so without imposing downstream liability on those who purchase and resell in the United States copies that happen to have been manu- factured abroad.  In other words, that outcome would tar- get unauthorized importers alone, and not the \xe2\x80\x9clibraries, used-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums\xe2\x80\x9d with whom the Court today is rightly concerned.  Ante, at 19.  Assuming Congress adopted \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I sus- pect that is how Congress thought the provision would work\xe2\x80\x94not by removing first-sale protection from every copy manufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here), but by enabling the copyright holder to control imports even when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King now prevents).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks us to misconstrue \xc2\xa7109(a) in order to restore \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) to its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright holders to segment international markets.  I think John Wiley may have a point about what \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) was designed to do; that gives me pause about Quality King\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation ban\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  But the Court today correctly declines the invitation to save \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) from Quality King by destroying the first-sale protection that \xc2\xa7109(a) gives to every owner of a copy manufactured abroad.  That would swap one (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make our reading of the statute only less reflective of Congressional intent.  If Congress thinks copyright owners need greater power to restrict importation and thus divide markets, a ready solution is at hand\xe2\x80\x94not the one John Wiley offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in Quality King.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Although Quality King concluded that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text foreclosed that outcome, see 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 151\xe2\x80\x93152, the Solicitor General offered a cogent argument to the contrary.  He reasoned that \xc2\xa7109(a) does not limit \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdispose\xe2\x80\x9d of copies\xe2\x80\x94not to import them: The Act\xe2\x80\x99s first-sale provision and its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping spheres of conduct.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Quality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96\xe2\x80\x931470, pp. 5, 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  That reading remains the Government\xe2\x80\x99s preferred way of construing the statute.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e think that we still would adhere to our view that section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section 602(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d); see also ante, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333; post, at 21, n.\xc2\xa015 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective of the first-sale doctrine\xe2\x80\x94i.e., reversing Quality King\xe2\x80\x94would yield a far more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting John Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s argument here.  That is because only the former approach turns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their place of manufacture.  To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley prints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain versions only in Thailand.  Without Quality King, John Wiley could do so\xe2\x80\x94i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and prevent anyone from importing them back into the United States.  But with Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its reading of \xc2\xa7109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-importing the books\xe2\x80\x94and so to segment the Thai market\xe2\x80\x94John Wiley would have to move its printing facilities abroad.  I can see no reason why Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s power to divide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970597">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x93697\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tSUPAP KIRTSAENG, dba BLUECHRISTINE99, PETITIONER v.

Their ability to engage in such price discrimination, however, is under- mined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies from low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.  The question in this case is whether the unauthorized importation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright infringement under U.

Code: \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7106(3), 109(a), and 602(a)(1).  Section 106 sets forth the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive rights\xe2\x80\x9d of a copyright owner, including the right \xe2\x80\x9cto distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7106(3).  This distribution right is limited by \xc2\xa7109(a), which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phono- record lawfully made under this title .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 109(a) codifies the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sale doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n\n210 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339\n\xe2\x80\x93351 (1908), which held that a copyright owner could not control the price at which retailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work.  The first sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner should not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over the distribution of copies of a copyrighted work.  At some point\xe2\x80\x94ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale\xe2\x80\x94the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right under \xc2\xa7106(3) to control the distribution of a particular copy is exhausted, and from that point forward, the copy can be resold or otherwise redistributed without the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V)\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x94last, but most critical, of the three copyright provisions bearing on this case\xe2\x80\x94is an importation ban.

The first sale doctrine would not provide the publisher of the British edition who decided to sell in the American market with a defense to an action under \xc2\xa7602(a) (or, for that matter, to an action under \xc2\xa7106(3), if there was a distribution of the copies).\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 148.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded, see 654 F.\xc2\xa03d 210, 221\xe2\x80\x93222 (CA2 2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a\xe2\x80\x9373a, application of the Quality King analysis to the facts of this case would preclude any invocation of \xc2\xa7109(a).

Ante, at 27.  Nevertheless, the Court dismisses this language, to which all Members of the Quality King Court subscribed, as ill-considered dictum.  Ante, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328.  I agree that the discussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essential to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  See Quality King, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 154 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not today resolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports were manufactured abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d).  But I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.  Instead, for the reasons explained below, I would hold, consistently with Quality King\xe2\x80\x99s dictum, that \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) authorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a copy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text of the Copyright Act demonstrates that Congress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent remedy against the importation of foreign-made copies of their copyrighted works.  As the Court recognizes, ante, at 3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7109(a).  In my view, that phrase is most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a copy\xe2\x80\x99s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance with, Title 17 of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.  This reading is consistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of similar language in other statutes.  See Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33\n\xe2\x80\x9353 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d in \n\n11 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71146(a), a Bankruptcy Code provision exempting certain asset transfers from stamp taxes, means \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d); Ardestani v.

The Copyright Act, it has been observed time and again, does not apply extraterritorially.  See United Dictionary Co. v. G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., \n\n208 U. S. 260, \n264 (1908)\n (copyright statute requiring that U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright notices be placed in all copies of a work did not apply to copies published abroad because U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright laws have no \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d beyond the United States\xe2\x80\x99 borders); 4 M.

The printing of Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-manufactured textbooks therefore was not governed by Title 17.  The textbooks thus were not \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under [Title 17],\xe2\x80\x9d the crucial precondition for application of \xc2\xa7109(a).  And if \xc2\xa7109(a) does not apply, there is no dispute that Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s conduct constituted copyright infringement under \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s point of departure is similar to mine.  According to the Court, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x99 means made \xe2\x80\x98in accordance with\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98in compliance with\xe2\x80\x99 the Copyright Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  But the Court overlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites, ante, at 9, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d commonly signals a relationship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regu- lated by another.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cinferior\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubordinate\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford English Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d means, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n accordance with (some regulative power or principle)\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  See also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d means, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cin .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a condition of sub- jection, regulation, or subordination\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csuffering restriction, restraint, or control by\xe2\x80\x9d).  Only by disregarding this established meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d can the Court arrive at the conclusion that Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-manufactured textbooks were \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under\xe2\x80\x9d U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright law, even though that law did not govern their creation.  It is anomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as \xe2\x80\x9clawful\xe2\x80\x9d under an inapplicable law.  For example, one might say that driving on the right side of the road in England is \xe2\x80\x9clawful\xe2\x80\x9d under U.\xc2\xa0S. law, but that would be so only because U.\xc2\xa0S. law has nothing to say about the subject.

Instead, it interprets \xc2\xa7109(a) as applying only to copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or would have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been applicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United States).

To the con- trary, it confirms what the plain text of the Act conveys: Congress intended \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) to provide copyright owners with a remedy against the unauthorized importation of foreign-made copies of their works, even if those copies were made and sold abroad with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F13" name="T13">\n\t\t\t\t\t13\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnlike the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, my position is consistent with the stance the United States has taken in international-trade negotiations.  This case bears on the highly con- tentious trade issue of interterritorial exhaustion.  The issue arises because intellectual property law is territorial in nature, see supra, at 6, which means that creators of intellectual property \xe2\x80\x9cmay hold a set of parallel\xe2\x80\x9d intellectual property rights under the laws of different nations.

Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 333, 340\xe2\x80\x93341 (2000) (hereinafter Chiappetta).  There is no international consensus on whether the sale in one country of a good in- corporating protected intellectual property exhausts the intellectual property owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to control the distribution of that good elsewhere.

One option is a national-exhaustion regime, under which a copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to control distribution of a particular copy is exhausted only within the country in which the copy is sold.  See Forsyth &amp; Rothnie, Parallel Imports, in The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and Competition Policy 429, 430 (S. Anderman ed. 2007) (hereinafter Forsyth &amp; Rothnie).  Another option is a rule of international exhaustion, under which the authorized distribution of a particular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s distribution right everywhere with respect to that copy.  See ibid.  The European Union has adopted the intermediate approach of regional exhaustion, under which the sale of a copy anywhere within the European Economic Area exhausts the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s distribution right throughout that region.  See id., at 430, 445.  Section 602(a)(1), in my view, ties the United States to a national-exhaustion framework.

See Chiappetta 360 (\xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable people making valid points can, and do, reach conflicting conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the desirability of international exhaustion).  International exhaustion subjects copyright-protected goods to competition from lower priced imports and, to that extent, benefits con- sumers.  Correspondingly, copyright owners profit from a national-exhaustion regime, which also enlarges the monetary incentive to create new copyrightable works.

Quality King, I acknowledge, discounted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about potential inconsistency with United States obligations under certain bilateral trade agreements.  See 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153\xe2\x80\x93154.  See also Quality King Brief 22\xe2\x80\x9324 (listing the agreements).  That decision, however, dealt only with copyright-protected products made in the United States.  See 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 154 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  Quality King left open the question whether owners of U.\xc2\xa0S. copyrights could retain control over the importation of copies manufactured and sold abroad\xe2\x80\x94a point the Court obscures, see ante, at 33 (arguing that Quality King \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly eroded\xe2\x80\x9d the national-exhaustion principle that, in my view, \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) embraces).  The Court today answers that question with a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d and in doing so, it risks undermining the United States\xe2\x80\x99 credibility on the world stage.  While the Government has urged our trading partners to refrain from adopting international-exhaustion regimes that could benefit consumers within their borders but would impact adversely on intellectual-property producers in the United States, the Court embraces an international-exhaustion rule that could benefit U.\xc2\xa0S. consumers but would likely disadvantage foreign holders of U.\xc2\xa0S. copyrights.

See also ante, at 18 (again referring to antitrust principles).  Section 602(a)(1), however, read as I do and as the Government does, simply facilitates copyright owners\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to impose \xe2\x80\x9cvertical restraints\xe2\x80\x9d on distributors of copies of their works.

See gener- ally Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 877 (2007)\n (discussing vertical restraints).  We have held that vertical restraints are not per\xc2\xa0se illegal under \xc2\xa71 of the Sherman Act, \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71, because such \xe2\x80\x9crestraints can have procompetitive effects.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881\xe2\x80\x93882.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F17" name="T17">\n\t\t\t\t\t17\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court sees many \xe2\x80\x9chorribles\xe2\x80\x9d following from a holding that the \xc2\xa7109(a) phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d does not encompass foreign-made copies.  Ante, at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).  If \xc2\xa7109(a) excluded foreign-made copies, the Court fears, then copyright owners could exercise perpetual control over the downstream distribution or public display of such copies.  A ruling in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s favor, the Court asserts, would shutter libraries, put used-book dealers out of business, cripple art museums, and prevent the resale of a wide range of consumer goods, from cars to calculators.

See also ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Kagan, J., concurring) (expressing concern about \xe2\x80\x9cimposing downstream liability on those who purchase and resell in the United States copies that happen to have been manufactured abroad\xe2\x80\x9d).  Copyright law and precedent, however, erect barriers to the anticipated horribles.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F18" name="T18">\n\t\t\t\t\t18\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1 \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRecognizing that foreign-made copies fall outside the ambit of \xc2\xa7109(a) would not mean they are forever free of the first sale doctrine.  As earlier observed, see supra, at 2, the Court stated that doctrine initially in its 1908 Bobbs-Merrill decision.  At that time, no statutory provision expressly codified the first sale doctrine.  Instead, copyright law merely provided that copyright owners had \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing, finishing, and vending\xe2\x80\x9d their works.  Copyright Act of 1891, \xc2\xa71, \n\n26Stat.\n1107.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Bobbs-Merrill, the Court addressed the scope of the statutory right to \xe2\x80\x9cven[d].\xe2\x80\x9d  In granting that right, the Court held, Congress did not intend to permit copyright owners \xe2\x80\x9cto fasten .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a restriction upon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one who had acquired full dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for it.\xe2\x80\x9d  210 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]ne who has sold a copyrighted article .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9chas parted with all right to control the sale of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 350.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purchaser of a book, once sold by authority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again, although he could not publish a new edition of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the logic of Bobbs-Merrill, the sale of a foreign-manufactured copy in the United States carried out with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization would exhaust the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to \xe2\x80\x9cvend\xe2\x80\x9d that copy.  The copy could thenceforth be resold, lent out, or otherwise redistributed without further authorization from the copyright owner.  Although \xc2\xa7106(3) uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cvend,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no reason to think Congress intended the word \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute\xe2\x80\x9d to bear a meaning different from the construction the Court gave to the word \xe2\x80\x9cvend\xe2\x80\x9d in Bobbs-Merrill.  See ibid. (emphasizing that the question before the Court was \xe2\x80\x9cpurely [one] of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F19" name="T19">\n\t\t\t\t\t19\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, in accord with Bobbs-Merrill, the first authorized distribution of a foreign-made copy in the United States exhausts the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s distribution right under \xc2\xa7106(3).  After such an authorized distribution, a library may lend, or a used-book dealer may resell, the foreign-made copy without seeking the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission.  Cf. ante, at 19\xe2\x80\x9321.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had imported into the United States and then sold the foreign-made textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7106(3) distribution right would have been exhausted under the rationale of Bobbs-Merrill.  Purchasers of the textbooks would thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished without first gaining a license from Wiley.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis line of reasoning, it must be acknowledged, significantly curtails the independent effect of \xc2\xa7109(a).  If, as I maintain, the term \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7106(3) incorporates the first sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x99s codification of that doctrine adds little to the regulatory regime.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F20" name="T20">\n\t\t\t\t\t20\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Section 109(a), however, does serve as a statutory bulwark against courts deviating from Bobbs-Merrill in a way that increases copyright owners\xe2\x80\x99 control over downstream distribution, and legislative history indicates that is precisely the role Congress intended \xc2\xa7109(a) to play.  Congress first codified the first sale doctrine in \xc2\xa741 of the Copyright Act of 1909, \n\n35Stat.\n1084.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F21" name="T21">\n\t\t\t\t\t21\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  It did so, the House Committee Report on the 1909 Act explains, \xe2\x80\x9cin order to make .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clear that [Congress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the construction to be given to the word \xe2\x80\x98vend.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909).  According to the Committee Report, \xc2\xa741 was \xe2\x80\x9cnot intended to change [existing law] in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The position I have stated and explained accords with this expression of congressional intent.  In enacting \xc2\xa741 and its successors, I would hold, Congress did not \xe2\x80\x9cchange . . . existing law,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., by stripping the word \xe2\x80\x9cvend\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus its substitute \xe2\x80\x9cdistribute\xe2\x80\x9d) of the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which I subscribe honors Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim in enacting \xc2\xa7109(a) while the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Act severely diminishes \xc2\xa7602(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s role.  See supra, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.  My position in no way tugs against the principle underlying \xc2\xa7109(a)\xe2\x80\x94i.e., that certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the owner\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7106(3) distribution right.  The Court, in contrast, fails to give meaningful effect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 manifest intent in \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) to grant copyright owners the right to control the importation of foreign-made copies of their works.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther statutory prescriptions provide further protection against the absurd consequences imagined by the Court.  For example, \xc2\xa7602(a)(3)(C) permits \xe2\x80\x9can organization operated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes\xe2\x80\x9d to import, without the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization, up to five foreign-made copies of a non-audiovisual work\xe2\x80\x94notably, a book\xe2\x80\x94for \xe2\x80\x9clibrary lending or archival purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  But cf. ante, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (suggesting that affirming the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision might prevent libraries from lending foreign-made books).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F22" name="T22">\n\t\t\t\t\t22\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also notes that amici representing art museums fear that a ruling in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s favor would prevent museums from displaying works of art created abroad.  Ante, at 22 (citing Brief for Association of Art Museum Directors et\xc2\xa0al.).  These amici observe that a museum\xe2\x80\x99s right to display works of art often depends on \n\n17 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7109(c).  See Brief for Association of Art Museum Directors et\xc2\xa0al. 11\xe2\x80\x9313.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F23" name="T23">\n\t\t\t\t\t23\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That provision addresses exhaustion of a copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right under \xc2\xa7106(5) to publicly display the owner\xe2\x80\x99s work.  Because \xc2\xa7109(c), like \xc2\xa7109(a), applies only to copies \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title,\xe2\x80\x9d amici contend that a ruling in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s favor would prevent museums from invoking \xc2\xa7109(c) with respect to foreign-made works of art.

Museums can, of course, seek the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission to display a work.  Furthermore, the sale of a work of art to a U.\xc2\xa0S. museum may carry with it an implied license to publicly display the work.  See 2 Patry \xc2\xa75:131, at\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x93280 (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts have noted the potential availability of an implied nonexclusive licens[e] when the circumstances .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. demonstrate that the parties intended that the work would be used for a specific purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d).

For example, the Court observes that a car might be programmed with diverse forms of software, the copyrights to which might be owned by individuals or entities other than the manu- facturer of the car.  Ibid.  Must a car owner, the Court asks, obtain permission from all of these various copyright owners before reselling her car?  Ibid.  Although this question strays far from the one presented in this case and briefed by the parties, principles of fair use and implied license (to the extent that express licenses do not exist) would likely permit the car to be resold without the copyright owners\xe2\x80\x99 authorization.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F25" name="T25">\n\t\t\t\t\t25\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMost telling in this regard, no court, it appears, has been called upon to answer any of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chorribles\xe2\x80\x9d in an actual case.  Three decades have passed since a federal court first published an opinion reading \xc2\xa7109(a) as applicable exclusively to copies made in the United States.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Scorpio Music Distributors, Inc., 569 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 47, 49 (ED Pa. 1983), summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 738 F.\xc2\xa02d 424 (CA3 1984) (table).  Yet Kirtsaeng and his supporting amici cite not a single case in which the owner of a consumer good authorized for sale in the United States has been sued for copyright infringement after reselling the item or giving it away as a gift or to charity.  The absence of such lawsuits is unsurprising.  Routinely suing one\xe2\x80\x99s customers is hardly a best business practice.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F26" name="T26">\n\t\t\t\t\t26\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Manufacturers, moreover, may be hesitant to do business with software programmers taken to suing consumers.

Ante, at 23.  Uncertainty generated by these conflicting decisions, the Court notes, may have deterred some copyright owners from pressing infringement claims.  Ante, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  But if, as the Court suggests, there are a multitude of copyright owners champing at the bit to bring lawsuits against libraries, art museums, and consumers in an effort to exercise perpetual control over the downstream distribution and public display of foreign-made copies, might one not expect that at least a handful of such lawsuits would have been filed over the past 30 years?  The absence of such suits indicates that the \xe2\x80\x9cpractical problems\xe2\x80\x9d hypothesized by the Court are greatly exaggerated.

Here, two congres- sional aims are evident.  First, in enacting \xc2\xa7602(a)(1), Con- gress intended to grant copyright owners permission to segment international markets by barring the importation of foreign-made copies into the United States.  Second, as codification of the first sale doctrine underscores, Congress did not want the exclusive distribution right conferred in \xc2\xa7106(3) to be boundless.  Instead of harmonizing these objectives, the Court subordinates the first entirely to the second.  It is unsurprising that none of the three major treatises on U.\xc2\xa0S. copyright law embrace the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of \xc2\xa7109(a).

That is not so.  My reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d signifies that the conduct at issue is the creation or manufacture of a copy.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1356 (1961) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cartificially produced by a manufacturing process\xe2\x80\x9d).  The word \xe2\x80\x9clawfully\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that for \xc2\xa7109(a) to apply, the copy\xe2\x80\x99s creation must have complied with some body of law.  Finally, the prepositional phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this title\xe2\x80\x9d clarifies what that body of law is\xe2\x80\x94namely, the copyright prescriptions contained in Title 17 of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Attempting to show that my reading of \xc2\xa7109(a) is susceptible to the same criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed \xe2\x80\x9cmanufacturing clause,\xe2\x80\x9d which required \xe2\x80\x9ccopies of a work consisting preponderantly of nondramatic literary material .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the English language\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured in the United States or Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d  Copyright Act of 1976, \xc2\xa7601(a), \n.  Because Congress expressly referred to manufacturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7109(a) cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.  This argument is a non sequitur.  I do not contend that the phrases \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d are interchangeable.  To repeat, I read the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title\xe2\x80\x9d as referring to instances in which a copy\xe2\x80\x99s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance with, Title 17 of the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.  See supra, at 6.  Not all copies \xe2\x80\x9cmanufactured in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d will satisfy this standard.  For example, piratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization are not \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under [Title 17].\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor would the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clawfully manufactured in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d be an exact substitute for \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  The making of a copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provision of law.  Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum wage.  The copy would be \xe2\x80\x9clawfully made under [Title 17]\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the copy\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the violation of the minimum-wage laws.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0When \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) was originally enacted in 1976, it played an additional role\xe2\x80\x94providing a private cause of action against importers of piratical goods.  See Quality King, 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146.  In 2008, however, Congress amended \xc2\xa7602 to provide for such a cause of action in \xc2\xa7602(a)(2), which prohibits the unauthorized \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mportation into the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either constituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have constituted an infringement of copyright if [Title 17] had been applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See PROIPA, \xc2\xa7105(b)(3), \n\xe2\x80\x934260.  Thus, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, the only conduct reached by \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) but not \xc2\xa7602(a)(2) is a nonowner\xe2\x80\x99s unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical copy.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Notably, the Court ignores the history of \xc2\xa7602(a)(1), which reveals that the primary purpose of the prescription was not to provide a remedy against rogue licensees, consignees, and bailees, against whom copyright owners could frequently assert breach-of-contract claims even in the absence of \xc2\xa7602(a)(1).  Instead, the primary purpose of \xc2\xa7602(a)(1) was to reach third-party importers, enterprising actors like Kirtsaeng, against whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to lack of privity.

See ante, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprotection under this title\xe2\x80\x9d afforded by \xc2\xa7104, however, is merely protection against infringing conduct within the United States, the only place where Title 17 applies.  See 4 W. Patry, Copyright \xc2\xa713:44.10, pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x93128 to 13\xe2\x80\x93129 (2012) (hereinafter Patry).  Thus, my reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cunder this title\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7109(a) is consistent with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of that phrase in \xc2\xa7104.  Furthermore, \xc2\xa7104 describes which works are entitled to copyright protection under U.\xc2\xa0S. law.  But no one disputes that Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s copyrights in the works at issue in this case are valid.  The only question is whether Kirtsaeng\xe2\x80\x99s importation of copies of those works infringed Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s copyrights.  It is basic to copyright law that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]wnership of a copyright .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n.  See also \xc2\xa7101 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Copies\xe2\x80\x99 are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\xe2\x80\x9d).

There can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were published and first sold in the United States.  See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 139 F. 155, 157 (CC SDNY 1905) (the publisher claiming copy-right infringement in Bobbs-Merrill was incorporated and had its principal office in Indiana).  See also Copyright Act of 1891, \xc2\xa73, \n\xe2\x80\x931108 (generally prohibiting importation, even by the copyright owner, of foreign-manufactured copies of copyrighted books); 4 Patry \xc2\xa713:40, at\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x93111 (under the Copyright Act of 1891, \xe2\x80\x9ccopies of books by both foreign and U.\xc2\xa0S. authors had to be printed in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  But cf. ante, at 18 (asserting, without acknowledging the 1891 Copyright Act\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition against the importation of foreign-made copies of copyrighted books, that the Court is unable to find any \xe2\x80\x9cgeographical distinctions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in Bobbs-Merrill\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, exhaustion occurs under Bobbs-Merrill only when a copy is distributed within the United States with the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission, not when it is distributed abroad.  But under \xc2\xa7109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any authorized distribution of a U.\xc2\xa0S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in a foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner\xe2\x80\x99s distribution right under \xc2\xa7106(3).  See 523 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 145, n.\xc2\xa014.  Section 109(a) therefore provides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T21" name="F21">21</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, however, prevents copyright owners from barring the importation of such low-priced copies into the United States, where they will compete with the higher priced editions copyright owners make available for sale in this country.  To protect their profit margins in the U.\xc2\xa0S. market, copyright owners may raise prices in less developed countries or may withdraw from such markets altogether.
