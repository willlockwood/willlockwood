V. BROUDO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">DURA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., et al. <em>v.</em> BROUDO et al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x93932.Argued January 12, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided April 19, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Respondents filed a securities fraud class action, alleging that petitioners, Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and some of its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura), made, <em>inter alia,</em> misrepresentations about future Food and Drug Administration approval of a new asthmatic spray device, leading respondents to purchase Dura securities at an artificially inflated price.  In dismissing, the District Court found that the complaint failed adequately to allege \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> a causal connection between the spray device misrepresentation and the economic loss, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(4).  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that a plaintiff can satisfy the loss causation requirement simply by alleging that a security\xe2\x80\x99s price at the time of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0An inflated purchase price will not by itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss needed to allege and prove \xe2\x80\x9closs causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The basic elements of a private securities fraud action\xe2\x80\x94which resembles a common-law tort action for deceit and misrepresentation\xe2\x80\x94include, as relevant here, economic loss and \xe2\x80\x9closs causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit erred in following an inflated purchase price approach to showing causation and loss.  First, as a matter of pure logic, the moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss because the inflated purchase price is offset by ownership of a share that possesses equivalent value at that instant.  And the logical link between the inflated purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong, since other factors may affect the price.  Thus, the most logic alone permits this Court to say is that the inflated purchase price suggests that misrepresentation \xe2\x80\x9ctouches upon\xe2\x80\x9d a later economic loss, as the Ninth Circuit found.  However, to touch upon a loss is not to cause</em> a loss, as 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(4) requires.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding also is not supported by precedent.  The common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions that private securities fraud actions resemble require a plaintiff to show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted, but also that he suffered actual economic loss.  Nor can the holding below be reconciled with the views of other Courts of Appeals, which have rejected the inflated purchase price approach to showing loss causation.  Finally, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach is inconsistent with an important securities law objective.  The securities laws make clear Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to permit private securities fraud actions only where plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of cause and loss, but the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach would allow recovery where a misrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price, but does not proximately cause any economic loss.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint was legally insufficient in respect to its allegation of \xe2\x80\x9closs causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8(a)(2) requires only a \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\xe2\x80\x9d and while the Court assumes that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes place any further requirement in respect to the pleading, the \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement\xe2\x80\x9d must give the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice of what the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a>, 47.  The complaint here contains only respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegation that their loss consisted of artificially inflated purchase prices.  However, as this Court has concluded here, such a price is not itself a relevant economic loss.  And the complaint nowhere else provides Dura with notice of what the relevant loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation.  Ordinary pleading rules are not meant to impose a great burden on a plaintiff, but it should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff suffering economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.  Allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause would bring about the very sort of harm the securities statutes seek to avoid, namely the abusive practice of filing lawsuits with only a faint hope that discovery might lead to some plausible cause of action.

We consider a Ninth Circuit holding that a plaintiff can satisfy this requirement\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that courts call \xe2\x80\x9closs causation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94simply by alleging in the complaint and subsequently establishing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe price\xe2\x80\x9d of the security \xe2\x80\x9c<em>on the date of purchase</em> was inflated because of the misrepresentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 F.\xc2\xa03d 933, 938 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In our view, the Ninth Circuit is wrong, both in respect to what a plaintiff must prove and in respect to what the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint here must allege.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents are individuals who bought stock in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., on the public securities market between April 15, 1997, and February 24, 1998.  They have brought this securities fraud class action against Dura and some of its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura) in federal court.  In respect to the question before us, their detailed amended (181 paragraph) complaint makes substantially the following allegations:</p>\n<p align="left">(1)Before and during the purchase period, Dura (or its officials) made false statements concerning both Dura\xe2\x80\x99s drug profits and future Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a new asthmatic spray device.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 45a, 55a, 89a.</p>\n<p>\n\n(2)In respect to drug profits, Dura falsely claimed that it expected that its drug sales would prove profitable.  See, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 66a\xe2\x80\x9369a.</p>\n<p>\n\n(3)In respect to the asthmatic spray device, Dura falsely claimed that it expected the FDA would\nsoon grant its approval.  See, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 89a\xe2\x80\x9390a, 103a\xe2\x80\x93104a.</p>\n<p>\n\n(4)On the last day of the purchase period, February 24, 1998, Dura announced that its earnings would be lower than expected, principally due to slow drug sales.  <em>Id.,</em> at 51a.</p>\n<p>\n\n(5)The next day Dura\xe2\x80\x99s shares lost almost half their value (falling from about $39 per share to about $21).  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>(6)About eight months later (in November 1998), Dura announced that the FDA would not approve Dura\xe2\x80\x99s new asthmatic spray device.  <em>Id.,</em> at 110a.</p>\n<p>\n\n(7)The next day Dura\xe2\x80\x99s share price temporarily fell but almost fully recovered within one week.  <em>Id.,</em> at 156a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most importantly, the complaint says the following (and nothing significantly more than the following) about economic losses attributable to the spray device misstatement: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn reliance on the integrity of the market, [the plaintiffs] \xe2\x80\xa6 paid artificially inflated prices for Dura securities\xe2\x80\x9d and the plaintiffs suffered \xe2\x80\x9cdamage[s]\xe2\x80\x9d thereby.</em> <em>Id.,</em> at 139a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court dismissed the complaint.  In respect to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 drug-profitability claim, it held that the complaint failed adequately to allege an appropriate state of mind, <em>i.e.</em>, that defendants had acted knowingly, or\nthe like.  In respect to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 spray device claim, it held that the complaint failed adequately to allege \xe2\x80\x9closs causation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  In the portion of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision now before us\xe2\x80\x94the portion that concerns the spray device claim\xe2\x80\x94the Circuit held that the complaint adequately alleged \xe2\x80\x9closs causation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Circuit wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiffs establish loss causation if they have shown that the price <em>on the date of purchase </em>was inflated because of the misrepresentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 938 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).  It added that \xe2\x80\x9cthe injury occurs at the time of the transaction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Since the complaint pleaded \xe2\x80\x9cthat the price at the time of purchase was overstated,\xe2\x80\x9d and it sufficiently identified the cause, its allegations were legally sufficient.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s views about loss causation differ from those of other Circuits that have considered this issue, we granted Dura\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari.  Compare <em>ibid. </em>with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Emergent Capital Investment Management, LLC</em> v. <em>Stonepath Group</em>, <em>Inc.</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 189, 198 (CA2 2003); <em>Semerenko</em> v. <em>Cendant Corp.</em>, 223 F.\xc2\xa03d 165, 185 (CA3 2000); <em>Robbins</em> v.<em> Koger Properties, Inc.</em>, 116 F. 3d 1441, 1447\xe2\x80\x931448 (CA11 1997); cf. <em>Bastian</em> v. <em>Petren Resources Corp.</em>, 892 F. 2d 680, 685 (CA7 1990).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Private federal securities fraud actions are based upon federal securities statutes and their implementing regulations.  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 forbids (1) the \xe2\x80\x9cuse or employ[ment] \xe2\x80\xa6 of any \xe2\x80\xa6 deceptive device,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cin contravention of\xe2\x80\x9d Securities and Exchange Commission \xe2\x80\x9crules and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Blue Chip Stamps</em> v. <em>Manor Drug Stores,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/index.html">421 U.

T. Hazen, Law of Securities Regulation, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712.11[1], [3] (5th ed. 2002).</p>\n<p align="left">\nDura argues that the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are inadequate in respect to these last two elements.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s basic reason for finding the complaint adequate, namely, that at the end of the day plaintiffs need only \xe2\x80\x9cestablish,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, prove, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe price<em> on the date of purchase</em> was inflated because of the misrepresentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  339 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In our view, this statement of the law is wrong.  Normally, in cases such as this one (<em>i.e.</em>, fraud-on-the-market cases), an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, as a matter of pure logic, at the moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss; the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership of a share that <em>at that instant </em>possesses equivalent value.  Moreover, the logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong.  Shares are normally purchased with an eye toward a later sale.  But if, say, the purchaser sells the shares quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out, the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss.  If the purchaser sells later after the truth makes its way into the market place, an initially inflated purchase price <em>might </em>mean a later loss.  But that is far from inevitably so.  When the purchaser subsequently resells such shares, even at a lower price, that lower price may reflect, not the earlier misrepresentation, but changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events, which taken separately or together account for some or all of that lower price.  (The same is true in respect to a claim that a share\xe2\x80\x99s higher price is lower than it would otherwise have been\xe2\x80\x94a claim we do not consider here.)  Other things being equal, the longer the time between purchase and sale, the more likely that this is so, <em>i.e.</em>, the more likely that other factors caused the loss.</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the tangle of factors affecting price, the most logic alone permits us to say is that the higher purchase price will <em>sometimes </em>play a role in bringing about a future loss. It may prove to be a necessary condition of any such loss, and in that sense one might say that the inflated purchase price suggests that the misrepresentation (using language the Ninth Circuit used) \xe2\x80\x9ctouches upon\xe2\x80\x9d a later economic loss.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But, even if that is so, it is insufficient. To \xe2\x80\x9ctouch upon\xe2\x80\x9d a loss is not to <em>cause</em> a loss, and it is the latter that the law requires.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding lacks support in precedent.  Judicially implied private securities-fraud actions resemble in many (but not all) respects common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions.  See <em>Blue Chip Stamps, supra</em>, at 744; see also L. Loss &amp; J. Seligman, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation, 910\xe2\x80\x93918 (5th ed. 2004) (describing relationship to common-law deceit).  The common law of deceit subjects a person who \xe2\x80\x9cfraudulently\xe2\x80\x9d makes a \xe2\x80\x9cmisrepresentation\xe2\x80\x9d to liability \xe2\x80\x9cfor pecuniary loss caused\xe2\x80\x9d to one who justifiably relies upon that misrepresentation.  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7525, p. 55 (1977) (hereinafter Restatement of Torts); see also <em>Southern Development Co.</em> v. <em>Silva,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/125/247/index.html">125 U. S. 247</a>, 250 (1888) (setting forth elements of fraudulent misrepresentation).  And the common law has long insisted that a plaintiff in such a case show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted but also that he suffered actual economic loss.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pasley</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, 3 T.\xc2\xa0R. 5:1, 100 Eng. Rep. 450, 457 (1789) (if \xe2\x80\x9cno injury is occasioned by the lie, it is not actionable: but if it be attended with a damage, it then becomes the subject of an action\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Venner</em>, 120 Mass. 424, 426 (1876) (a mortgagee cannot bring a tort action for damages stemming from a fraudulent note that a misrepresentation led him to execute unless and until the note has to be paid); see also M. Bigelow, Law of Torts 101 (8th ed. 1907) (damage \xe2\x80\x9cmust already have been suffered before the bringing of the suit\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 T. Cooley, Law of Torts \xc2\xa7348, p. 551 (4th ed. 1932) (plaintiff must show that he \xe2\x80\x9csuffered damage\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9cdamage followed proximately the deception\xe2\x80\x9d); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa7110, p. 765 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cmust have suffered substantial damage,\xe2\x80\x9d not simply nominal damages, before  \xe2\x80\x9cthe cause of action can arise\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the common-law roots of the securities fraud action (and the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show actual damages), it is not surprising that other courts of appeals have rejected the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinflated purchase price\xe2\x80\x9d approach to proving causation and loss.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Emergent Capital</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 198 (inflation of purchase price alone cannot satisfy loss causation); <em>Semerenko</em>, 223 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 185 (same); <em>Robbins</em>, 116 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1448 (same); cf. <em>Bastian</em>, 892 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 685.  Indeed, the Restatement of Torts, in setting forth the judicial consensus, says that a person who \xe2\x80\x9cmisrepresents the financial condition of a corporation in order to sell its stock\xe2\x80\x9d becomes liable to a relying purchaser \xe2\x80\x9cfor the loss\xe2\x80\x9d the purchaser sustains \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the facts \xe2\x80\xa6 become generally known\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cas a result\xe2\x80\x9d share value \xe2\x80\x9cdepreciate[s].\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7548A, Comment <em>b,</em> at 107.  Treatise writers, too, have emphasized the need to prove proximate causation.  Prosser and Keeton \xc2\xa7110, at 767 (losses do \xe2\x80\x9cnot afford any basis for recovery\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cbrought about by business conditions or other factors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cannot reconcile the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinflated purchase price\xe2\x80\x9d approach with these views of other courts.  And the uniqueness of its perspective argues against the validity of its approach in a case like this one where we consider the contours of a judicially implied cause of action with roots in the common law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach overlooks an important securities law objective.  The securities statutes seek to maintain public confidence in the marketplace.<em> </em>See<em> United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Hagan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/642/index.html">521 U. S. 642</a>, 658 (1997).  They do so by deterring fraud, in part, through the availability of private securities fraud actions.  <em>Randall</em> v. <em>Loftsgaarden,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/647/index.html">478 U. S. 647</a>, 664 (1986).  But the statutes make these latter actions available, not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.

There is no support in the Securities Exchange Act, the Rule, or our cases for such a result\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory provision at issue here and the paragraphs that precede it emphasize this last mentioned objective.  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737.  The statute insists that securities fraud complaints \xe2\x80\x9cspecify\xe2\x80\x9d each misleading statement; that they set forth the facts \xe2\x80\x9con which [a] belief\xe2\x80\x9d that a statement is misleading was \xe2\x80\x9cformed\xe2\x80\x9d; and that they \xe2\x80\x9cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(1), (2).  And the statute expressly imposes on plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden\nof proving\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations \xe2\x80\x9ccaused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute thereby makes clear Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to permit private securities fraud actions for recovery where, but only where, plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of causation and loss.  By way of contrast, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach would allow recovery where a misrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price but nonetheless does not proximately cause any economic loss.  That is to say, it would permit recovery where these two traditional elements in fact are missing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we find the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach inconsistent with the law\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a plaintiff prove that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation (or other fraudulent conduct) proximately caused the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s economic loss.  We need not, and do not, consider other proximate cause or loss-related questions.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding about plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 need to <em>prove</em> proximate causation and economic loss leads us also to conclude that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 complaint here failed adequately to <em>allege</em> these requirements.  We concede that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require only \xe2\x80\x9ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).  And we assume, at least for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes impose any special further requirement in respect to the pleading of proximate causation or economic loss.  But, even so, the \xe2\x80\x9cshort and plain statement\xe2\x80\x9d must provide the defendant with \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice of what the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Conley</em> v. <em>Gibson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/index.html">355 U. S. 41</a>, 47 (1957).  The complaint before us fails this simple test.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have pointed out, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lengthy complaint contains only one statement that we can fairly read as describing the loss caused by the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cspray device\xe2\x80\x9d misrepresentations.  That statement says that the plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9cpaid artificially inflated prices for Dura\xe2\x80\x99s securities\xe2\x80\x9d and suffered \xe2\x80\x9cdamage[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 139a.  The statement implies that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 loss consisted of the \xe2\x80\x9cartificially inflated\xe2\x80\x9d purchase \xe2\x80\x9cprices.\xe2\x80\x9d  The complaint\xe2\x80\x99s failure to claim that Dura\xe2\x80\x99s share price fell significantly after the truth became known suggests that the plaintiffs considered the allegation of purchase price inflation alone sufficient.  The complaint contains nothing that suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For reasons set forth in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>, however, the \xe2\x80\x9cartificially inflated purchase price\xe2\x80\x9d is not itself a relevant economic loss.  And the complaint nowhere else provides the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation concerning Dura\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspray device.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concede that ordinary pleading rules are not meant to impose a great burden upon a plaintiff.<font b="1" i="1"> <em>Swierkiewicz v.

At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about harm of the very sort the statutes seek to avoid.
