After argument, judgment was rendered in his favor.</p>\n<p>The defendant thereupon sued out this writ.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>All the questions presented for our consideration by this record relate to the validity of bonds issued by the Town of Lyons in payment for railroad stock subscribed by its proper authorities.</p>\n<p>Propositions covering the entire ground of the controversy between the parties have been so frequently decided by this Court that any extended examination of the case is unnecessary.  <em>Orleans v. Platt, supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/99/676/case.html">99 U. S. 676</a></span>, our last adjudication of this class, is conclusive in favor of affirming the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p>The county judge unquestionably had jurisdiction to decide upon the application made by the taxpayers.  His judgment until reversed was final.  If there were errors, the proceedings should have been brought before a higher court for review by a writ of certiorari, and if need be, the issuing and circulation of the bonds should have been enjoined, subject to the final result of the litigation.  The judgment rendered can no more be collaterally attacked in this case than could any other judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 99 U. S. 686</a></p><p> of a court of competent jurisdiction rendered with the parties, as in this properly before it.  The recital in the bonds sets forth the judgment of the county judge, that it was duly rendered, that the bonds were issued pursuant to the statutes referred to, for the object specified in the petition of the taxpayers, and by persons properly appointed and charged by law with the duty of subscribing for the stock and issuing the bonds to pay for it.</p>\n<p>The sufficiency of the statutory authority under which the proceedings were had is not denied.</p>\n<p>Under such circumstances, the recital is an estoppel.  A <em>bona fide</em> holder of the bonds was not bound to look further, and the obligor cannot go behind it.  <em>Orleans v.
