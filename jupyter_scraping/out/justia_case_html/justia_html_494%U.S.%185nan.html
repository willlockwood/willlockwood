The defendants, C. Tom Carden and Leonard L. Limes, citizens of Louisiana, moved to dismiss, contending that one of Arkoma\'s limited partners was also. a citizen of Louisiana.  The District Court denied the motion, but certified the question for interlocutory appeal, which the Fifth Circuit declined.  Thereafter Magee Drilling Company intervened in the suit and, together with the original defendants, counterclaimed against Arkoma under Texas law.  Following a bench trial, the District Court awarded Arkoma a money judgment plus interest and attorney\'s fees; it dismissed Carden and Limes\' counterclaim and as well as Magee\'s intervention and counterclaim.  Carden, Limes, and Magee (petitioners here) appealed, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="187">Page 494 U. S. 187</a></p><p> 874 F.2d 226 (CA 5 1988).  With respect to petitioners\' jurisdictional challenge, the Court of Appeals found complete diversity, reasoning that Arkoma\'s citizenship should be determined by reference to the citizenship of the general, but not the limited, partners.  We granted certiorari.  490 U.S. 1045, (1989).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>Article III of the Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that "The judicial Power shall extend to . . . Controversies . . . between Citizens of different States."  Congress first authorized the federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction in the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, \xc2\xa7 11, 1 Stat. 78.  In its current form, the diversity statute provides that\n</em></p>\n<p>"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds . . . $50,000 . . . , and is between . . . citizens of different States. . . ."</p>\n<p>28 U.S. C.A. \xc2\xa7 1332(a) (Oct. 1989 Supp.).  Since its enactment, we have interpreted the diversity statute to require "complete diversity" of citizenship.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/7/267/case.html">Strawbridge v. Curtiss,</a></span></em> 3 Cranch 267, (1806).  The District Court erred in finding complete diversity in this case unless (1) a limited partnership may be considered in its own right a "citizen" of the State that created it, or (2) a federal court must look to the citizenship of only its general, but not its limited, partners to determine whether there is complete diversity of citizenship.  We consider these questions in turn.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We have often had to consider the status of artificial entities created by state law insofar as that bears upon the existence of federal diversity jurisdiction.  The precise question posed under the terms of the diversity statute is whether such an entity may be considered a "citizen" of the State under whose laws it was created. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  A corporation is the paradigmatic </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 494 U. S. 188</a></p><p> artificial "person," and the Court has considered its proper characterization under the diversity statute on more than one occasion -- not always reaching the same conclusion.  Initially, we held that a corporation "is certainly not a citizen," so that to determine the existence of diversity jurisdiction the Court must "look to the character of the individuals who compose [it]."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html">Bank of United States v.

Ten years later, we reaffirmed the result of <em>Letson,</em> though on the somewhat different theory that "those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it," should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation\'s State of incorporation.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html">Marshall v.

The allegation of the amended petition is that the United States Express Company is a joint stock company organized under a law of the State of New York, and is a citizen of that State.  But the express company cannot be a <em>citizen</em> of New York, within the meaning of the statutes regulating jurisdiction, unless it be a corporation.  The allegation that the company was <em>organized</em> under the laws of New York is not an allegation that it is a corporation.  In fact, the allegation is that the company is <em>not</em> a corporation, but a joint stock company -- that is, a mere partnership."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/129/677/case.html#682">129 U.

S. 449</a></span> (1900), we held that a "limited partnership association" -- although possessing "some of the characteristics of a corporation" and deemed a "citizen" by the law creating it -- may not be deemed a "citizen" under the jurisdictional rule established for corporations.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/177/449/case.html#456">177 U.

Arkoma fairly argues that this language, and the outcome of the case,</p>\n<p>"reflec[t] the Supreme Court\'s willingness to look beyond the incorporated/unincorporated dichotomy and to study the internal organization, state law requirements, management structure, and capacity or lack thereof to act and/or sue, to determine diversity of citizenship."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondent 14.  The problem with this argument lies not in its logic, but in the fact that the approach it espouses was proposed and specifically rejected in <em>Bouligny.</em>  There, in reaffirming "the doctrinal wall of <em>Chapman v. Barney,</em>" we explained <em>Russell</em> as a case resolving the distinctive problem "of fitting an exotic creation of the civil law . . . into a federal scheme which knew it not."  382 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html#151">382 U. S. 151</a></span>.  There could be no doubt, after <em>Bouligny,</em> that at least common law entities (and likely all entities beyond the Puerto Rican <em>sociedad en comandita</em>) would be treated for purposes of the diversity statute pursuant to what <em>Russell</em> called "[t]he tradition of the common law," which is "to treat as legal persons only incorporated groups and to assimilate all others to partnerships."  288 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/476/case.html#480">288 U.

Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html">446 U. S. 458</a></span> (1980).  That case, however, did not involve the question whether a party that is an artificial entity other than a corporation can be considered a "citizen" of a State, but the quite separate question whether parties that were undoubted "citizens" (<em>viz.,</em> natural persons) were the real parties to the controversy.  The plaintiffs in <em>Navarro</em> were eight individual trustees of a Massachusetts business trust, suing in their own names.  The defendant, Navarro Savings Association, disputed the existence of complete diversity, claiming that the trust beneficiaries, rather than the trustees, were the real parties to the controversy, and that the citizenship of the former and not the latter should therefore control.  In the course of rejecting this claim, we did indeed discuss the characteristics of a Massachusetts business trust -- not at all, however, for the purpose of determining whether the trust had attributes making it a "citizen," but only for the purpose of establishing that the respondents were "active trustees whose control over the assets held in their names is real and substantial," thereby bringing them under the rule, "more than 150 years" old, which permits such trustees "to sue in their own right, without regard to the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#465">446 U. S. 465</a></span>-466.  Navarro, in short, has nothing to do with the <em>Chapman</em> question, except that it makes available to respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 494 U. S. 192</a></p><p> the argument by analogy that, just as business reality is taken into account for purposes of determining whether a trustee is the real party to the controversy, so also it should be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an artificial entity is a citizen.  That argument is, to put it mildly, less than compelling.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>As an alternative ground for finding complete diversity, Arkoma asserts that the Fifth Circuit correctly determined its citizenship solely by reference to the citizenship of its general partners, without regard to the citizenship of its limited partners.  Only the general partners, it points out, "manage the assets, control the litigation, and bear the risk of liability for the limited partnership\'s debts," and, more broadly, "have exclusive and complete management and control of the operations of the partnership."  Brief for Respondent 30, 36.  This approach of looking to the citizenship of only some of the members of the artificial entity finds even less support in our precedent than looking to the State of organization (for which one could at least point to <em>Russell</em>).  We have never held that an artificial entity, suing or being sued in its own name, can invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts based on the citizenship of some but not all of its members.  No doubt some members of the joint stock company in <em>Chapman,</em> the labor union in <em>Bouligny,</em> and the limited partnership association in <em>Great Southern</em> exercised greater control over their respective entities than other members.  But such considerations have played no part in our decisions.</p>\n<p>To support its approach, Arkoma seeks to press <em>Navarro</em> into service once again, arguing that, just as that case looked to the trustees to determine the citizenship of the business trust, so also here we should look to the general partners, who have the management powers, in determining the citizenship of this partnership.  As we have already explained, however, <em>Navarro</em> had nothing to do with the citizenship of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="193">Page 494 U.

Not a single case the dissent discusses, neither old nor new, supports that assertion.  <em>Deveaux,</em> which was in any event overruled by <em>Letson,</em> seems to be applying not a "real party to the controversy" test, but rather the principle that, for jurisdictional purposes, the corporation has no substance, and merely "represents" its shareholders, <em>see</em> 5 Cranch, at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html#90">9 U.

[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  From the fictional <em>Marshall,</em> the dissent must leap almost a century and a third to <em>Navarro</em> to find a "real party to the controversy" analysis that discusses "control."  That case, as we have said, is irrelevant, since it involved not a juridical person but the distinctive common law institution of trustees.</p>\n<p>The dissent finds its position supported, rather than contradicted, by the trilogy of <em>Chapman, Great Southern,</em> and <em>Bouligny</em> -- cases that did involve juridical persons but that did not apply "real party to the controversy" analysis, much less a "control" test as the criterion for that status.  In those cases, the dissent explains, "the members of each association held equivalent power and control over the association\'s assets, business, and litigation."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#202">494 U.

It seeks to establish this factual matter, however, not from the text of the opinions (where not the slightest discussion of the point appears) but, for <em>Chapman,</em> by citation of scholarly commentary dealing with the general characteristics of joint stock company agreements, with no reference to (because the record does not contain) the particular agreement at issue in the case, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#202">494 U.

But, as must be evident from our earlier discussion, that has been the character of our jurisprudence in this field after <em>Letson.</em>  See Currie, The Federal Courts and the American Law Institute, 36 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 35 (1968).  Arkoma is undoubtedly correct that limited partnerships are functionally similar to "other types of organizations that have access to federal courts," and is perhaps correct that "[c]onsiderations of basic fairness and substance over form require that limited partnerships receive similar treatment."  Brief for Respondent 33.  Similar arguments were made in <em>Bouligny.</em>  The District Court there had upheld removal because it could divine "\'no common sense reason for treating an unincorporated national labor union differently from a corporation,\'" 382 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html#146">382 U.

S. 150</a></span>.  We concluded, however, that "[w]hether unincorporated labor unions ought to be assimilated to the status of corporations for diversity purposes," id, at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html#153">382 U.

S. 147</a></span>.  In other words, having entered the field of diversity policy with regard to artificial entities once (and forcefully) in <em>Letson,</em> we have left further adjustments to be made by Congress.</p>\n<p>Congress has not been idle.  In 1958 it revised the rule established in <em>Letson,</em> providing that a corporation shall be deemed a citizen not only of its State of incorporation but also "of the State where it has its principal place of business."  28 U.S.C.A. \xc2\xa7 1332(c) (Oct.1989 Supp.).  No provision was made for the treatment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 494 U. S. 197</a></p><p> of artificial entities other than corporations, although the existence of many new, post-<em>Letson</em> forms of commercial enterprises, including at least the sort of joint stock company at issue in <em>Chapman,</em> the sort of limited partnership association at issue in <em>Great Southern</em>, and the sort of Massachusetts business trust at issue in <em>Navarro,</em> must have been obvious.</p>\n<p>Thus, the course we take today does not so much disregard the policy of accommodating our diversity jurisdiction to the changing realities of commercial organization, as it honors the more important policy of leaving that to the people\'s elected representatives.  Such accommodation is not only performed more legitimately by Congress than by courts, but it is performed more intelligently by legislation than by interpretation of the statutory word "citizen."  The fifty States have created, and will continue to create, a wide assortment of artificial entities possessing different powers and characteristics, and composed of various classes of members with varying degrees of interest and control.  Which of them is entitled to be considered a "citizen" for diversity purposes, and which of their members\' citizenship is to be consulted, are questions more readily resolved by legislative prescription than by legal reasoning, and questions whose complexity is particularly unwelcome at the threshold stage of determining whether a court has jurisdiction.  We have long since decided that, having established special treatment for corporations, we will leave the rest to Congress; we adhere to that decision.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Arkoma argues that even if this Court finds complete diversity lacking with respect to Carden and Limes, we should nonetheless affirm the judgment with respect to Magee because complete diversity indisputably exists between Magee and Arkoma.  This question was not considered by the Court of Appeals.  We decline to decide it in the first instance, and leave it to be resolved by the Court of Appeals on remand. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 494 U.

It "do[es] not consider" "whether the limited partnership is a <em>citizen,\'" but simply "assum[es] it is a citizen," because even if we hold that it is, "we are still required to consider which, if any, of the <em>other citizens before the Court</em> as members of Arkoma Associates are real parties to the controversy."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#198">494 U.

Furthermore, "[t]he only potentially nondiverse party in this case is a limited partner" because "[a]ll <em>other parties,</em> including the general partners and the limited partnership itself, assuming it is a citizen, are diverse."  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).\n</em></p>\n<p>That is the central fallacy from which, for the most part, the rest of the dissent\'s reasoning logically follows.  The question presented today is not which of various parties before the Court should be considered for purposes of determining whether there is complete diversity of citizenship, a question that will generally be answered by application of the "real party to the controversy" test.  There are <em>not,</em> as the dissent assumes, multiple respondents before the Court, but only <em>one:</em>  the artificial entity called Arkoma Associates, a limited partnership.  And what we must decide is the quite different question of how the citizenship of that single artificial entity is to be determined -- which in turn raises the question whether it can (like a corporation) assert its own citizenship, or rather is deemed to possess the citizenship of its members, and, if so, which members.  The dissent fails to cite a single case in which the citizenship of an artificial entity, the issue before us today, has been decided by application of the "real party to the controversy" test that it describes.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#192">494 U.

We point out, not by way of complaint but to prevent confusion, that the criticism is gratuitous, inasmuch as the dissent itself takes no position on this issue, announcing at the very outset that it "do[es] not consider" the question "whether the limited partnership is a <em>citizen.\'"  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#198">494 U.

All other parties, including the general partners and the limited partnership itself, assuming it is a citizen, are diverse.  Thus, the Court has before it a single question -- whether the citizenship of a limited partner must be counted for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  The Court first addresses whether the limited partnership is a "citizen."  I do not consider that issue, because even if we were to hold that a limited partnership is a citizen, we are still required to consider which, if any, of the other citizens before the Court as members of Arkoma Associates are real parties to the controversy, <em>i.e.,</em> which parties have control over the subject of and litigation over the controversy.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html">Marshall v.

Indeed, the Court in this case does not leave the issue to Congress, but rather decides the issue and then invokes deference to Congress to justify its newly formulated rule that the Court will, without analysis of the particular entity before it, count every member of an unincorporated association for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  In my view, the Court properly tackles the issue, because "application of statutes to situations not anticipated by the legislature is a pre-eminently judicial function."

S. 89</a></span>, but concluded that the actual parties to the controversy were "the members of the corporation . . . who come into court, in this case, under their corporate name."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/61/case.html#91">9 U. S. 91</a></span>.  By 1854, the Court no longer characterized the corporation as merely possessing "corporeal qualities," but rather as a "juridical person," which made an even stronger case for recognizing a corporation as a proper party in its own right before the Court.  <em>See Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,</em> 16 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>; <em><span class="l-seealso">See also <a href="/cases/federal/us/43/497/case.html">Louisville, Cincinnati &amp; Charleston R. Co. v.

S. 558</a></span>-559 (1844) (corporation is a person; shareholders\' citizenship will not be counted).</p>\n<p>In <em>Marshall,</em> as in <em>Deveaux,</em> however, the determination whether the corporation was a citizen did not signal the end of the diversity jurisdiction inquiry.  16 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>.  Rather, the Court engaged in a two-part inquiry:  (1) is the corporation a "juridical person" which can serve as a real party to the controversy, <em>see id</em>., at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#327">57 U. S. 327</a></span>-329; and (2) are the shareholders real parties to the controversy.  <em>See id</em>., at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>.  To determine whether the corporation or the shareholders were real parties to the controversy, the Court considered which citizens held control over the business decisions and assets of the corporation and over the initiation and course of litigation involving the corporation.  The corporation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="202">Page 494 U. S. 202</a></p><p> as the representative body of the shareholders, itself had such power.  The shareholders did not.</p>\n<p>"[F]or all the purposes of acting, contracting, and judicial remedy, [shareholders] can speak, act, and plead, only through their representatives or curators.  For the purposes of a suit or controversy, the persons represented by a corporate name can appear only by attorney, appointed by its constitutional organs. . . .  [T]hey are not really parties to the suit or controversy."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid</em>.  Having concluded that the shareholders were not the real parties to the controversy, the Court held that only the state of incorporation of the corporate entity need be counted for purposes of diversity jurisdiction and that the citizenship of the shareholders would be presumed to be that of the state of incorporation.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>-329.  As the Court makes plain in <em>Marshall,</em> consideration of whether the shareholders were real parties to the controversy was a necessary prerequisite to the creation of the legal fiction that their citizenship would be deemed that of the corporation.</p>\n<p>In a series of three cases considering the citizenship of business associations following <em>Marshall,</em> the Court was not called upon to determine which of the citizens before it were the real parties to the controversy because the business associations were not citizens themselves and the members of each association held equivalent power and control over the association\'s assets, business, and litigation.  In <em>Chapman v. Barney,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/129/677/case.html">129 U. S. 677</a></span> (1889), the Court addressed the issue whether a joint stock company was a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  A joint stock company, now a historical anomaly, <em>see</em> A. Bromberg, Crane and Bromberg on Partnership 178, and n. 16 (1968), had several features of the corporate form, <em>e.g.,</em> centralized management and transferability of shares, but was more like a general partnership in that each partner was personally liable and there was only one class of partners.  <em>See</em> Comment, Limited Partnerships and Federal Diversity Jurisdiction, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 384, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 494 U. S. 203</a></p><p> 389, and n. 32 (1978).  Each "partner" had equal power over the conduct of the business by virtue of his power to elect and control the company\'s managers.  Bromberg, <em>supra,</em> at 179, n. 19.  The Court held that a joint stock company was a "mere partnership," and therefore not sufficiently similar to a corporation to justify designating it as a citizen.  129 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/129/677/case.html#682">129 U. S. 682</a></span>.  Hence, the Citizenship of each owner had to be counted for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Because the joint stock company owners were similarly situated in terms of power and control over the company, possessed all of the power that could be exercised over the company\'s business and litigation, and the company itself was not a citizen, the Court was not called upon to determine which of the citizens before it were the real parties to the controversy.</p>\n<p>The Court applied a similar approach in <em>Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/177/449/case.html">177 U. S. 449</a></span> (1900), when it examined a limited partnership association.  Quite unlike the modern limited partnership, the limited partnership association at issue in <em>Great Southern,</em> recognized by very few states, Comment, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev., <em>supra,</em> at 389, n. 36, was a species of business association involving a single class of partners with limited liability who exercised control over the operation of the business by annually electing the managers of the association.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 1874 Pa.Laws, Act. No. 153, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2, 5; Comment, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev., <em>supra,</em> at 389, n. 36.  Not surprisingly, the Court viewed such an organization as more like a partnership than a corporation.  <em>See</em> F. Burdick, Law of Partnership 361-362 (1899) (limited partnership association like corporation in some respects, but generally treated by the courts as a general partnership).  As in the case of the joint stock company, because all partners were similarly situated in terms of power and control over the company, there was no reason for the Court to inquire who, among the partners, were the real parties to the controversy. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 494 U. S. 204</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Steelworkers v. R.H. Bouligny, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html">382 U. S. 145</a></span> (1965), the Court addressed whether a labor union could be treated as an entity for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  The Court held that a labor union is not a juridical person, and therefore, not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  <em>See Mesa Operating Limited Partnership v. Louisiana Intrastate Gas Corp.,</em> 797 F.2d 238, 240-241 (CA5 1986) (union in <em>Bouligny</em> failed to meet party to controversy test).  There was no indication that any of the union members had any greater power over the litigation or the union\'s business and assets than any other member, and, therefore, as in <em>Chapman</em> and <em>Great Southern</em>, the Court was not called upon to decide which of the citizens before it were real parties to the controversy.</p>\n<p>In the next case, in which application of the real party to the controversy test was appropriate, the Court unanimously applied it.  <em>See Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#460">446 U. S. 460</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#464">446 U.

In that case, the Court addressed the question whether the beneficiaries\' citizenship must be counted when the trustees brought suit involving the assets of the trust.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html">446 U. S. 458</a></span>.  Because the trust beneficiaries lacked both control over the conduct of the business and the ability to initiate or control the course of litigation, the Court held that the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries should not be counted.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#464">446 U. S. 464</a></span>-465.</p>\n<p>As <em>Navarro</em> makes clear, the nature of the named party does not settle the question of who are the real parties to the controversy.  In fact, if the Court\'s characterization of the issue before us were correct, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#187">494 U. S. 187</a></span>-188, n. 1., then we seriously erred in <em>Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#464">446 U. S. 464</a></span>-466, when we considered whether the trust beneficiaries were the real parties to the controversy, in light of the fact that they were not named parties to the litigation.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to distinguish <em>Navarro</em> on the ground that it involved not a juridical person, but rather the "distinctive </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 494 U. S. 205</a></p><p> common law institution of trustees."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#194">494 U. S. 194</a></span>.  Such a view is consonant with the Court\'s new diversity jurisdiction analysis announced in this case, but fails to take into account the actual language and analysis in <em>Navarro.</em>  If the nature of the institution of trustees was sufficient to answer the question of which parties to count for diversity jurisdiction purposes in that case, the Court\'s discussion of whether the trust beneficiaries were real parties to the controversy would have been wholly superfluous.  Given that the Court granted certiorari in that case on the very issue whether the citizenship of trust beneficiaries must be counted, and then unanimously applied the real parties to the controversy test, the discussion clearly was not superfluous.</p>\n<p>Application of the parties to the controversy test to the limited partnership yields the conclusion that limited partners should not be considered for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Like the trust beneficiary in <em>Navarro,</em> the limited partner "can neither control the disposition of this action nor intervene in the affairs of the trust except in the most extraordinary situations."  <em>Navarro, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#464">446 U. S. 464</a></span>-465.  <em>See</em> Uniform Limited Partnership Act \xc2\xa7 26, 6 U.L.A. 614 (1969) (limited partner "is not a proper party to proceedings by or against a partnership, except where the object is to enforce a limited partner\'s right against or liability to the partnership"); Uniform Limited Partnership Act \xc2\xa7 1001, 6 U.L.A. 371 (Supp.1989) (derivative actions); Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 29-324 (1989) (general partners of limited partnership have duties and obligations of partners to general partnership); \xc2\xa7 29-209 (general partner is agent of partnership); \xc2\xa7 29-356 (limited partners limited to derivative actions); Arkoma Associates Partnership Agreement, Art. VI, \xc2\xa7 6.1 (general partners have "exclusive and complete control of the operations"); <em>id.</em> \xc2\xa7 7.1 (limited partners "shall not take any part in the control or management of . . . Partnership").  And like the shareholder in <em>Marshall,</em> "for all the purposes of acting, contracting, and judicial remedy, [limited partners] can </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 494 U. S. 206</a></p><p> speak, act, and plead, only through [others]."  <em>Marshall,</em> 16 How. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/57/314/case.html#328">57 U. S. 328</a></span>.  In fact, the limited partner has even less power in the limited partnership than the shareholder does in a corporation.</p>\n<p>"[T]he shareholder . . . retain[s] some measure of control over management through his voting power, while the more restricted role of the limited partner permits restraint [of management] only by his refusal to concur in certain acts for which his consent is required by law."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> Note, Standing of Limited Partners to Sue Derivatively, 65 Colum.L.Rev. 1463, 1478 (1965).  Without the power to "control . . . the assets" or to initiate or "control the litigation," <em>Navarro, supra,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/458/case.html#465">446 U. S. 465</a></span>, the limited partner is not a real party to the controversy and, therefore, should not be counted for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Because the majority of States has adopted the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, this rule would result in uniform treatment of limited partners for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> Uniform Limited Partnership Act, 6 U.L.A. 172, 220 (Supp.1989).</p>\n<p>The commentators are in agreement that the party to the controversy test is the appropriate test to be applied to determine diversity jurisdiction with respect to limited partnerships and that the citizenship of limited partners should not be counted.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Comment, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 418 (citizenship of limited partners should not be counted for purposes of diversity jurisdiction); Note, Who Are the Real Parties In Interest for Purposes of Determining Diversity Jurisdiction for Limited Partnerships?, 61 Wash.U.L.Q. 1051, 1066-1067 (1984) (same); Note, 56 Texas L.Rev. at 250-251 (real party in interest test should be applied to unincorporated business associations to determine whom to count for diversity); <em>see also Colonial Realty Corp. v. Bache &amp; Co.,</em> 358 F.2d 178, 183 (1966) (Friendly, J.) (citizenship of limited partner should not be counted where state law declares partner is not "proper party to proceedings by or against a partnership"). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 494 U. S. 207</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The concern perhaps implicit in the Court\'s holding today is that failure to, consider the citizenship of all the members of an unincorporated business association will expand diversity jurisdiction at a time when our federal courts are already seriously overburdened.  This concern is more illusory than real in the context of unincorporated business associations.  For, despite the Court\'s holding today, unincorporated associations may gain access to the federal courts by bringing or defending suit as a Rule 23 class action, in which case the citizenship of the members of the class would not be considered.  <em>See</em> Federal Diversity Jurisdiction -- Citizenship for Unincorporated Associations, 19 Vand.L.Rev. 984, 991-992 (1966).  Thus, I see little reason to depart in this case from our long settled practice of applying the real parties to the controversy test.</p>\n<p>Because there is complete diversity between petitioners and the limited partnership (assuming that it should be considered a citizen) and each of the general partners, the issue presented by this case is fully resolved by application of the parties to the controversy test.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even though the case does not directly relate to the issue before us, the Court takes pains to address and distinguish <em>Puerto Rico v. Russell &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/476/case.html">288 U. S. 476</a></span> (1933).  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#189">494 U. S. 189</a></span>-190.  The issue in <em>Russell</em> was not diversity, but whether the suit against the <em>sociedad en comandita</em> could be removed from the Insular Court to the United States District Court for Puerto Rico on the ground that no party on one side was a citizen of or domiciled in Puerto Rico.  <em>See</em> 288 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/476/case.html#478">288 U. S. 478</a></span>.  None of the partners were citizens of Puerto Rico, but the Court determined that the <em>sociedad</em> was and, therefore, removal was precluded.  Thus, <em>Russell</em> tells us nothing about whether the citizenship of the <em>sociedad</em>\'s members, unlimited or limited, should be considered for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 494 U. S. 208</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In any event, the Court\'s attempts to distinguish <em>Russell</em> are seriously flawed.  In <em>Russell,</em> the Court examined the Puerto Rican <em>sociedad en comandita,</em> which is the civil law version of the modern limited partnership.  The Court delineated a series of factors and concluded that, under civil law, the <em>sociedad</em> was a "juridical person."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/476/case.html#481">288 U. S. 481</a></span>.  Ironically, the Court in this case endorses the holding of <em>Russell,</em> despite the fact that virtually all of the factors listed are equally applicable to the modern limited partnership.  The Court fails to acknowledge that our modern limited partnership, like the <em>sociedad,</em> finds its origins in the civil law.  The limited partnership originated in Europe in the middle ages, first appearing in France</p>\n<p>"[u]nder the name of la <em>Societe en comandite,</em> . . . mention being made of it in the most ancient commercial records, and in the early mercantile regulations of Marseilles and Montpelier."</p>\n<p><em>Ames v. Downing,</em> 1 Bradf. Surr. 321, 329 (N.Y.1850).  The limited partnership did not find acceptance in the United Kingdom and was not a creature of the common law.  F. Burdick, Law of Partnership 384-385 (2d ed. 1906).  It was first introduced into this country in Louisiana and then New York.  <em>See</em> Note, 65 Colum.L.Rev., at 1464.  Although a "<em>creation of the civil law,\'" the Puerto Rican <em>sociedad</em> was hardly "`exotic.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/185/case.html#190">494 U. S. 190</a></span> (quoting <em>Bouligny,</em> 382 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html#151">382 U. S. 151</a></span>).  Rather, it is yet one of many forms of the limited partnership descended from the ancient French Societe as is the modern limited partnership adopted in this country.  <em>See Ames, supra,</em> at 329-330 (American limited "partnership is, in fact, no novelty, but an institution of considerable antiquity, well known, understood and regulated").  It is hardly an answer to the history of the limited partnership in this country and abroad to assert that it appears 25 years after <em>Steelworkers v. R.H. Bouligny, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/145/case.html">382 U.

S. 189</a></span>, is not blemished by distinguishing between unions and limited partnerships.  It is, however, severely marred by holding </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 494 U.
