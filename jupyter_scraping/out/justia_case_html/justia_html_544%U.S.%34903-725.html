They were convicted of violating the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343, for doing so.  That statute prohibits the use of interstate wires to effect \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Fourth Circuit affirmed their convictions, rejecting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that their prosecution contravened the common-law revenue rule, which bars courts from enforcing foreign sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 tax laws.  The Fourth Circuit also held that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive tax revenue was \xe2\x80\x9cmoney or property\xe2\x80\x9d within \xc2\xa71343\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A plot to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the federal wire fraud statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 1343\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms criminalize a scheme such as petitioners\xe2\x80\x99.  Their smuggling operation satisfies both of the \xc2\xa71343 elements that are in dispute here.  First, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to uncollected excise taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into Canada is \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  That right is an entitlement to collect money from petitioners, the possession of which is \xe2\x80\x9csomething of value\xe2\x80\x9d to the Canadian Government.  <em>McNally</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/350/index.html">483 U. S. 350</a>, 358.  Such valuable entitlements are \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d as that term ordinarily is employed.  Second, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 plot was a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax revenue, because petitioners routinely concealed imported liquor from Canadian officials and failed to declare those goods on customs forms.  See <em>Durland</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/index.html">161 U. S. 306</a>, 313.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x937. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The foregoing construction of \xc2\xa71343 does not derogate from the common-law revenue rule.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Relying on the canon of construction that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatutes which invade the common law \xe2\x80\xa6 are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except where a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/529/index.html">507 U. S. 529</a>, 534, petitioners argue that, to avoid reading \xc2\xa71343 to derogate from the revenue rule, the Court should construe the otherwise-applicable statutory language to except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes.  Whether \xc2\xa71343 derogates from the revenue rule depends on whether reading the statute to reach this prosecution conflicts with a well-established revenue rule principle.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Craft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/274/index.html">535 U. S. 274</a>, 276.  Thus, before concluding that Congress intended to exempt the present prosecution from \xc2\xa71343\xe2\x80\x99s broad reach, the Court must find that the revenue rule clearly barred such a prosecution as of 1952, the year Congress enacted the wire fraud statute.  See <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 22\xe2\x80\x9323.

Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The revenue rule has long been treated as a corollary of the rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Antelope,</em> 10 Wheat. 66, 123.  It was first treated as such in cases prohibiting the enforcement of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the courts of another sovereign, such as suits to enforce tax judgments.  The revenue rule\xe2\x80\x99s grounding in these cases shows that, at its core, it prohibited the collection of tax obligations of foreign nations.  The present prosecution is unlike these classic examples of actions traditionally barred by the revenue rule.  It is not a suit that recovers a foreign tax liability, but is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States to punish domestic criminal conduct.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Cases applying the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in contrast to the direct collection of a tax obligation, cannot bear the weight petitioners place on them.  Many of them were decided after Congress passed the wire fraud statute.  Others come from foreign courts.  And, significantly, none involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a criminal statute to enforce the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s own penal law.  Moreover, none of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 cases barred an action that had as its primary object the deterrence and punishment of fraudulent conduct\xe2\x80\x94a substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax enforcement.  The main object of the action in each of them was the collection of money that would pay foreign tax claims.  The absence of such an object here means that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax collection is incidental and attenuated at best.  Thus, it cannot be said whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule.  Petitioners answer unpersuasively that the recovery of taxes is indeed the object of this suit because restitution of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s lost tax revenue is required under the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996.  Whether restitution is mandatory is irrelevant here because \xc2\xa71343 advances the Government\xe2\x80\x99s independent interest in punishing fraudulent domestic criminal conduct.  In any event, if awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contrary to the revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the later enacted restitution statute not to allow such awards, rather than to assume that it impliedly repealed \xc2\xa71343 as applied to this prosecution.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0Also unavailing is petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument that early English common-law cases holding unenforceable contracts executed to evade other nations\xe2\x80\x99 revenue laws demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d enforcement of such laws is at the very core of the revenue rule, rather than at its margins.  Those early cases were driven by an interest in lessening the commercial disruption caused by high tariffs.  By the mid-20th century, however, that rationale was supplanted, and courts began to apply the revenue rule to tax obligations on the strength of the analogy between a country\xe2\x80\x99s revenue laws and its penal ones.  Because the early English cases rested on a far different foundation from that on which the revenue rule came to rest, they say little about whether the wire fraud statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th century form.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iv)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 criminal prosecution \xe2\x80\x9cenforces\xe2\x80\x9d Canadian revenue law in an attenuated sense, but not in a sense that clearly would contravene the revenue rule.  That rule never proscribed all enforcement of foreign revenue law.  For example, at the same time they were enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of violating foreign revenue law, English courts also considered void foreign contracts that lacked tax stamps required under foreign revenue law.  The line the revenue rule draws between impermissible and permissible \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of foreign revenue law has therefore always been unclear.  The uncertainty persisted in American cases, which demonstrate that the extent to which the revenue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign revenue laws was unsettled as of 1952.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The traditional rationales for the revenue rule do not plainly suggest that it barred this prosecution.  First, this prosecution poses little risk of causing the principal evil against which the revenue rule was traditionally thought to guard: judicial evaluation of the revenue policies of foreign sovereigns.  This action was brought by the Executive, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/304/index.html">299 U. S. 304</a>, 320.  Although a prosecution like this one requires a court to recognize foreign law to determine whether the defendant violated U. S. law, it may be assumed that by electing to prosecute, the Executive has assessed this prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s impact on this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Canada, and concluded that it poses little danger of causing international friction.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 broader argument that the revenue rule avoids giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws worries the Court little.  The present prosecution, if authorized by the wire fraud statute, embodies the policy choice of the two political branches of Government\xe2\x80\x94Congress and the Executive\xe2\x80\x94to free the interstate wires from fraudulent use, irrespective of the object of the fraud.  Such a reading of \xc2\xa71343 gives effect to that considered policy choice and therefore poses no risk of advancing Canadian policies illegitimately.  Finally, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that courts lack the competence to examine the validity of unfamiliar foreign tax schemes is not persuasive here.  Foreign law posed no unmanageable complexity in this case, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1 gives federal courts sufficient means to resolve any incidental foreign law issues that may arise in wire fraud prosecutions.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation does not give \xc2\xa71343 extraterritorial effect.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 offense was complete the moment they executed their scheme intending to defraud Canada of tax revenue inside the United States.  See <em>Durland, supra,</em> at 313.  Therefore, only domestic conduct is at issue here.  In any event, because \xc2\xa71343 punishes frauds executed \xe2\x80\x9cin interstate or foreign commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not a statute that involves only domestic concerns.

The question presented in this case is whether a plot to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343 (2000 ed., Supp. II).  Because the plain terms of \xc2\xa71343 criminalize such a scheme, and because this construction of the wire fraud statute does not derogate from the common-law revenue rule, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners Carl J. Pasquantino, David B. Pasquantino, and Arthur Hilts were indicted for and convicted of federal wire fraud for carrying out a scheme to smuggle large quantities of liquor into Canada from the United States.  According to the evidence presented at trial, the Pasquantinos, while in New York, ordered liquor over the telephone from discount package stores in Maryland.  See 336 F.\xc2\xa03d 321, 325 (CA4 2003) (en banc).  They employed Hilts and others to drive the liquor over the Canadian border, without paying the required excise taxes.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The drivers avoided paying taxes by hiding the liquor in their vehicles and failing to declare the goods to Canadian customs officials.  <em>Id.</em>, at 333.  During the time of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 smuggling operation, between 1996 and 2000, Canada heavily taxed the importation of alcoholic beverages.  See 1997 S.\xc2\xa0C., ch. 36, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa721.1(1), 21.2(1); Excise Act Schedule 1.(1), R.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C., ch. E\xe2\x80\x9314 (1985); Excise Act 2001, Schedule 4, ch. 22, 2002 S.\xc2\xa0C. 239.  Uncontested evidence at trial showed that Canadian taxes then due on alcohol purchased in the United States and transported to Canada were approximately double the liquor\xe2\x80\x99s purchase price.  App. 65\xe2\x80\x9366.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before trial, petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it stated no wire fraud offense.  The wire fraud statute prohibits the use of interstate wires to effect \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343 (2000 ed., Supp. II).  Petitioners contended that the Government lacked a sufficient interest in enforcing the revenue laws of Canada, and therefore that they had not committed wire fraud.  App. 48\xe2\x80\x9357.  The District Court denied the motion and the case went to trial.  The jury convicted petitioners of wire fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, again urging that the indictment failed to state a wire fraud offense.  They argued that their prosecution contravened the common-law revenue rule, because it required the court to take cognizance of the revenue laws of Canada.  Over Judge Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, the panel agreed and reversed the convictions.  305 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 295 (2002).  Petitioners also argued that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to collect taxes from them was not \xe2\x80\x9cmoney or property\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the wire fraud statute, but the panel unanimously rejected that argument.  <em>Id.</em>, at 294\xe2\x80\x93295; <em>id.</em>, at 299 (Hamilton, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc, vacated the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and affirmed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions.  336 F.\xc2\xa03d 321 (CA4 2003).  It concluded that the common-law revenue rule, rather than barring any recognition of foreign revenue law, simply allowed courts to refuse to enforce the tax judgments of foreign nations, and therefore did not preclude the Government from prosecuting petitioners.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327\xe2\x80\x93329.  The Court of Appeals held as well that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive tax revenue was \xe2\x80\x9cmoney or property\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the wire fraud statute. <em> Id.</em>, at 331\xe2\x80\x93332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether a scheme to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the wire fraud statute.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/972/index.html">541 U. S. 972</a> (2004).  Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boots</em>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d 580, 587 (CA1 1996) (holding that a scheme to defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue does not violate the wire fraud statute), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trapilo</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa03d 547, 552\xe2\x80\x93553 (CA2 1997) (holding that a scheme to defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue violates the wire fraud statute).  We agree with the Court of Appeals that it does and therefore affirm the judgment below.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider whether petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct falls within the literal terms of the wire fraud statute.  The statute prohibits using interstate wires to effect \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343 (2000 ed., Supp. II).  Two elements of this crime, and the only two that petitioners dispute here, are that the defendant engage in a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cobject of the fraud \xe2\x80\xa6 be \xe2\x80\x98[money or] property\xe2\x80\x99 in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cleveland</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/12/index.html">531 U. S. 12</a>, 26 (2000).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 smuggling operation satisfies both elements.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking the latter element first, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to uncollected excise taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into Canada is \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d in its hands.  This right is an entitlement to collect money from petitioners, the possession of which is \xe2\x80\x9csomething of value\xe2\x80\x9d to the Government of Canada.  <em>McNally</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/350/index.html">483 U. S. 350</a>, 358 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Valuable entitlements like these are \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d as that term ordinarily is employed.  See <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen interpreting a statute, we must give words their ordinary or natural meaning\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1382 (4th ed. 1951) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cextend[ing] to every species of valuable right and interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  Had petitioners complied with this legal obligation, they would have paid money to Canada.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tax evasion deprived Canada of that money, inflicting an economic injury no less than had they embezzled funds from the Canadian treasury.  The object of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 scheme was to deprive Canada of money legally due, and their scheme thereby had as its object the deprivation of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common law of fraud confirms this characterization of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s right to excise taxes.  The right to be paid money has long been thought to be a species of property.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153\xe2\x80\x93155 (1768) (classifying a right to sue on a debt as personal property); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *351 (same).  Consistent with that understanding, fraud at common law included a scheme to deprive a victim of his entitlement to money.   For instance, a debtor who concealed his assets when settling debts with his creditors thereby committed common-law fraud.  1 J. Story, Equity Jurisprudence \xc2\xa7378 (I. Redfield 10th rev. ed. 1870); <em>Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Janssen</em>, 28 Eng. Rep. 82, 2 Ves. Sen. 125 (ch. 1750); 1 S. Rapalje &amp; R. Lawrence, A Dictionary of American and English Law 546 (1883).  That made sense given the economic equivalence between money in hand and money legally due.  The fact that the victim of the fraud happens to be the Government, rather than a private party, does not lessen the injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that the right to tax revenue is property in Canada\xe2\x80\x99s hands, contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 contentions, is consistent with <em>Cleveland</em>, <em>supra</em>.  In that case, the defendant, Cleveland, had obtained a video poker license by making false statements on his license application.  <em>Id.</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  We held that a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in an unissued video poker license was not \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d because the interest in choosing particular licensees was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98purely regulatory\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[could not] be economic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  We also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government nowhere allege[d] that Cleveland defrauded the State of any money to which the State was entitled by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cleveland </em>is different from this case.  Unlike a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in allocating a video poker license to particular applicants, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to tax revenue is a straightforward \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d interest.  There was no suggestion in <em>Cleveland</em> that the defendant aimed at depriving the State of any money due under the license; quite the opposite, there was \xe2\x80\x9cno dispute that [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s partnership] paid the State of Louisiana its proper share of revenue\xe2\x80\x9d due.  <em>Id.</em>, at 22.  Here, by contrast, the Government alleged and proved that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 scheme aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it was entitled by law.  Canada could hardly have a more \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic\xe2\x80\x9d interest than in the receipt of tax revenue.  <em>Cleveland </em>is therefore consistent with our conclusion that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement is \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d as that word is used in the wire fraud statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the second element at issue here, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 plot was a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax revenue.  The evidence showed that petitioners routinely concealed imported liquor from Canadian officials and failed to declare those goods on customs forms.  See 336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 333.  By this conduct, they represented to Canadian customs officials that their drivers had no goods to declare.  This, then, was a scheme \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to defraud by representations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Durland</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/index.html">161 U. S. 306</a>, 313 (1896), and therefore a \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d Canada of taxes due on the smuggled goods.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither the antismuggling statute, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7546,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] nor U. S. tax treaties, see <em>Attorney General of Canada</em> v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc</em>., 268 F.\xc2\xa03d 103, 115\xe2\x80\x93119 (CA2 2001), convince us that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 scheme falls outside the terms of the wire fraud statute.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Unlike the treaties and the antismuggling statute, the wire fraud statute punishes fraudulent use of domestic wires, whether or not such conduct constitutes smuggling, occurs aboard a vessel, or evades foreign taxes.  See <em>post</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa09 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting that the antismuggling statute does not apply to this prosecution).  Petitioners would be equally liable if they had used interstate wires to defraud Canada not of taxes due, but of money from the Canadian treasury.  The wire fraud statute \xe2\x80\x9capplies without differentiation\xe2\x80\x9d to these two categories of fraud.  <em>Clark</em> v. <em>Martinez, </em>543 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6).  \xe2\x80\x9cTo give these same words a different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We therefore decline to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret [this] criminal statute more narrowly than it is written.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brogan</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/522/398/index.html">522 U. S. 398</a>, 406 (1998).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 revenue rule argument.  Petitioners argue that, to avoid reading \xc2\xa71343 to derogate from the common-law revenue rule, we should construe the otherwise-applicable language of the wire fraud statute to except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes.  Their argument relies on the canon of construction that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatutes which invade the common law \xe2\x80\xa6 are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except where a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/529/index.html"></a><a href="/us/507/529/index.html">507 U. S. 529</a>, 534 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  This presumption is, however, no bar to a construction that conflicts with a common-law rule if the statute \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speak[s] directly\xe2\x80\x99 to the question addressed by the common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether the wire fraud statute derogates from the common-law revenue rule depends, in turn, on whether reading \xc2\xa71343 to reach this prosecution conflicts with a well-established revenue rule principle.  We clarified this constraint on the application of the nonderogation canon in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Craft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/274/index.html">535 U. S. 274</a> (2002).  The issue in <em>Craft</em> was whether the property interest of a tenant by the entirety was exempt from a federal tax lien.  <em>Id.</em>, at 276.  We construed the federal tax lien statute to reach such a property interest, despite the tension between that construction and the common-law rule that entireties property enjoys immunity from liens, because this \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law rule was not so well established with respect to the application of a federal tax lien that we must assume that Congress considered the impact of its enactment on the question now before us.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 288.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  So too here, before we may conclude that Congress intended to exempt the present prosecution from the broad reach of the wire fraud statute, we must find that the common-law revenue rule clearly barred such a prosecution.  We examine the state of the common law as of 1952, the year Congress enacted the wire fraud statute.  See <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 22\xe2\x80\x9323 (1999).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The wire fraud statute derogates from no well-established revenue rule principle.  We are aware of no common-law revenue rule case decided as of 1952 that held or clearly implied that the revenue rule barred the United States from prosecuting a fraudulent scheme to evade foreign taxes.  The traditional rationales for the revenue rule, moreover, do not plainly suggest that it swept so broadly.  We consider these two points in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider common-law revenue rule jurisprudence as it existed in 1952, the year Congress enacted \xc2\xa71343.  Since the late 19th and early 20th century, courts have treated the common-law revenue rule as a corollary of the rule that, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>The Antelope,</em> 10 Wheat. 66, 123 (1825).  The rule against the enforcement of foreign penal statutes, in turn, tracked the common-law principle that crimes could only be prosecuted in the country in which they were committed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> J. Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws \xc2\xa7620, p. 840 (M. Bigelow ed. 8th ed. 1883).  The basis for inferring the revenue rule from the rule against foreign penal enforcement was an analogy between foreign revenue laws and penal laws.  See<em> Wisconsin</em> v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/127/265/index.html">127 U. S. 265</a>, 290 (1888); Leflar, Extrastate Enforcement of Penal and Governmental Claims, 46 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 193, 219 (1932) (hereinafter Leflar).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts first drew that inference in a line of cases prohibiting the enforcement of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the courts of another sovereign, such as a suit to enforce a tax judgment.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The revenue rule\xe2\x80\x99s grounding in these cases shows that, at its core, it prohibited the collection of tax obligations of foreign nations.  Unsurprisingly, then, the revenue rule is often stated as prohibiting the collection of foreign tax claims.  See Brief for Petitioners 16 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most straightforward application of the revenue rule arises when a foreign sovereign attempts to sue directly in its own right to enforce a tax judgment in the courts of another nation\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present prosecution is unlike these classic examples of actions traditionally barred by the revenue rule.  It is not a suit that recovers a foreign tax liability, like a suit to enforce a judgment.  This is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States in its sovereign capacity to punish domestic criminal conduct.  Petitioners nevertheless argue that common-law revenue rule jurisprudence as of 1952 prohibited such prosecutions.  Revenue rule cases, however, do not establish that proposition, much less clearly so.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners first analogize the present action to several cases that have applied the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in contrast to the direct collection of a tax obligation.  They cite, for example, a decision of an Irish trial court holding that a private liquidator could not recover assets unlawfully distributed and moved to Ireland by a corporate director, because the recovery would go to satisfy the company\xe2\x80\x99s Scottish tax obligations.  <em>Peter Buchanan Ltd. </em>v. <em>McVey</em>, 1955 A.\xc2\xa0C. 516, 529\xe2\x80\x93530 (Ir. H. Ct. 1950), app. dism\xe2\x80\x99d, 1955 A.\xc2\xa0C. 530 (Ir. Sup. Ct. 1951).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The court found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole object of the liquidation proceedings in Scotland was to collect a revenue debt,\xe2\x80\x9d because if the liquidator won, \xe2\x80\x9cevery penny recovered after paying certain costs \xe2\x80\xa6 could be claimed by the Scottish Revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 530.  According to the <em>Buchanan</em> court, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n every case the substance of the claim must be scrutinized, and if it then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue it must be rejected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 529.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Buchanan</em> and the other cases on which petitioners rely cannot bear the weight petitioners place on them.  Many of them were decided after 1952, too late for the Congress that passed the wire fraud statute to have relied on them.  Others come from foreign courts.  Drawing sure inferences regarding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent from such foreign citations is perilous, as several of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 cases illustrate.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More important, none of these cases clearly establishes that the revenue rule barred this prosecution.  None involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a criminal statute.  The difference is significant.  An action by a domestic sovereign enforces the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s own penal law.  A prohibition on the enforcement of <em>foreign</em> penal law does not plainly prevent the Government from enforcing a <em>domestic</em> criminal law.  Such an extension, to our knowledge, is unprecedented in the long history of either the revenue rule or the rule against enforcement of penal laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, none of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 cases (with the arguable exception of <em>Banco Do Brasil, S.\xc2\xa0A. </em>v.<em> A.\xc2\xa0C. Israel Commodity Co., </em>12 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 371, 190 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 235 (App. 1963)) barred an action that had as its primary object the deterrence and punishment of fraudulent conduct\xe2\x80\x94a substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax enforcement.  The main object of the action in each of those cases was the collection of money that would pay foreign tax claims.  The absence of such an object in this action means that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax collection is incidental and attenuated at best, making it not plainly one in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole object of the suit is to collect tax for a foreign revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buchanan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 529.  Even those courts that as of 1952 had extended the revenue rule beyond its core prohibition had not faced a case closely analogous to this one\xe2\x80\x94and thus we cannot say with any reasonable certainty whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners answer that the recovery of taxes is indeed the object of this suit, because restitution of the lost tax revenue to Canada is required under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73663A\xe2\x80\x933664 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  We do not think it matters whether the provision of restitution is mandatory in this prosecution.  Regardless, the wire fraud statute advances the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s independent interest in punishing fraudulent domestic criminal conduct, a significant feature absent from all of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 revenue rule cases.  The purpose of awarding restitution in this action is not to collect a foreign tax, but to mete out appropriate criminal punishment for that conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, any conflict between mandatory restitution and the revenue rule would not change our holding today.  If awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contrary to the revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act not to allow such awards, rather than to assume that the later enacted restitution statute impliedly repealed \xc2\xa71343 as applied to frauds against foreign sovereigns. </p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are no more persuaded by a second line of cases on which petitioners rely.  Petitioners analogize the present case to early English common-law cases from which the revenue rule originally derived.  Those early cases involved contract law, and they held that contracts executed with the purpose of evading the revenue laws of other nations were enforceable, notwithstanding the rule against enforcing contracts with illegal purposes.  See <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Lawson</em>, Cas. T. Hard. 85, 89\xe2\x80\x9390, 95 Eng. Rep. 53, 55\xe2\x80\x9356 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1734); <em>Planche </em>v. <em>Fletcher</em>, 1 Dougl. 251, 99 Eng. Rep. 164 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1779).  Petitioners argue that these cases demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d enforcement of revenue laws is at the very core of the common-law revenue rule, rather than at its margins.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The argument is unavailing.  By the mid-20th century, the revenue rule had developed into a doctrine very different from its original form.  Early revenue rule cases were driven by the interest in lessening the commercial disruption caused by the high tariffs of the day.  As Lord Hardwicke explained, if contracts that aimed at circumventing foreign revenue laws were unenforceable, \xe2\x80\x9cit would cut off all benefit of such trade from this kingdom, which would be of very bad consequence to the principal and most beneficial branches of our trade.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boucher</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 89, 95 Eng. Rep., at 56.  By the 20th century, however, that rationale for the revenue rule had been supplanted.  By then, as we have explained, courts had begun to apply the revenue rule to tax obligations on the strength of the analogy between a country\xe2\x80\x99s revenue laws and its penal ones, see <em>supra,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, superseding the original promotion-of-commerce rationale for the rule.  Dodge, Breaking the Public Law Taboo, 43 Harv. Int\xe2\x80\x99l L.\xc2\xa0J. 161, 178 (2002); <em>Buchanan</em>, 1955 A.\xc2\xa0C., at 522\xe2\x80\x93524, 528\xe2\x80\x93529.  The early English cases rest on a far different foundation from that on which the revenue rule came to rest.  They thus say little about whether the wire fraud statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th century form.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Granted, this criminal prosecution \xe2\x80\x9cenforces\xe2\x80\x9d Canadian revenue law in an attenuated sense, but not in a sense that clearly would contravene the revenue rule.  From its earliest days, the revenue rule never proscribed all enforcement of foreign revenue law.  For example, at the same time they were enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of violating foreign revenue law, English courts also considered void foreign contracts that lacked tax stamps required under foreign revenue law.  See <em>Alves </em>v. <em>Hodgson</em>, 7 T.\xc2\xa0R. 241, 243, 101 Eng. Rep. 953, 955 (K.\xc2\xa0B. 1797); <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Levy</em>, 3 Camp. 166, 167, 170 Eng. Rep. 1343, 1343 (N.\xc2\xa0P. 1812).  Like the present prosecution, cases voiding foreign contracts under foreign law no doubt \xe2\x80\x9cenforced\xe2\x80\x9d foreign revenue law in the sense that they encouraged the payment of foreign taxes; yet they fell outside the revenue rule\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The line the revenue rule draws between impermissible and permissible \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of foreign revenue law has therefore always been unclear.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The uncertainty persisted in American courts that recognized the revenue rule.  In one of the earliest appearances of the revenue rule in America, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire entertained an action that required extensive recognition of a sister State\xe2\x80\x99s revenue laws.  <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Sargeant</em>, 13 N.\xc2\xa0H. 321 (1843).  There, the plaintiff sought damages, alleging that a Vermont selectman had imposed an illegal tax on him.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331.  The court found that the revenue rule did not bar the action, <em>id.</em>, at 331\xe2\x80\x93332, though the suit required the court to enforce the revenue laws of Vermont.  See <em>id.</em>, at 335\xe2\x80\x93338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, in <em>In\xc2\xa0re Hollins</em>, 79 Misc. 200, 139 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 713 (Sur. Ct.), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 160 App. Div. 886, 144 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 1121 (1913);<em> </em>aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 212 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 567, 106 N.\xc2\xa0E. 1034 (App. 1914) <em>(per curiam)</em>, the court held that an estate executor could satisfy foreign taxes due on a decedent\xe2\x80\x99s estate out of property of the estate, notwithstanding a legatee\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the revenue rule barred authorizing such payments.  79 Misc., at 207\xe2\x80\x93208, 139 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S., at 716\xe2\x80\x93717.  The court explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhile it is doubtless true that this court will not aid a foreign government in the enforcement of its revenue laws, it will not refuse to direct a just and equitable administration of that part of an estate within its jurisdiction merely because such direction would result in the enforcement of such revenue laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 208, 139 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S., at 717.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases demonstrate that the extent to which the revenue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign revenue laws was unsettled as of 1952.  Following the reasoning of <em>In\xc2\xa0re Hollins</em>, for instance, Congress might well have thought that courts would enforce the wire fraud statute, even if doing so might incidentally recognize Canadian revenue law.  The uncertainty highlights that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ndirect enforcement is \xe2\x80\xa6 easier to describe than to define,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit is sometimes difficult to draw the line between an issue involving merely recognition of a foreign law and indirect enforcement of it.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 A. Dicey &amp; J. Morris, Conflict of Laws 90 (L. Collins gen. ed. 13th ed. 2000).  Even if the present prosecution is analogous to the indirect enforcement cases on which petitioners rely, those cases do not yield a rule sufficiently well established to narrow the wire fraud statute in the context of this criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having concluded that revenue rule jurisprudence is no clear bar to this prosecution, we next turn to whether the purposes of the revenue rule, as articulated in the relevant authorities, suggest differently.  They do not.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, this prosecution poses little risk of causing the principal evil against which the revenue rule was traditionally thought to guard: judicial evaluation of the policy-laden enactments of other sovereigns.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mitchell</em>, 30 F.\xc2\xa02d 600, 604 (CA2 1929) (L. Hand, J., concurring).  As Judge Hand put it, allowing courts to enforce another country\xe2\x80\x99s revenue laws was thought to be a delicate inquiry</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwhen it concerns the relations between the foreign state and its own citizens \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  To pass upon the provisions for the public order of another state is, or at any rate should be, beyond the powers of a court; it involves the relations between the states themselves, with which courts are incompetent to deal, and which are intrusted to other authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present prosecution creates little risk of causing international friction through judicial evaluation of the policies of foreign sovereigns.  This action was brought by the Executive to enforce a statute passed by Congress.  In our system of government, the Executive is \xe2\x80\x9cthe sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations,\xe2\x80\x9d United States</em> v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/299/304/index.html">299 U. S. 304</a>, 320 (1936), and has ample authority and competence to manage \xe2\x80\x9cthe relations between the foreign state and its own citizens\xe2\x80\x9d and to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cembarass[ing] its neighbor[s],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Moore</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 604 (L. Hand, J., concurring); see also <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Waterman S.\xc2\xa0S. Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/103/index.html">333 U. S. 103</a>, 111 (1948).  True, a prosecution like this one requires a court to recognize foreign law to determine whether the defendant violated U. S. law.  But we may assume that by electing to bring this prosecution, the Executive has assessed this prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s impact on this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Canada, and concluded that it poses little danger of causing international friction.  We know of no common-law court that has applied the revenue rule to bar an action accompanied by such a safeguard, and neither petitioners nor the dissent directs us to any.  The greater danger, in fact, would lie in our judging this prosecution barred based on the foreign policy concerns animating the revenue rule, concerns that we have \xe2\x80\x9cneither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d to evaluate.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More broadly, petitioners argue that the revenue rule avoids giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws, regardless of whether courts need pass judgment on such laws.  See <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba</em> v. <em>Sabbatino</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/398/index.html">376 U. S. 398</a>, 448 (1964) (White, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign state, since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d).  This worries us little here.  The present prosecution, if authorized by the wire fraud statute, embodies the policy choice of the two political branches of our Government\xe2\x80\x94Congress and the Executive\xe2\x80\x94to free the interstate wires from fraudulent use, irrespective of the object of the fraud.  Such a reading of the wire fraud statute gives effect to that considered policy choice.  It therefore poses no risk of advancing the policies of Canada illegitimately.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still a final revenue rule rationale petitioners urge is the concern that courts lack the competence to examine the validity of unfamiliar foreign tax schemes.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71343, required the Government to allege and prove that the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud a victim\xe2\x80\x94here, the Canadian Government\xe2\x80\x94of money or property.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5 (describing Canada as the \xe2\x80\x9cvictim\xe2\x80\x9d of a scheme having \xe2\x80\x9cas its object the deprivation of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98property\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  To establish the fraudulent nature of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 scheme and the Canadian Government\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to the money withheld by the defendants, the United States offered proof at trial that Canada imposes import duties on liquor, and that the defendants intended to evade those duties.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a; App. 65\xe2\x80\x9374.  The defendants\xe2\x80\x99 convictions for wire fraud therefore resulted from, and could not have been obtained without proof of, their intent to violate Canadian revenue laws.  See <em>United States </em>v.<em> Pierce</em>, 224 F. 3d 158, 166\xe2\x80\x93168 (CA2 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf no Canadian duty or tax actually existed, the [defendants] were no more guilty of wire fraud than they would have been had they used the wires\xe2\x80\x9d to smuggle liquor into New York City, \xe2\x80\x9cin the sincere but mistaken belief that New York City imposes a duty on such \xe2\x80\xa6 shipments.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Canadian customs and tax laws continued at sentencing.  The United States Sentencing Guidelines mandated that the defendants be sentenced on the basis of, among other things, the amount by which the defendants defrauded the Canadian Government.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72F1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 2000).  Accordingly, the District Court calculated the number of cases of liquor smuggled into Canada and the aggregate amount of import duties evaded by the defendants.  The court concluded that the Pasquantinos avoided over $2.5 million in Canadian duties, and Hilts, over $1.1 million.  See App. 97\xe2\x80\x93101, 104\xe2\x80\x93105.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The resulting offense-level increases yielded significantly longer sentences for the defendants.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As Judge Gregory stated in dissent below, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe bulk of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 sentences were related, not to the American crime of wire fraud, but to the Canadian crime of tax evasion,\xe2\x80\x9d shows that \xe2\x80\x9cthis case was primarily about enforcing Canadian law.\xe2\x80\x9d  336 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 342\xe2\x80\x93343.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Expansively interpreting the text of the wire fraud statute, which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of \xe2\x80\xa6 fraudulent pretenses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court today upholds the Government\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of \xc2\xa71343 essentially to enforce foreign tax law.  This Court has several times observed that the wire fraud statute has a long arm, extending to \xe2\x80\x9ceverything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present, or suggestions and promises as to the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Durland</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/161/306/index.html">161 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71956(c)(1) (defendant must know that transaction involved the proceeds of activity \xe2\x80\x9cthat constitutes a felony under State, Federal, or foreign law\xe2\x80\x9d); 16 U.

These statutes indicate that Congress, which has the sole authority to determine the extraterritorial reach of domestic laws, is fully capable of conveying its policy choice to the Executive and the courts.  I would not assume from legislative silence that Congress left the matter to Executive discretion.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The presumption against extraterritoriality, which guides courts in the absence of congressional direction, provides ample cause to conclude that \xc2\xa71343 does not extend to the instant scheme.  Moreover, as to foreign customs and tax laws, there is scant room for doubt about Congress\xe2\x80\x99 general perspective: Congress has actively indicated, through both domestic legislation and treaties, that it intends \xe2\x80\x9cstrictly [to] limit the parameters of any assistance given\xe2\x80\x9d to foreign nations.  <em>Attorney General of Canada </em>v. <em>R.\xc2\xa0J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc.</em>, 268 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 119; see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Boots</em>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d 580, 588 (CA1 1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cNational [foreign] policy judgments \xe2\x80\xa6 could be undermined if federal courts were to give general effect to wire fraud prosecutions for \xe2\x80\xa6 violating the revenue laws of any country.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Congress has enacted a specific statute criminalizing offenses of the genre committed by the defendants here: 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7546 prohibits transporting goods \xe2\x80\x9cinto the territory of any foreign government in violation of the laws there in force.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 546\xe2\x80\x99s application, however, is expressly conditioned on the foreign government\xe2\x80\x99s enactment of reciprocal legislation prohibiting smuggling into the United States.  See <em>ibid.</em> (prohibition applies \xe2\x80\x9cif under the laws of such foreign government any penalty or forfeiture is provided for violation of the laws of the United States respecting the customs revenue\xe2\x80\x9d).  The reciprocity limitation reflects a legislative determination that this country should not provide other nations with greater enforcement assistance than they give to the United States.  The limitation also cabins the Government\xe2\x80\x99s discretion as to which nation\xe2\x80\x99s customs laws to enforce, thereby avoiding the appearance of prosecutorial overreaching.  See 305 F.\xc2\xa03d 291, 297, n.\xc2\xa09 (CA4 2002) (Gregory, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we draw the line as to which countries\xe2\x80\x99 laws we will help enforce?\xe2\x80\x9d), vacated and reh\xe2\x80\x99g en banc granted (2003).   Significantly, Canada has no statute criminalizing smuggling into the United States, rendering \xc2\xa7546 inapplicable to schemes resembling the one at issue here.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the United States and Canada have negotiated, and the Senate has ratified, a comprehensive tax treaty, in which both nations have committed to providing collection assistance with respect to each other\xe2\x80\x99s tax claims.  See Protocol, Art. 15, \xc2\xb62.  Significantly, the Protocol does not call upon either nation to interpret or calculate liability under the other\xe2\x80\x99s tax statutes; it applies only to tax claims that have been fully and finally adjudicated under the law of the requesting nation.  Further, the Protocol bars assistance in collecting any claim against a citizen or corporation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe requested State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. 15, \xc2\xb68.  These provisions would preclude Canada from obtaining United States assistance in enforcing its claims against the Pasquantinos and Hilts.  I would not assume that Congress understood \xc2\xa71343<font b="1"> to provide the assistance that the United States, in the considered foreign policy judgment of both political branches, has specifically declined to promise.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Complementing the principle that courts ordinarily should await congressional instruction before giving our laws extraterritorial thrust, the common-law revenue rule holds that one nation generally does not enforce another\xe2\x80\x99s tax laws.  See <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba</em> v. <em>Sabbatino,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/398/index.html"></a><a href="/us/376/398/index.html">376 U. S. 398</a>, 448 (1964) (White, J., dissenting) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cour courts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign state\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Milwaukee County</em> v. <em>M. E. White Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/296/268/index.html">296 U. S. 268</a>, 275\xe2\x80\x93276 (1935).  The Government argues, and the Court accepts, that domestic wire fraud prosecutions premised on violations of foreign tax law do not implicate the revenue rule because the court, while it must \xe2\x80\x9crecognize foreign [revenue] law to determine whether the defendant violated U. S. law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 18, need only \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d foreign law \xe2\x80\x9cin an attenuated sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 16; Brief for United States 17\xe2\x80\x9319.  As discussed above, however, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 conduct arguably fell within the scope of \xc2\xa71343 only because of their purpose to evade Canadian customs and tax laws; shorn of that purpose, no other aspect of their conduct was criminal in this country.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936; <em>Boots</em>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 587 (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]pholding defendants\xe2\x80\x99 section 1343 conviction would amount \xe2\x80\xa6 to penal enforcement of Canadian customs and tax laws.\xe2\x80\x9d).  It seems to me unavoidably obvious, therefore, that this prosecution directly implicates the revenue rule.  It is equally plain that Congress did not endeavor, by enacting \xc2\xa71343, to displace that rule.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The application of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73663A, to wire fraud offenses is corroborative.  Section 3663A applies to all \xe2\x80\x9coffense[s] against property,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73663A(c)(1)(A)(ii), and directs that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law \xe2\x80\xa6 the court <em>shall </em>order \xe2\x80\xa6 that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73663A(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The Government acknowledges, however, that it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not urge the district court to order restitution in this case on the theory that it was not \xe2\x80\x98appropriate \xe2\x80\xa6 since the victim is a foreign government and the loss derives from tax laws of the foreign government.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 19\xe2\x80\x9320 (quoting Letter from United States Attorney S. Schenning to United States District Chief Judge J. Motz, Feb. 16, 2001, App. 106).  The Government now disavows this concession.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 (While \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecutor did concede below that restitution was not appropriately ordered,\xe2\x80\x9d it is in fact \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he position of the United States \xe2\x80\xa6 that restitution under the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not infringe the revenue rule.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nevertheless, the very fact that the Government effectively invited the District Court to overlook the mandatory restitution statute out of concern for the revenue rule is revealing.  It further demonstrates that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading of \xc2\xa71343 warrants this Court\xe2\x80\x99s disapprobation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any tension between \xc2\xa73663A and the wire fraud statute, the Government suggests and the Court accepts, would be relieved if this Court construed \xc2\xa73663A to exclude restitution that might encounter a revenue rule shoal.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14;<em> </em>Brief for United States 21.  Congress, however, has expressed with notable clarity a policy of mandatory restitution in <em>all</em> wire fraud prosecutions.  In contrast, Congress was \xe2\x80\x9cquite ambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d concerning \xc2\xa71343\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of schemes to evade foreign taxes.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.  The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, in my view, is an additional indicator that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress \xe2\x80\xa6 [did not] envision foreign taxes to be the object of [a] scheme to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336, and I would construe \xc2\xa71343 accordingly.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the rule of lenity counsels against adopting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71343.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cclose question\xe2\x80\x9d whether the wire fraud statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme \xe2\x80\xa6 to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d includes schemes directed solely at defrauding foreign governments of tax revenues.   See <em>id.</em>, at 33.  We have long held that, when confronted with \xe2\x80\x9ctwo rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other, we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has spoken in clear and definite language.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McNally,</em> 483 U.

A finding that particular conduct constitutes wire fraud therefore exposes certain defendants to the severe criminal penalties and forfeitures provided in both RICO, see \xc2\xa71963 (2000 ed.), and the money laundering statute, \xc2\xa71956(a), (b) (2000 ed. and Supp. II).</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, I would hold that \xc2\xa71343 does not extend to schemes to evade foreign tax and customs laws.

Both parties ask us to determine the scope of \xc2\xa71343, and the presumption against extraterritoriality is a guide to interpretation of the kind courts ordinarily bring to bear in endeavoring to discern the meaning of a legislative text.   Moreover, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s responses to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 revenue rule arguments coincide with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position on the presumption against extraterritoriality.

In making its sentencing recommendation to the court, the Government did not proffer evidence of the precise rate at which Canada taxes liquor imports, or reference any provisions of Canadian law.  Rather, it relied on the trial testimony of an intelligence officer with Canadian Customs, who surmised, based on her experience in working at the border, that Canadian taxes on a $56 case of liquor would be approximately $100.

Thus, if foreign law posed no complexity in this case, it is not because the parties and the court were easily able to interpret and apply Canadian law, but rather because the Government and the court made no serious attempt to do so.  That no such effort was made here, in derogation of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s and the court\xe2\x80\x99s shared obligation to ensure that the calculations potentially affecting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence are as accurate as possible, is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply troubling,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>,<em> </em>and suggests that the Government was unprepared to grapple with the details of foreign revenue laws.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I note that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 sentences were enhanced on the basis of judicial factfindings, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.

A statute\xe2\x80\x99s express application to acts committed in foreign commerce, the Court has repeatedly held, does not in itself indicate a congressional design to give the statute extraterritorial effect.

As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Boots</em>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d 580, 587 (CA1 1996), upholding a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wire fraud conviction in a case like the one here presented \xe2\x80\x9cwould amount functionally to penal enforcement of Canadian customs and tax laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also <em>ibid.</em> (noting that courts \xe2\x80\x9cwill enforce foreign non-tax civil judgments unless due process, jurisdictional, or fundamental public policy considerations interfere\xe2\x80\x9d (citing Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \xc2\xa7483, and Reporters\xe2\x80\x99 Notes, n.\xc2\xa01 (1986)), but \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur courts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign state, since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba</em> v. <em>Sabbatino,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/398/index.html"></a><a href="/us/376/398/index.html">376 U.
