Upon the hearing below, as it appeared that the property of the St. Louis, Kansas City &amp; Colorado Railroad Company had been acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, it was ordered by consent of the parties that the suits of the two companies should be consolidated, and that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 230 U. S. 513</a></p><p> the "findings, statements, and figures as to both companies" should be put "in consolidated form as those of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company."</p>\n<p>Separate decrees were entered in the two cases, and separate appeals and cross-appeals have been taken.</p>\n<p>The same disposition must be made of both.  <em>See Knott v.
